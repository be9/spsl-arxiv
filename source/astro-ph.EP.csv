https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.0009;HST/STIS Lyman-alpha observations of the quiet M dwarf GJ436:  Predictions for the exospheric transit signature of the hot neptune GJ436b; David Ehrenreich,  Alain Lecavelier des Etangs,  Xavier Delfosse;"  Lyman-alpha (Lya) emission of neutral hydrogen (1215.67 Angstr\""om) is the main contributor to the ultraviolet flux of low-mass stars such as M dwarfs. It is also the main light source used in studies of the evaporating upper atmospheres of transiting extrasolar planets with ultraviolet transmission spectroscopy. However, there are very few observations of the Lya emissions of quiet M dwarfs, and none exist for those hosting exoplanets. Here, we present Lya observations of the hot-neptune host star GJ436 with the Hubble Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (HST/STIS). We detect bright emission in the first resolved and high quality spectrum of a quiet M dwarf at Lya. Using an energy diagram for exoplanets and an N-body particle simulation, this detection enables the possible exospheric signature of the hot neptune to be estimated as a ~11% absorption in the Lya stellar emission, for a typical mass-loss rate of 10^10 g/s. The atmosphere of the planet GJ436b is found to be stable to evaporation, and should be readily observable with HST. We also derive a correlation between X-ray and Lya emissions for M dwarfs. This correlation will be useful for predicting the evaporation signatures of planets transiting other quiet M dwarfs.

Sunshine,  Don L. Hampton,  Carey M. Lisse,  Sara Seager,  Joseph F. Veverka;  We present time series photometry and constraints on additional planets in five of the exoplanetary systems studied by the EPOCh (Extrasolar Planet Observation and Characterization) component of the NASA EPOXI mission: HAT-P-4, TrES-3, TrES-2, WASP-3, and HAT-P-7. We conduct a search of the high-precision time series for photometric transits of additional planets. We find no candidate transits with significance higher than our detection limit. From Monte Carlo tests of the time series using putative periods from 0.5 days to 7 days, we demonstrate the sensitivity to detect Neptune-sized companions around TrES-2, sub-Saturn-sized companions in the HAT-P-4, TrES-3, and WASP-3 systems, and Saturn-sized companions around HAT-P-7. We investigate in particular our sensitivity to additional transits in the dynamically favorable 3:2 and 2:1 exterior resonances with the known exoplanets: if we assume coplanar orbits with the known planets, then companions in these resonances with HAT-P-4b, WASP-3b, and HAT-P-7b would be expected to transit, and we can set lower limits on the radii of companions in these systems. In the nearly grazing exoplanetary systems TrES-3 and TrES-2, additional coplanar planets in these resonances are not expected to transit. However, we place lower limits on the radii of companions that would transit if the orbits were misaligned by 2.0 degrees and 1.4 degrees for TrES-3 and TrES-2, respectively. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.0011;Mass-loss rates for transiting exoplanets; David Ehrenreich,  Jean-Michel DÃ©sert;"  Exoplanets at small orbital distances from their host stars are submitted to intense levels of energetic radiations, X-rays and extreme ultraviolet (EUV). Depending on the masses and densities of the planets and on the atmospheric heating efficiencies, the stellar energetic inputs can lead to atmospheric mass loss. These evaporation processes are observable in the ultraviolet during planetary transits. The aim of the present work is to quantify the mass-loss rates (dm/dt), heating efficiencies (eta), and lifetimes for the whole sample of transiting exoplanets, now including hot jupiters, hot neptunes, and hot super-earths. The mass-loss rates and lifetimes are estimated from an ""energy diagram"" for exoplanets, which compares the planet gravitational potential energy to the stellar X/EUV energy deposited in the atmosphere. We estimate the mass-loss rates of all detected transiting planets to be within 10^6 to 10^13 g/s for various conservative assumptions. High heating efficiencies would imply that hot exoplanets such the gas giants WASP-12b and WASP-17b could be completely evaporated within 1 Gyr. We further show that the heating efficiency can be constrained when dm/dt is inferred from observations and the stellar X/EUV luminosity is known. This leads us to suggest that eta ~ 100% in the atmosphere of the hot jupiter HD209458b, while it could be lower for HD189733b. Simultaneous observations of transits in the ultraviolet and X-rays are necessary to further constrain the exospheric properties of exoplanets.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.0026;Hubble Space Telescope Transmission Spectroscopy of the Exoplanet HD  189733b: High-altitude atmospheric haze in the optical and near-UV with STIS; D. K. Sing,  F. Pont,  S. Aigrain,  D. Charbonneau,  J.-M. Desert,  N. Gibson,  R. Gilliland,  W. Hayek,  G. Henry,  H. Knutson,  A. Lecavelier des Etangs,  T. Mazeh,  A. Shporer;  We present Hubble Space Telescope optical and near-ultraviolet transmission spectra of the transiting hot-Jupiter HD189733b, taken with the repaired Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) instrument. The resulting spectra cover the range 2900-5700 Ang and reach per-exposure signal-to-noise levels greater than 11,000 within a 500 Ang bandwidth. We used time series spectra obtained during two transit events to determine the wavelength dependance of the planetary radius and measure the exoplanet's atmospheric transmission spectrum for the first time over this wavelength range. Our measurements, in conjunction with existing HST spectra, now provide a broadband transmission spectrum covering the full optical regime. The STIS data also shows unambiguous evidence of a large occulted stellar spot during one of our transit events, which we use to place constraints on the characteristics of the K dwarf's stellar spots, estimating spot temperatures around Teff~4250 K. With contemporaneous ground-based photometric monitoring of the stellar variability, we also measure the correlation between the stellar activity level and transit-measured planet-to-star radius contrast, which is in good agreement with predictions. We find a planetary transmission spectrum in good agreement with that of Rayleigh scattering from a high-altitude atmospheric haze as previously found from HST ACS camera. The high-altitude haze is now found to cover the entire optical regime and is well characterised by Rayleigh scattering. These findings suggest that haze may be a globally dominant atmospheric feature of the planet which would result in a high optical albedo at shorter optical wavelengths. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.0035;The GROUSE project II: Detection of the Ks-band secondary eclipse of  exoplanet HAT-P-1b; E. J. W. de Mooij (1),  R. J. de Kok (2) S. V. Nefs (1),  I. A. G. Snellen (1),  ((1) Leiden Observatory, Leiden University, (2) SRON Netherlands Institute for Space Research);  Context: Only recently it has become possible to measure the thermal emission from hot-Jupiters at near-Infrared wavelengths using ground-based telescopes, by secondary eclipse observations. This allows the planet flux to be probed around the peak of its spectral energy distribution, which is vital for the understanding of its energy budget. Aims: The aim of the reported work is to measure the eclipse depth of the planet HAT-P-1b at 2.2micron. This planet is an interesting case, since the amount of stellar irradiation it receives falls in between that of the two best studied systems (HD209458 and HD189733), and it has been suggested to have a weak thermal inversion layer. Methods: We have used the LIRIS instrument on the William Herschel Telescope (WHT) to observe the secondary eclipse of HATP-1b in the Ks-band, as part of our Ground-based secondary eclipse (GROUSE) project. The observations were done in staring mode, while significantly defocusing the telescope to avoid saturation on the K=8.4 star. With an average cadence of 2.5 seconds, we collected 6520 frames during one night. Results: The eclipse is detected at the 4sigma level, the measured depth being 0.109+/-0.025%. The uncertainties are dominated by residual systematic effects, as estimated from different reduction/analysis procedures. The measured depth corresponds to a brightness temperature of 2136+150-170K. This brightness temperature is significantly higher than those derived from longer wavelengths, making it difficult to fit all available data points with a plausible atmospheric model. However, it may be that we underestimate the true uncertainties of our measurements, since it is notoriously difficult to assign precise statistical significance to a result when systematic effects are important. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.0199;An Analysis of Jitter and Transit Timing Variations in the HAT-P-13  System; Matthew J. Payne,  Eric B. Ford;  If the two planets in the HAT-P-13 system are coplanar, the orbital states provide a probe of the internal planetary structure. Previous analyses of radial velocity and transit timing data of the system suggested that the observational constraints on the orbital states were rather small. We reanalyze the available data, treating the jitter as an unknown MCMC parameter, and find that a wide range of jitter values are plausible, hence the system parameters are less well constrained than previously suggested. For slightly increased levels of jitter ($\sim 4.5\,m\,s^{-1}$) the eccentricity of the inner planet can be in the range $0<e_{inner}<0.07$, the period and eccentricity of the outer planet can be $440<P_{outer}<470$ days and $0.55<e_{outer}<0.85$ respectively, while the relative pericenter alignment, $\eta$, of the planets can take essentially any value $-180^{\circ}<\eta<+180^{\circ}$. It is therefore difficult to determine whether $e_{inner}$ and $\eta$ have evolved to a fixed-point state or a limit cycle, or to use $e_{inner}$ to probe the internal planetary structure. We perform various transit timing variation (TTV) analyses, demonstrating that current constraints merely restrict $e_{outer}<0.85$, and rule out relative planetary inclinations within $\sim 2^{\circ}$ of $i_{rel}=90^{\circ}$, but that future observations could significantly tighten the restriction on both these parameters. We demonstrate that TTV profiles can readily distinguish the theoretically favored inclinations of $i_{rel}=0^{\circ}\,&\,45^{\circ}$, provided that sufficiently precise and frequent transit timing observations of HAT-P-13b can be made close to the pericenter passage of HAT-P-13c. We note the relatively high probability that HAT-P-13c transits and suggest observational dates and strategies. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.0225;Water ice at low to midlatitudes on Mars; Mathieu Vincendon,  FranÃ§ois Forget,  John Mustard;  In this paper, we analyze water ice occurrences at the surface of Mars using near-infrared observations, and we study their distribution with a climate model. Latitudes between 45{\deg}S and 50{\deg}N are considered. Data from the Observatoire pour la Min\'eralogie, l'Eau, les Glaces et l'Actitit\'e and the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars are used to assess the presence of surface water ice as a function of location and season. A modeling approach combining the 1-D and 3-D versions of the General Circulation Model of the Laboratoire de M\'et\'eorologie Dynamique de Jussieu is developed and successfully compared to observations. Ice deposits 2-200 \mu m thick are observed during the day on pole facing slopes in local fall, winter and early spring. Ice extends down to 13{\deg} latitude in the Southern Hemisphere but is restricted to latitudes higher than 32{\deg} in the north. On a given slope, the pattern of ice observations at the surface is mainly controlled by the global variability of atmospheric water (precipitation and vapor), with local ground properties playing a lower role. Only seasonal surface ice is observed: no exposed patches of perennial ground ice have been detected. Surface seasonal ice is however sensitive to subsurface properties: the results presented in this study are consistent with the recent discovery of low latitude subsurface ice obtained through the analysis of CO2 frost. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Among these tests the perihelion shifts give the tightest constraints and indicate that the Pioneer anomaly cannot be caused by a universal solar system Rindler acceleration. We address potential caveats for massive test-objects. Our tightest bound on Rindler acceleration that comes with no caveats is derived from radar echo delay and yields |a|<3nm/s^2. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)"

Ansty,  Andrei Mamoutkine,  Sandrine Vinatier,  Gordon L. Bjoraker,  Donald E. Jennings,  Paul. N. Romani,  F. Michael Flasar;  In this paper we describe a first quantitative search for several molecules in Titan's stratosphere in Cassini CIRS infrared spectra. These are: ammonia (NH3), methanol (CH3OH), formaldehyde (H2CO), and acetonitrile (CH3CN), all of which are predicted by photochemical models but only the last of which observed, and not in the infrared. We find non-detections in all cases, but derive upper limits on the abundances from low-noise observations at 25{\deg}S and 75{\deg}N. Comparing these constraints to model predictions, we conclude that CIRS is highly unlikely to see NH3 or CH3OH emissions. However, CH3CN and H2CO are closer to CIRS detectability, and we suggest ways in which the sensitivity threshold may be lowered towards this goal. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.0330;Cavities as a source of outbursts from comets; Sergei I. Ipatov;  Analysis of observations of natural and triggered outbursts from different comets testifies in favor of existence of large cavities with material under gas pressure below a considerable fraction of a comet's surface. Based on analysis of images of the cloud of material ejected from Comet 9P/Tempel 1 after the collision of the Deep Impact (DI) module with the comet, we studied the time variations in the rate and velocities of ejection of observed particles (mainly icy particles with diameter d<3 micron). Comparison of these dependencies with the theoretical dependencies allowed us to understand the time variations in the rate of the outburst triggered by the impact. The latter variations testify in favor of that there were cavities at the place of DI ejection. The beginning of the increase of the main outburst at 8 s after the DI impact could be caused by excavation of a relatively large cavity that contained dust and gas under pressure. The upper boarder of the cavity could be located at about 5-10 meters below the surface of the comet. This cavity could be deep because the excavation from the cavity could last for at least a few tens of seconds. With the increase of the crater, more cavities could be excavated. The outburst decreased at ~60 s after the impact. Besides the 'fast' outburst caused by ejection from cavities, there was a 'slow' outburst ejection, which was similar to the ejection from a 'fresh' surface of a comet and could be noticeable during 30-60 min. The 'fast' outburst with velocities ~100 m/s probably could continue for at least several tens of seconds, and it could significantly increase the fraction of particles ejected with velocities ~100 m/s compared with theoretical models of ejection. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.0379;Near-tropical subsurface ice on Mars; Mathieu Vincendon,  John Mustard,  FranÃ§ois Forget,  Mikhail Kreslavsky,  Aymeric Spiga,  Scott Murchie,  Jean-Pierre Bibring;  Near-surface perennial water ice on Mars has been previously inferred down to latitudes of about 45{\deg} and could result from either water vapor diffusion through the regolith under current conditions or previous ice ages precipitations. In this paper we show that at latitudes as low as 25{\deg} in the southern hemisphere buried water ice in the shallow (< 1 m) subsurface is required to explain the observed surface distribution of seasonal CO2 frost on pole facing slopes. This result shows that possible remnants of the last ice age, as well as water that will be needed for the future exploration of Mars, are accessible significantly closer to the equator than previously thought, where mild conditions for both robotic and human exploration lie. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.0384;Recovery of surface reflectance spectra and evaluation of the optical  depth of aerosols in the near-IR using a Monte-Carlo approach: Application to  the OMEGA observations of high latitude regions of Mars; Mathieu Vincendon,  Yves Langevin,  FranÃ§ois Poulet,  Jean-Pierre Bibring,  Brigitte Gondet;  We present a model of radiative transfer through atmospheric particles based on Monte Carlo methods. This model can be used to analyze and remove the contribution of aerosols in remote sensing observations. We have developed a method to quantify the contribution of atmospheric dust in near-IR spectra of the Martian surface obtained by the OMEGA imaging spectrometer on board Mars Express. Using observations in the nadir pointing mode with significant differences in solar incidence angles, we can infer the optical depth of atmospheric dust, and we can retrieve the surface reflectance spectra free of aerosol contribution. Martian airborne dust properties are discussed and constrained from previous studies and OMEGA data. We have tested our method on a region at 90{\deg}E and 77{\deg}N extensively covered by OMEGA, where significant variations of the albedo of ice patches in the visible have been reported. The consistency between reflectance spectra of ice-covered and ice-free regions recovered at different incidence angles validates our approach. The optical depth of aerosols varies by a factor 3 in this region during the summer of Martian year 27. The observed brightening of ice patches does not result from frost deposition but from a decrease in the dust contamination of surface ice and (to a lower extent) from a decrease in the optical thickness of atmospheric dust. Our Monte Carlo-based model can be applied to recover the spectral reflectance characteristics of the surface from OMEGA spectral imaging data when the optical thickness of aerosols can be evaluated. It could prove useful for processing image cubes from the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

The observations of the new object were confirmed with 60-cm reflector of Schiaparelli observatory (Italy) and 35-cm Schmidt - Cassegrain telescope of Alter Saltzberg observatory (Vienna, Austria). The asteroid was attributed as potentially hazardous near Earth asteroid. The minimal orbit intersection distance is 0.0304 a.e.

The observations were made in the framework of NEOs investigation program. The following tasks were established for the investigation: to get astrometric and photometric (in BVRI bands) series of observations, to improve the asteroid orbit on the base of the observational data, to determine its taxonomic class and absolute magnitude, to investigate the dynamics of its rotation, to estimate its physical parameters.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.0427;The Physics of Protoplanetesimal Dust Agglomerates. Vi. Erosion of Large  Aggregates as a Source of Micrometer-Sized Particles; Rainer SchrÃ¤pler,  JÃ¼rgen Blum;  Observed protoplanetary disks consist of a large amount of micrometer-sized particles. Dullemond and Dominik (2005) pointed out for the first time the difficulty in explaining the strong mid-IR excess of classical T-Tauri stars without any dust-retention mechanisms. Because high relative velocities in between micrometer-sized and macroscopic particles exist in protoplanetary disks, we present experimental results on the erosion of macroscopic agglomerates consisting of micrometer-sized spherical particles via the impact of micrometer-sized particles. We find that after an initial phase, in which an impacting particle erodes up to 10 particles of an agglomerate, the impacting particles compress the agglomerate's surface, which partly passivates the agglomerates against erosion. Due to this effect the erosion halts within our error bars for impact velocities up to ~30 m/s. For larger velocities, the erosion is reduced by an order of magnitude. This outcome is explained and confirmed by a numerical model. In a next step we build an analytical disk model and implement the experimentally found erosive effect. The model shows that erosion is a strong source of micrometer-sized particles in a protoplanetary disk. Finally we use the stationary solution of this model to explain the amount of micrometer-sized particles in observational infrared data of Furlan et al. (2006). ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Kelley,  David E. Harker,  Michael L. Sitko;  We report optical imaging, optical and near-infrared polarimetry, and Spitzer mid-infrared spectroscopy of comet C/2007 N3 (Lulin). Polarimetric observations were obtained in R (0.676 micron) at phase angles from 0.44 degrees to 21 degrees with simultaneous observations in H (1.65 micron) at 4.0 degrees, exploring the negative branch in polarization. Comet C/2007 N3 (Lulin) shows typical negative polarization in the optical as well as a similar negative branch near-infrared wavelengths. The 10 micron silicate feature is only weakly in emission and according to our thermal models, is consistent with emission from a mixture of silicate and carbon material. We argue that large, low-porosity (akin to Ballistic Particle Cluster Aggregates) rather absorbing aggregate dust particles best explain both the polarimetric and the mid-infrared spectral energy distribution. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.0724;Albedos of Small Hilda Group Asteroids as Revealed by Spitzer; Erin Lee Ryan,  Charles E. Woodward;"  We present thermal 24 $\mu$m observations from the \textit{Spitzer Space Telescope} of 62 Hilda asteroid group members with diameters ranging from 3 to 12 kilometers. Measurements of the thermal emission when combined with reported absolute magnitudes allow us to constrain the albedo and diameter of each object. From our \textit{Spitzer} sample, we find the mean geometric albedo, $p_{V} =$ 0.07 $\pm$ 0.05 for small (D $<$ 10 km) Hilda group asteroids. This value of $p_{V}$ is greater than and spans a larger range in albedo space than the mean albedo of large (D $\gtrsim$ 10 km) Hilda group asteroids which is $p_{V} =$ 0.04 $\pm$ 0.01. Though this difference may be attributed to space weathering, the small Hilda group population reportedly displays greater taxonomic range from C-, D- and X-type whose albedo distributions are commensurate with the range of determined albedos. We discuss the derived Hilda size-frequency distribution, color-color space, and geometric albedo for our survey sample in the context of the expected migration induced ""seeding"" of the Hilda asteroid group with outer solar system proto-planetesimals as outlined in the ""Nice"" formalism.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.0775;The Impact of the Convective Blueshift Effect on Spectroscopic Planetary  Transits; Avi Shporer,  Tim Brown (LCOGT/UCSB);  We present here a small anomalous radial velocity (RV) signal expected to be present in RV curves measured during planetary transits. This signal is induced by the convective blueshift (CB) effect --- a net blueshift emanating from the stellar surface, resulting from a larger contribution of rising hot and bright gas relative to the colder and darker sinking gas. Since the CB radial component varies across the stellar surface, the light blocked by the planet during a transit will have a varying RV component, resulting in a small shift of the measured RVs. The CB-induced anomalous RV curve is different than, and independent of, the well known Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect, where the latter is used for determining the sky-projected angle between the host star rotation axis and the planet's orbital angular momentum axis. The observed RV curve is the sum of the CB and RM signals, and they are both superposed on the orbital Keplerian curve. If not accounted for, the presence of the CB RV signal in the spectroscopic transit RV curve may bias the estimate of the spin-orbit angle. In addition, future very high precision RVs will allow the use of transiting planets to study the CB of their host stars. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Observations at different solar zenith angles and one EPF sequence demonstrate that the reflectance in the 2.64 {\mu}m saturated absorption band of the surface CO2 ice is mainly due to the light scattered by aerosols above most places of the seasonal cap. We have mapped the total optical depth of dust aerosols in the near-IR above the south seasonal cap of Mars from mid-spring to early summer with a time resolution ranging from one day to one week and a spatial resolution of a few kilometers. The optical depth above the south perennial cap is determined on a longer time range covering southern spring and summer. A constant set of optical properties of dust aerosols is consistent with OMEGA observations during the analyzed period. Strong variations of the optical depth are observed over small horizontal and temporal scales, corresponding in part to moving dust clouds. The late summer peak in dust opacity observed by Opportunity in 2005 propagated to the south pole contrarily to that observed in mid spring. This may be linked to evidence for dust scavenging by water ice-rich clouds circulating at high southern latitudes at this season. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.1084;La2010: A new orbital solution for the long term motion of the Earth; J. Laskar,  A. Fienga,  M. Gastineau,  H. Manche;  We present here a new solution for the astronomical computation of the orbital motion of the Earth spanning from 0 to -250 Myr. The main improvement with respect to the previous numerical solution La2004 (Laskar et al. 2004) is an improved adjustment of the parameters and initial conditions through a fit over 1 Myr to a special version of the high accurate numerical ephemeris INPOP08 (Fienga et al. 2009). The precession equations have also been entirely revised and are no longer averaged over the orbital motion of the Earth and Moon. This new orbital solution is now valid over more than 50 Myr in the past or in the future with proper phases of the eccentricity variations. Due to chaotic behavior, the precision of the solution decreases rapidly beyond this time span, and we discuss the behavior of various solutions beyond 50 Myr. For paleoclimate calibrations, we provide several different solutions that are all compatible with the most precise planetary ephemeris. We have thus reached the time where geological data are now required to discriminate among planetary orbital solutions beyond 50 Myr. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.1199;Quantization of Planetary Systems and its Dependency on Stellar Rotation; Jean-Paul Zoghbi;  With the discovery of now more than 500 exoplanets, we present a statistical analysis of the planetary orbital periods and their relationship to the rotation periods of their parent stars. We test whether the structure of planetary orbits, i.e. planetary angular momentum and orbital periods are 'quantized' in integer or half-integer multiples with respect to the parent stars' rotation period. The Solar System is first shown to exhibit quantized planetary orbits that correlate with the Sun's rotation period. The analysis is then expanded over 443 exoplanets to statistically validate this quantization and its association with stellar rotation. The results imply that the exoplanetary orbital periods are highly correlated with the parent star's rotation periods and follow a discrete half-integer relationship with orbital ranks n=0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, etc. The probability of obtaining these results by pure chance is p<0.024. We discuss various mechanisms that could justify this planetary quantization, such as the hybrid gravitational instability models of planet formation, along with possible physical mechanisms such as inner discs magnetospheric truncation, tidal dissipation, and resonance trapping. In conclusion, we statistically demonstrate that a quantized orbital structure should emerge naturally from the formation processes of planetary systems and that this orbital quantization is highly dependent on the parent stars rotation periods. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.1263;Predictions on the core mass of Jupiter and of giant planets in general; Nadine Nettelmann;  More than 80 giant planets are known by mass and radius. Their interior structure in terms of core mass, number of layers, and composition however is still poorly known. An overview is presented about the core mass Mcore and envelope mass of metals MZ in Jupiter as predicted by various equations of state. It is argued that the uncertainty about the true H/He EOS in a pressure regime where the gravitational moments J2 and J4 are most sensitive, i.e. between 0.5 and 4 Mbar, is in part responsible for the broad range Mcore=0-18 Mearth, MZ=0-38 Mearth, and Mcore+MZ=14-38 Mearth currently offered for Jupiter. We then compare the Jupiter models obtained when we only match J2 with the range of solutions for the exoplanet GJ436b, when we match an assumed tidal Love number k2 value. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

The transiting exoplanet XO-5 b was found to have an anomalously high Safronov number and surface gravity. Our aim was to refine parameters of this intriguing system and search for signs of transit timing variations. We gathered high-precision light curves of two transits of XO-5 b. Assuming three different limb darkening laws, we found the best-fitting model and redetermined parameters of the system, including planet-to-star radius ratio, impact parameter and central time of transits. Error estimates were derived by the prayer bead method and Monte Carlo simulations. Although system's parameters obtained by us were found to agree with previous studies within one sigma, the planet was found to be notable smaller with the radius of 1.03+0.06-0.05 Jupiter radii. Our results confirm the high Safronov number and surface gravity of the planet. With two new mid-transit times, the ephemeris was refined to BJD(TDB)=(2454485.66842 \pm 0.00028) + (4.1877537 \pm 0.000017) E. No significant transit timing variation was detected. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.1376;Symplectic integrators in the shearing sheet; Hanno Rein,  Scott Tremaine;"  The shearing sheet is a model dynamical system that is used to study the small-scale dynamics of astrophysical disks. Numerical simulations of particle trajectories in the shearing sheet usually employ the leapfrog integrator, but this integrator performs poorly because of velocity-dependent (Coriolis) forces. We describe two new integrators for this purpose; both are symplectic, time-reversible and second-order accurate, and can easily be generalized to higher orders. Moreover, both integrators are exact when there are no small-scale forces such as mutual gravitational forces between disk particles. In numerical experiments these integrators have errors that are often several orders of magnitude smaller than competing methods. The first of our new integrators (SEI) is well-suited for disks in which the typical inter-particle separation is large compared to the particles' Hill radii (e.g., planetary rings), and the second (SEKI) is designed for disks in which the particles are on bound orbits or the separation is smaller than the Hill radius (e.g., irregular satellites of the giant planets).

https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.1380;Effect of Ambipolar Diffusion on the Non-linear Evolution of  Magnetorotational Instability in Weakly Ionized Disks; Xue-Ning Bai,  James M. Stone (Princeton);  We study the role of ambipolar diffusion (AD) on the non-linear evolution of the MRI in protoplanetary disks using the strong coupling limit, which applies when the electron recombination time is much shorter than the orbital time. The effect of AD in this limit is characterized by the dimensionless number Am, the frequency of which neutral particles collide with ions normalized to the orbital frequency. We perform three-dimensional unstratified shearing-box simulations of the MRI over a wide range of Am as well as different magnetic field strengths and geometries. The saturation level of the MRI turbulence depends on the magnetic geometry and increases with the net magnetic flux. There is an upper limit to the net flux for sustained turbulence, corresponding to the requirement that the most unstable vertical wavelength be less than the disk scale height. Correspondingly, at a given Am, there exists a maximum value of the turbulent stress alpha_max. For Am<1, the largest stress is associated with a field geometry that has both net vertical and toroidal flux. In this case, we confirm the results of linear analyses that show the fastest growing mode has a non-zero radial wave number with growth rate exceeding the pure vertical field case. We find there is a very tight correlation between the turbulent stress (alpha) and the plasma beta=P_gas/P_mag~1/(2alpha) at the saturated state of the MRI turbulence regardless of field geometry, and alpha_max rapidly decreases with decreasing Am. In particular, we quote alpha_max~0.007 for Am=1 and alpha_max~0.0006 for Am=0.1. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.1443;The Occurrence Rate of Earth Analog Planets Orbiting Sunlike Stars; Joseph Catanzarite,  Michael Shao (Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology);"  Kepler is a space telescope that searches Sun-like stars for planets. Its major goal is to determine {\eta}_Earth, the fraction of Sunlike stars that have planets like Earth. When a planet 'transits' or moves in front of a star, Kepler can measure the concomitant dimming of the starlight. From analysis of the first four months of those measurements for over 150,000 stars, Kepler's science team has determined sizes, surface temperatures, orbit sizes and periods for over a thousand new planet candidates. In this paper, we characterize the period probability distribution function of the super-Earth and Neptune planet candidates with periods up to 132 days, and find three distinct period regimes. For candidates with periods below 3 days the density increases sharply with increasing period; for periods between 3 and 30 days the density rises more gradually with increasing period, and for periods longer than 30 days, the density drops gradually with increasing period. We estimate that 1% to 3% of stars like the Sun are expected to have Earth analog planets, based on the Kepler data release of Feb 2011. This estimate of is based on extrapolation from a fiducial subsample of the Kepler planet candidates that we chose to be nominally 'complete' (i.e., no missed detections) to the realm of the Earth-like planets, by means of simple power law models. The accuracy of the extrapolation will improve as more data from the Kepler mission is folded in. Accurate knowledge of {\eta}_Earth is essential for the planning of future missions that will image and take spectra of Earthlike planets. Our result that Earths are relatively scarce means that a substantial effort will be needed to identify suitable target stars prior to these future missions.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.1629;Wind-shearing in gaseous protoplanetary disks and the evolution of  binary planetesimals; Hagai B. Perets,  Ruth A. Murray-Clay;  One of the first stages of planet formation is the growth of small planetesimals. This early stage occurs much before the dispersal of most of the gas from the protoplanetary disk. Due to their different aerodynamic properties, planetesimals of different sizes and shapes experience different drag forces from the gas during this time. Such differential forces produce a wind-shearing (WISH) effect between close by, different size planetesimals. For any two planetesimals, a WISH radius can be considered, at which the differential acceleration due to the wind becomes greater than the mutual gravitational pull between the planetesimals. We find that the WISH radius could be much smaller than the Hill radius, i.e. WISH could play a more important role than tidal perturbations by the star. Here we study the WISH radii for planetesimal pairs of different sizes and compare the effects of wind and gravitational shearing (drag force vs. gravitational tidal force). We then discuss the role of WISH for the stability and survival of binary planetesimals. Binaries are sheared apart by the wind if they are wider than their WISH radius. WISH-stable binaries can inspiral and possibly coalesce due to gas drag. Here, we calculate the WISH radius and the gas drag-induced merger timescale, providing stability and survival criteria for gas-embedded binary planetesimals. Our results suggest that even WISH-stable binaries may merge in times shorter than the lifetime of the gaseous disk. This may constrain currently observed binary planetesimals to have formed far from the star or at a late stage after the dispersal of most of the disk gas. We note that the WISH radius may also be important for other processes such as planetesimal erosion and planetesimal encounters and collisions in a gaseous environment. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.1846;Hot Super Earths: disrupted young jupiters?; Sergei Nayakshin;"  Recent {\em Kepler} observations revealed an unexpected abundance of ""hot"" Earth-size to Neptune-size planets in the inner $0.02-0.2$ AU from their parent stars. We propose that these smaller planets are the remnants of massive giant planets that migrated inward quicker than they could contract. We show that such disruptions naturally occur in the framework of the Tidal Downsizing hypothesis for planet formation. We find that the characteristic planet-star separation at which such ""hot disruptions"" occur is $R \approx 0.03-0.2$ AU. This result is independent of the planet's embryo mass but is dependent on the accretion rate in the disc. At high accretion rates, $\dot M \simgt 10^{-6}\msun$ yr$^{-1}$, the embryo is unable to contract quickly enough and is disrupted. At late times, when the accretion rate drops to $\dot M \simlt 10^{-8} \msun$ yr$^{-1}$, the embryos migrate sufficiently slow to not be disrupted. These ""late arrivals"" may explain the well known population of hot jupiters. If type I migration regime is inefficient, then our model predicts a pile-up of planets at $R\sim 0.1$ AU as the migration rate suddenly switches from the type II to type I in that region.

Close,  LÃ¡szlÃ³ SzÅ±cs,  DÃ¡niel Apai,  Ilaria Pascucci,  Beth A. Biller;"  (Abridged) Since the discovery of the first directly-imaged, planetary-mass object, 2MASS 1207 b, several works have sought to explain a disparity between its observed temperature and luminosity. Given its known age, distance, and spectral type, 2MASS 1207 b is under-luminous by a factor of ~10 (~2.5 mags) when compared to standard models of brown-dwarf/giant-planet evolution. In this paper, we study three possible sources of 2MASS 1207 b's under-luminosity. First, we investigate Mohanty et al. (2007)'s hypothesis that a near edge-on disk might be responsible for 2MASS 1207 b's under-luminosity. We conclude that the hypothesis is unlikely due to the lack of variability seen in multi-epoch photometry and unnecessary due to the increasing sample of under-luminous brown-dwarfs/giant-exoplanets that cannot be explained by an edge-on disk. Next, we test the analogous possibility that a spherical shell of dust, could explain 2MASS 1207 b's under-luminosity. Models containing enough dust to create ~2.5 mags of extinction, placed at reasonable radii, are ruled out by our new Gemini/T-ReCS 8.7 micron photometric upper-limit for 2MASS 1207 b. Finally, we investigate the possibility that 2MASS 1207 b is intrinsically cooler than the commonly used AMES-DUSTY fits to its spectrum, and thus it is not, in fact, under-luminous. New, thick cloud model grids by Madhusudhan et al. (2011) fit 2MASS 1207 b's 1-10 micron SED well, but they do not quite fit its near-infrared spectrum. However, we suggest that with some ""tuning"", they might be capable of simultaneously reproducing 2MASS 1207 b's spectral shape and luminosity. In this case, the whole class of young, under-luminous brown-dwarfs/giant-exoplanets might be explained by atmospheres that are able to suspend thick, dusty clouds in their photospheres at lower temperatures than field brown-dwarfs.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.2081;Determining Eccentricities of Transiting Planets: A Divide in the  Mass-Period Plane; Frederic Pont,  Nawal Husnoo,  Tsevi Mazeh,  Daniel Fabrycky;"  The two dominant features in the distribution of orbital parameters for close-in exoplanets are the prevalence of circular orbits for very short periods, and the observation that planets on closer orbits tend to be heavier. The first feature is interpreted as a signature of tidal evolution, while the origin of the second, a ""mass-period relation"" for hot Jupiters, is not understood. In this paper we re-consider the ensemble properties of transiting exoplanets with well-measured parameters, focussing on orbital eccentricity and the mass-period relation. We recalculate the constraints on eccentricity in a homogeneous way, using new radial-velocity data, with particular attention to statistical biases. We find that planets on circular orbits gather in a well-defined region of the mass-period plane, close to the minimum period for any given mass. Exceptions to this pattern reported in the Literature can be attributed to statistical biases. The ensemble data is compatible with classical tide theory with orbital circularisation caused by tides raised on the planet, and suggest that tidal circularisation and the stopping mechanisms for close-in planets are closely related to each other. The position mass-period relation is compatible with a relation between a planet's Hill radius and its present orbit. ";Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Both optical and infrared colors are available for 32 objects that overlap between the datasets. This dataset adds an especially uniform, consistent and large contribution to the overall sample of colors, particularly in the infrared. The range of our measured colors is consistent with other colors reported in the literature at both optical and infrared wavelengths. We find generally good agreement for objects measured by both us and others; 88.1% have better than 2 sigma agreement. The median Hv magnitude of our optical sample is 7.2, modestly smaller (~0.5 mag) than for previous samples. The median absolute magnitude, Hv, in our infrared sample is 6.7.

Berta,  David Charbonneau,  Jonathan Irwin,  Jonathan J. Fortney,  Christopher J. Burke,  Philip Nutzman;  We report observations of two consecutive transits of the warm super-Earth exoplanet GJ1214b at 3.6 and 4.5 microns with the Infrared Array Camera instrument on-board the Spitzer Space Telescope. The two transit light curves allow for the determination of the transit parameters for this system. We find these paremeters to be consistent with the previously determined values and no evidence for transit timing variations. The main investigation consists of measuring the transit depths in each bandpass to constrain the planet's transmission spectrum. Fixing the system scale and impact parameters, we measure R_p/R_star=0.1176 (+0.0008/-0.0009) and 0.1163 (+0.0010/-0.0008) at 3.6 and 4.5 microns, respectively. Combining these data with the previously reported MEarth Observatory measurements in the red optical yields constraints on the GJ1214b's transmission spectrum and allows us to rule-out a cloud-free, solar composition (i.e., hydrogen-dominated) atmosphere at 4.5 sigma confidence. This independently confirms a recent finding that was based on a measurement of the planet's transmission spectrum using the VLT. The Spitzer, MEarth, and VLT observations together yield a remarkably flat transmission spectrum over the large wavelength domain spanned by the data. Consequently, cloud-free atmospheric models require more than 30% metals (assumed to be in the form of H2O by volume to be consistent with all the observations. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

This method uses four collecting telescopes, combined with phase chopping and a spectrometer, with observations on only a few baselines rather than on a continuously rotated baseline. Focusing on the contiguous wavelength spectra of typical exoplanets, the (u, v) plane can be simultaneously and uniformly filled by recording the spectrally resolved signal. This concept allows us to perfectly remove speckles from reconstructed images. For a target comprising a star and multiple planets, observations on three baselines are sufficient to extract the position and spectrum of each planet. Our simulations show that this new method allows us to detect an analog Earth around a Sun-like star at 10 pc and to acquire its spectrum over the wavelength range from 8 to 19 {\mu}m with a high spectral resolution of 100. This method allows us to fully characterize an analog Earth and to similarly characterize each planet in multi-planet systems. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

";"  We report the distribution of planets as a function of planet radius (R_p), orbital period (P), and stellar effective temperature (Teff) for P < 50 day orbits around GK stars. These results are based on the 1,235 planets (formally ""planet candidates"") from the Kepler mission that include a nearly complete set of detected planets as small as 2 Earth radii (Re). For each of the 156,000 target stars we assess the detectability of planets as a function of R_p and P. We also correct for the geometric probability of transit, R*/a. We consider first stars within the ""solar subset"" having Teff = 4100-6100 K, logg = 4.0-4.9, and Kepler magnitude Kp < 15 mag. We include only those stars having noise low enough to permit detection of planets down to 2 Re. We count planets in small domains of R_p and P and divide by the included target stars to calculate planet occurrence in each domain. Occurrence of planets varies by more than three orders of magnitude and increases substantially down to the smallest radius (2 Re) and out to the longest orbital period (50 days, ~0.25 AU) in our study. For P < 50 days, the radius distribution is given by a power law, df/dlogR= k R^\alpha. This rapid increase in planet occurrence with decreasing planet size agrees with core-accretion, but disagrees with population synthesis models. We fit occurrence as a function of P to a power law model with an exponential cutoff below a critical period P_0. For smaller planets, P_0 has larger values, suggesting that the ""parking distance"" for migrating planets moves outward with decreasing planet size. We also measured planet occurrence over Teff = 3600-7100 K, spanning M0 to F2 dwarfs. The occurrence of 2-4 Re planets in the Kepler field increases with decreasing Teff, making these small planets seven times more abundant around cool stars than the hottest stars in our sample.

Guo;  A multi-fluid model for an atomic hydrogen-proton mixture in the upper atmosphere of extrosolar planet is presented when the continuity and momentum equations of each component have been already solved with an energy equation. The particle number density, the temperature distribution and the structure of velocity can be found by means of the model. We chose two special objects, HD 209458b and HD 189733b, as discussion samples and the conclusion is that their mass loss rates predicted by the model are in accordance with those of observation. The most important physical process in coupling each component is charge exchange which tightly couples atomic hydrogen with protons. Most of the hydrogen escaping from hot Jupiters is protons, especially in young star-planet system. We found that the single-fluid model can describe the escape of particles when the mass loss rate is higher than a few times $10^{9}$ g/s while below $10^{9}$ g/s the multi-fluid model is more suitable for it due to the decoupling of particles. We found that the predicted mass loss rates of HD 189733b with the assumption of energy-limit are a factor of 10 larger than that calculated by our models due to the high ionization degree. For the ionized wind which is almost compose of protons, the assumption of energy-limit is no longer effective. We fitted the mass loss rates of the ionized wind as a function of $F_{UV}$ by calculating the variation of the mass loss rates with UV fluxes. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

It has been found by the WASP-south transit survey and confirmed photometrically and spectroscopically by the 1.2m Swiss Euler telescope, LCOGT 2m Faulkes South Telescope, the 60 cm TRAPPIST telescope and the ESO 3.6m telescope. The orbital period of the planet is 2.94 days. We find it is a gas giant with a mass of 0.88 \pm 0.10 Mj and a radius estimated at 0.96 \pm 0.05 Rj . We have also obtained spectra during transit with the HARPS spectrograph and detect the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect despite its small amplitude. Because of the low signal to noise of the effect and of a small impact parameter we cannot place a constraint on the projected spin-orbit angle. We find two confiicting values for the stellar rotation. Our determination, via spectral line broadening gives v sin I = 2.2 \pm 0.3 km/s, while another method, based on the activity level using the index log R'HK, gives an equatorial rotation velocity of only v = 1.35 \pm 0.20 km/s. Using these as priors in our analysis, the planet could either be misaligned or aligned. This should send strong warnings regarding the use of such priors. There is no evidence for eccentricity nor of any radial velocity drift with time. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)"

Combining the five new orbit solutions with 17 previously known orbits yields a sample of 22 mutual orbits for which the period P, semimajor axis a, and eccentricity e have been determined. These orbits have mutual periods ranging from 5 to over 800 days, semimajor axes ranging from 1,600 to 37,000 km, eccentricities ranging from 0 to 0.8, and system masses ranging from 2 x 10^17 to 2 x 10^22 kg. Based on the relative brightnesses of primaries and secondaries, most of these systems consist of near equal-sized pairs, although a few of the most massive systems are more lopsided. The observed distribution of orbital properties suggests that the most loosely-bound transneptunian binary systems are only found on dynamically cold heliocentric orbits. Of the 22 known binary mutual or-bits, orientation ambiguities are now resolved for 9, of which 7 are prograde and 2 are retro-grade, consistent with a random distribution of orbital orientations, but not with models predicting a strong preference for retrograde orbits. To the extent that other perturbations are not dominant, the binary systems undergo Kozai oscillations of their eccentricities and inclinations with periods of the order of tens of thousands to millions of years, some with strikingly high amplitudes. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.2791;Transit surveys for Earths in the habitable zones of white dwarfs; Eric Agol (University of Washington);  To date the search for habitable Earth-like planets has primarily focused on nuclear burning stars. I propose that this search should be expanded to cool white dwarf stars that have expended their nuclear fuel. I define the continuously habitable zone of white dwarfs, and show that it extends from ~0.005 to 0.02 AU for white dwarfs with masses from 0.4 to 0.9 solar masses, temperatures less than 10,000 K, and habitable durations of at least 3 Gyr. As they are similar in size to Earth, white dwarfs may be deeply eclipsed by terrestrial planets that orbit edge-on, which can easily be detected with ground-based telescopes. If planets can migrate inward or reform near white dwarfs, I show that a global robotic telescope network could carry out a transit survey of nearby white dwarfs placing interesting constraints on the presence of habitable Earths. If planets were detected, I show that the survey would favor detection of planets similar to Earth: similar size, temperature, rotation period, and host star temperatures similar to the Sun. The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope could place even tighter constraints on the frequency of habitable Earths around white dwarfs. The confirmation and characterization of these planets might be carried out with large ground and space telescopes. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.2794;Tidal Evolution of a Secularly Interacting Planetary System; Richard Greenberg,  Christa Van Laerhoven;  In a multi-planet system, a gradual change in one planet's semi-major axis will affect the eccentricities of all the planets, as angular momentum is distributed via secular interactions. If tidal dissipation in the planet is the cause of the change in semi-major axis, it also damps that planet's eccentricity, which in turn also contributes to the evolution of all the eccentricities. Formulae quantifying the combined effects on the whole system due to semi-major axis changes, as well as eccentricity damping, are derived here for a two-planet system. The CoRoT 7 system is considered as an example. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)"

Mohanty;  Gl581d has a minimum mass of 7 MEarth and is the first detected potentially habitable rocky Super-Earth. Our models confirm that a habitable atmosphere can exist on Gl581d. We derive spectroscopic features for atmospheres, assuming an Earth-like composition for this planet, from high oxygen atmosphere analogous to Earth's to high CO2 atmospheres with and without biotic oxygen concentrations. We find that a minimum CO2 partial pressure of about 7 bar, in an atmosphere with a total surface pressure of 7.6 bar, are needed to maintain a mean surface temperature above freezing on Gl581d. We model transmission and emergent synthetic spectra from 0.4{\mu}m to 40{\mu}m and show where indicators of biological activities in such a planet's atmosphere could be observed by future ground- and space-based telescopes. The model we present here only represents one possible nature - an Earth-like composition - of a planet like Gl581d in a wide parameter space. Future observations of atmospheric features can be used to examine if our concept of habitability and its dependence on the carbonate-silicate cycle is correct, and assess whether Gl581d is indeed a habitable super-Earth. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.3000;The structure and dynamics of molecular gas in planet-forming zones: A  CRIRES spectro-astrometric survey; Klaus M. Pontoppidan,  Geoffrey A. Blake,  Alain Smette;  We present a spectro-astrometric survey of molecular gas in the inner regions of 16 protoplanetary disks using CRIRES, the high resolution infrared imaging spectrometer on the Very Large Telescope. Spectro-astrometry with CRIRES measures the spatial extent of line emission to sub-milliarcsecond precision, or <0.2 AU at the distance of the observed targets. The sample consists of gas-rich disks surrounding stars with spectral types ranging from K to A. The properties of the spectro-astrometric signals divide the sources into two distinct phenomenological classes: one that shows clear Keplerian astrometric spectra, and one in which the astrometric signatures are dominated by gas with strong non-Keplerian (radial) motions. Similarly to the near-infrared continuum emission, as determined by interferometry, we find that the size of the CO line emitting region in the Keplerian sources obeys a size-luminosity relation as $R_CO L_*^0.5. The non-Keplerian spectro-astrometric signatures are likely indicative of the presence of wide-angle disk winds. The central feature of the winds is a strong sub-Keplerian velocity field due to conservation of angular momentum as the wind pressure drives the gas outwards. We construct a parametrized 2-dimensional disk+wind model that reproduces the observed characteristics the observed CO spectra and astrometry. The modeled winds indicate mass-loss rates of >10^-10 to 10^-8 Msol/yr. We suggest a unifying model in which all disks have slow molecular winds, but where the magnitude of the mass-loss rate determines the degree to which the mid-infrared molecular lines are dominated by the wind relative to the Keplerian disk surface. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

The main objective of this work is to obtain the inclination of the orbit, the mass of the exoplanet, and the planet-to-star flux ratio. We present the results of our routines on the planetary system HD 217107, which was observed with the high-resolution spectrograph Phoenix at 2.14 microns. We revisited and tuned a correlation method to directly search for the high-resolution signature of a known non-transiting extrasolar planet. We could not detect the planet with our current data, but we present sensitivity estimates of our method and the respective constraints on the planetary parameters. With a confidence level of 3--$\sigma$ we constrain the HD 217107 b planet-to-star flux ratio to be less than $5 \times 10^{-3}$. We also carried out simulations on other planet candidates to assess the detectability limit of atmospheric water on realistically simulated data sets for this instrument, and we outline an optimized observational and selection strategy to increase future probabilities of success by considering the optimal observing conditions and the most suitable candidates. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

TrES-4b and WASP-12b were confirmed to be ""bloated"" planets, with radii of 1.706 +/- 0.056 R_Jup and 1.736 +/- 0.092 R_Jup, respectively. These planets are too large to be explained with standard models of gas giant planets. In contrast, HAT-P-3b has a radius of 0.827 +/- 0.055 R_Jup, smaller than a pure hydrogen-helium planet and indicative of a highly metal-enriched composition. Analyses of the transit timings revealed no significant departures from strict periodicity. For TrES-4, our relatively recent observations allow for improvement in the orbital ephemerides, which is useful for planning future observations. ";Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.3101;Equatorial superrotation on tidally locked exoplanets; Adam P. Showman,  Lorenzo M. Polvani;"  The increasing richness of exoplanet observations has motivated a variety of three-dimensional atmospheric circulation models of these planets. Under strongly irradiated conditions, models of tidally locked, short-period planets (both hot Jupiters and terrestrial planets) tend to exhibit a circulation dominated by a fast eastward, or ""superrotating,"" jet stream at the equator. Under appropriate conditions, this phenomenon can cause the hottest regions to be displaced eastward from the substellar point by tens of degrees longitude. Such an offset has been observed on HD 189733b, supporting the possibility of equatorial jets on short-period exoplanets. Despite its relevance, however, the dynamical mechanisms responsible for generating the equatorial superrotation in such models have not been identified. Here, we show that the equatorial jet results from the interaction of the mean flow with standing, planetary-scale Rossby and Kelvin waves induced by the day-night thermal forcing. The Rossby waves develop phase tilts that pump eastward momentum from high latitudes to the equator, thereby inducing equatorial superrotation. We present an analytic theory demonstrating this mechanism and explore its properties in a hierarchy of one-layer (shallow-water) calculations and fully 3D models. The wave-mean-flow interaction produces an equatorial jet whose latitudinal width is comparable to that of the Rossby waves, namely the equatorial Rossby deformation radius modified by radiative and frictional effects. For conditions typical of synchronously rotating hot Jupiters, this length is comparable to a planetary radius, explaining the broad scale of the equatorial jet obtained in most hot Jupiter models. Our theory illuminates the dependence of the equatorial jet speed on forcing amplitude, strength of friction, and other parameters, as well as the conditions under which jets can form at all.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.3209;Planetesimals in Debris Disks of Sun-like Stars; Andrew B. Shannon,  Yanqin Wu;  Observations of dusty debris disks can be used to test theories of planetesimal coagulation. Planetesimals of sizes up to a couple thousand kms are embedded in these disks and their mutual collisions generate the small dust grains that are observed. The dust luminosities, when combined with information on the dust spatial extent and the system age, can be used to infer initial masses in the planetesimal belts. Carrying out such a procedure for a sample of debris disks around Sun-like stars, we reach the following two conclusions. First, if we assume that colliding planetesimals satisfy a primordial size spectrum of the form dn/ds ~ s^{-q}, observed disks strongly favor a value of q between 3.5 and 4, while both current theoretical expectations and statistics of Kuiper belt objects favor a somewhat larger value. Second, number densities of planetesimals are two to three orders of magnitude higher in detected disks than in the Kuiper belt, for comparably-sized objects. This is a surprise for the coagulation models. It would require a similar increase in the solid surface density of the primordial disk over that of the Minimum Mass Solar Nebula, which is unreasonable. Both of our conclusions are driven by the need to explain the presence of bright debris disks at a few Gyrs of age. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)"

Here we present the algorithm and the first applications of a radiative transfer model in spherical geometry designed for planetary data analysis. We first describe a fast Monte-Carlo code that takes advantage of symmetries and geometric redundancies. We then apply this model to observations of the surface of Mars and Titan at the terminator as acquired by OMEGA/Mars Express and VIMS/Cassini. These observations are used to probe the vertical distribution of aerosols down to the surface. On Mars, we find the scale height of dust particles to vary between 6 km and 12 km depending on season. Temporal variations in the vertical size distribution of aerosols are also highlighted. On Titan, an aerosols scale height of 80 \pm 10 km is inferred, and the total optical depth is found to decrease with wavelength as a power-law with an exponent of -2.0 \pm 0.4 from a value of 2.3 \pm 0.5 at 1.08 {\mu}m. Once the aerosols properties have been constrained, the model is used to retrieve surface reflectance properties at high solar zenith angles and just after sunset. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.3268;Planetesimal and Protoplanet Dynamics in a Turbulent Protoplanetary  Disk: Ideal Stratified Disks; Chao-Chin Yang,  Mordecai-Mark Mac Low,  Kristen Menou;  Due to the gravitational influence of density fluctuations driven by magneto-rotational instability in the gas disk, planetesimals and protoplanets undergo diffusive radial migration as well as changes in other orbital properties. The magnitude of the effect on particle orbits can have important consequences for planet formation scenarios. We use the local-shearing-box approximation to simulate an ideal, isothermal, magnetized gas disk with vertical density stratification and simultaneously evolve numerous massless particles moving under the gravitational field of the gas and the host star. We measure the evolution of the particle orbital properties, including mean radius, eccentricity, inclination, and velocity dispersion, and its dependence on the disk properties and the particle initial conditions. Although the results converge with resolution for fixed box dimensions, we find the response of the particles to the gravity of the turbulent gas correlates with the horizontal box size, up to 16 disk scale heights. This correlation indicates that caution should be exercised when interpreting local-shearing-box models involving gravitational physics of magneto-rotational turbulence. Based on heuristic arguments, nevertheless, the criterion L_h / R ~ O(1), where L_h is the horizontal box size and R is the distance to the host star, is proposed to possibly circumvent this conundrum. If this criterion holds, we can still conclude that magneto-rotational turbulence seems likely to be ineffective at driving either diffusive migration or collisional erosion under most circumstances. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

The analyzed period covers two Mars years, spanning from early 2004 to early 2008 (includes the 2007 global dust event). Radiative transfer modeling indicates that the apparent albedo variations of low to mid-latitude dark regions are consistent with those produced by the varying optical depth of atmospheric dust as measured simultaneously from the ground by the Mars Exploration Rovers. We observe only a few significant albedo changes that can be attributed to surface phenomena. They are small-scaled and located at the boundaries between bright and dark regions. We then investigate the variations of the mean particle size of aerosols using the evolution of the observed dark region spectra between 1 and 2.5 {\mu}m. Overall, we find that the observed changes in the spectral slope are consistent with a mean particle size of aerosols varying with time between 1 and 2 {\mu}m. Observations with different solar zenith angles make it possible to characterize the aerosol layer at different altitudes, revealing a decrease of the particle size of aerosols as altitude increases. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.3448;New near-IR observations of mesospheric CO2 and H2O clouds on Mars; Mathieu Vincendon,  Cedric Pilorget,  Brigitte Gondet,  Scott Murchie,  Jean-Pierre Bibring;  Carbon dioxide clouds, which are speculated by models on solar and extra-solar planets, have been recently observed near the equator of Mars. The most comprehensive identification of Martian CO2 ice clouds has been obtained by the near-IR imaging spectrometer OMEGA. CRISM, a similar instrument with a higher spatial resolution, cannot detect these clouds with the same method due to its shorter wavelength range. Here we present a new method to detect CO2 clouds using near-IR data based on the comparison of H2O and CO2 ice spectral properties. The spatial and seasonal distributions of 54 CRISM observations containing CO2 clouds are reported, in addition to 17 new OMEGA observations. CRISM CO2 clouds are characterized by grain size in the 0.5-2\mum range and optical depths lower than 0.3. The distributions of CO2 clouds inferred from OMEGA and CRISM are consistent with each other and match at first order the distribution of high altitude (>60km) clouds derived from previous studies. At second order, discrepancies are observed. We report the identification of H2O clouds extending up to 80 km altitude, which could explain part of these discrepancies: both CO2 and H2O clouds can exist at high, mesospheric altitudes. CRISM observations of afternoon CO2 clouds display morphologies resembling terrestrial cirrus, which generalizes a previous result to the whole equatorial clouds season. Finally, we show that morning OMEGA observations have been previously misinterpreted as evidence for cumuliform, and hence potentially convective, CO2 clouds. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.0013;From dust to planetesimals: an improved model for collisional growth in  protoplanetary disks; Pascale Garaud,  Farzana Meru,  Marina Galvagni,  Christoph Olczak;"  Planet formation occurs within the gas and dust rich environments of protoplanetary disks. Observations of these objects show that the growth of primordial sub micron sized particles into larger aggregates occurs at the earliest stages of the disks. However, theoretical models of particle growth that use the Smoluchowski equation to describe collisional coagulation and fragmentation have so far failed to produce large particles while maintaining a significant populations of small grains. This has been generally attributed to the existence of two barriers impeding growth due to bouncing and fragmentation of colliding particles. In this paper, we demonstrate that the importance of these barriers has been artificially inflated through the use of simplified models that do not take into account the stochastic nature of the particle motions within the gas disk. We present a new approach in which the relative velocities between two particles is described by a probability distribution function that models both deterministic motion and stochastic motion. Taking both into account can give quite different results to what has been considered recently in other studies. We demonstrate the vital effect of two ""ingredients"" for particle growth: the proper implementation of a velocity distribution function that overcomes the bouncing barrier and, in combination with mass transfer in high-mass-ratio collisions, boosts the growth of larger particles beyond the fragmentation barrier. A robust result of our simulations is the emergence of two particle populations (small and large), potentially explaining simultaneously a number of long-standing problems in protoplanetary disks, including planetesimal formation close to the central star, the presence of mm to cm size particles far out in the disk, and the persistence of micron-size grains for millions of years.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.0050;Exomoon habitability constrained by energy flux and orbital stability; RenÃ© Heller;  Detecting massive satellites of extrasolar planets has now become feasible, which led naturally to questions about their habitability. In a previous study we presented constraints on the habitability of moons from stellar and planetary illumination as well as from tidal heating. Here I refine our model by including the effect of eclipses on the orbit-averaged illumination. Moons in low-mass stellar systems must orbit their planet very closely to remain bound, which puts them at risk of strong tidal heating. I first describe the effect of eclipses on stellar illumination of satellites. Then I calculate the orbit-averaged energy flux including illumination from the planet and tidal heating. Habitability is defined by a scaling relation at which a moon loses its water by the runaway greenhouse process. As a working hypothesis, orbital stability is assumed if the moon's orbital period is less than 1/9 of the planet's orbital period. Due to eclipses, a satellite in a close orbit can experience a reduction in orbit-averaged stellar flux by up to about 6%. The smaller the semi-major axis and the lower the inclination of the moon's orbit, the stronger the reduction. I find a lower mass limit of ~0.2M_sun for exomoon host stars to avoid the runaway greenhouse effect. Precise estimates depend on the satellite's orbital eccentricity. Deleterious effects on exomoon habitability may occur up to ~0.5M_sun. Although the habitable zone lies close to low-mass stars, which allows for many transits of planet-moon binaries within a given observation cycle, resources should not be spent to trace habitable satellites around them. Gravitational perturbations by the star, another planet, or another satellite induce eccentricities that likely make any moon uninhabitable. Estimates for individual systems require dynamical simulations that include perturbations among all bodies and tidal heating in the satellite. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.0101;The Spin Effect on Planetary Radial Velocimetry of Exoplanets; Hajime Kawahara;  We consider the effect of planetary spin on the planetary radial velocity (PRV) in dayside spectra of exoplanets. To understand the spin effect qualitatively, we derive an analytic formula of the intensity-weighted radial velocity from planetary surface on the following assumptions: 1) constant and solid rotation without precession, 2) stable and uniform distribution of molecules/atoms, 3) emission models from dayside hemisphere, and 4) a circular orbit. On these assumptions, we find that the curve of the PRV is distorted by the planetary spin and this anomaly is characterized by spin radial velocity at equator and a projected angle on a celestial plane between the spin axis and the axis of orbital motion \lambda_p in a manner analogous to the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. The latter can constrain the planetary obliquity. Creating mock PRV data with 3 km/s accuracy, we demonstrate how \lambda_p and the spin radial velocity at equator are estimated. We find that the stringent constraint of eccentricity is crucial to detect the spin effect. Though our formula is still qualitative, we conclude that the PRV in the dayside spectra will be a powerful means for constraining the planetary spin. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.0470;Non-barotropic linear Rossby wave instability in three-dimensional disks; Min-Kai Lin;  Astrophysical disks with localized radial structure, such as protoplanetary disks containing dead zones or gaps due to disk-planet interaction, may be subject to the non-axisymmetric Rossby wave instability (RWI) that lead to vortex-formation. The linear instability has recently been demonstrated in three-dimensional (3D) barotropic disks. It is the purpose of this study to generalize the 3D linear problem to include an energy equation, thereby accounting for baroclinity in three-dimensions. Linear stability calculations are presented for radially structured, vertically stratified, geometrically-thin disks with non-uniform entropy distribution in both directions. Polytropic equilibria are considered but adiabatic perturbations assumed. The unperturbed disk has a localized radial density bump making it susceptible to the RWI. The linearized fluid equations are solved numerically as a partial differential equation eigenvalue problem. Emphasis on the ease of method implementation is given. It is found that when the polytropic index is fixed and adiabatic index increased, non-uniform entropy has negligible effect on the RWI growth rate, but pressure and density perturbation magnitudes near a pressure enhancement increases away from the midplane. The associated meridional flow is also qualitatively changed from homentropic calculations. Meridional vortical motion is identified in the nonhomentropic linear solution, as well as in a nonlinear global hydrodynamic simulation of the RWI in an initially isothermal disk evolved adiabatically. Numerical results suggest buoyancy forces play an important role in the internal flow of Rossby vortices. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Mills;  Ground based observers have on 5/6th June 2012 the last opportunity of the century to watch the passage of Venus across the solar disk from Earth. Venus transits have traditionally provided unique insight into the Venus atmosphere through the refraction halo that appears at the planet outer terminator near ingress/egress. Much more recently, Venus transits have attracted renewed interest because the technique of transits is being successfully applied to the characterization of extrasolar planet atmospheres. The current work investigates theoretically the interaction of sunlight and the Venus atmosphere through the full range of transit phases, as observed from Earth and from a remote distance. Our model predictions quantify the relevant atmospheric phenomena, thereby assisting the observers of the event in the interpretation of measurements and the extrapolation to the exoplanet case. Our approach relies on the numerical integration of the radiative transfer equation, and includes refraction, multiple scattering, atmospheric extinction and solar limb darkening, as well as an up to date description of the Venus atmosphere. We produce synthetic images of the planet terminator during ingress/egress that demonstrate the evolving shape, brightness and chromaticity of the halo. Guidelines are offered for the investigation of the planet upper haze from vertically-unresolved photometric measurements. In this respect, the comparison with measurements from the 2004 transit appears encouraging. We also show integrated lightcurves of the Venus/Sun system at various phases during transit and calculate the respective Venus-Sun integrated transmission spectra. The comparison of the model predictions to those for a Venus-like planet free of haze and clouds (and therefore a closer terrestrial analogue) complements the discussion and sets the conclusions into a broader perspective. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

The raw irradiance data exhibit a marked seasonal cycle, extended periods of lower irradiance due to emissions of volcanic aerosols, and a long-term decrease in atmospheric transmission independent of solar activity. After correcting for these effects, it is found that clear-sky terrestrial irradiance typically varies by about 0.2 +/- 0.1% over the course of the solar cycle, a change of the same order of magnitude as the variations of the total solar irradiance above the atmosphere. An investigation of changes in the clear-sky atmospheric transmission fails to find a significant trend with sunspot number. Hence there is no evidence for a yet unknown effect amplifying variations of clear-sky irradiance with solar activity. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics (physics.ao-ph)"

Tinney;  In 2009, the discovery of two planets orbiting the evolved binary star system HW Virginis was announced, based on systematic variations in the timing of eclipses between the two stars. The planets invoked in that work were significantly more massive than Jupiter, and moved on orbits that were mutually crossing - an architecture which suggests that mutual encounters and strong gravitational interactions are almost guaranteed. In this work, we perform a highly detailed analysis of the proposed HW Vir planetary system. First, we consider the dynamical stability of the system as proposed in the discovery work. Through a mapping process involving 91,125 individual simulations, we find that the system is so unstable that the planets proposed simply cannot exist, due to mean lifetimes of less than a thousand years across the whole parameter space. We then present a detailed re-analysis of the observational data on HW Vir, deriving a new orbital solution that provides a very good fit to the observational data. Our new analysis yields a system with planets more widely spaced, and of lower mass, than that proposed in the discovery work, and yields a significantly greater (and more realistic) estimate of the uncertainty in the orbit of the outermost body. Despite this, a detailed dynamical analysis of this new solution similarly reveals that it also requires the planets to move on orbits that are simply not dynamically feasible. Our results imply that some mechanism other than the influence of planetary companions must be the principal cause of the observed eclipse timing variations for HW Vir. If the sys- tem does host exoplanets, they must move on orbits differing greatly from those previously proposed. Our results illustrate the critical importance of performing dynamical analyses as a part of the discovery process for multiple-planet exoplanetary systems. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)"

Observations of young binary stars can therefore be used to test models of disk evolution, and I show that current data set a strong upper limit to the rate of on-going photoevaporation (<1e-9 M_sun/yr).

https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.1107;On the convergence of the critical cooling timescale for the  fragmentation of self-gravitating discs; Farzana Meru,  Matthew R. Bate;  We carry out simulations of gravitationally unstable discs using a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code and a grid-based hydrodynamics code, FARGO, to understand the previous non-convergent results reported by Meru & Bate (2011a). We obtain evidence that convergence with increasing resolution occurs with both SPH and FARGO and in both cases we find that the critical cooling timescale is larger than previously thought. We show that SPH has a first-order convergence rate while FARGO converges with a second-order rate. We show that the convergence of the critical cooling timescale for fragmentation depends largely on the numerical viscosity employed in both SPH and FARGO. With SPH, particle velocity dispersion may also play a role. We show that reducing the dissipation from the numerical viscosity leads to larger values of the critical cooling time at a given resolution. For SPH, we find that the effect of the dissipation due to the numerical viscosity is somewhat larger than had previously been appreciated. In particular, we show that using a quadratic term in the SPH artificial viscosity (beta_{SPH}) that is too low appears to lead to excess dissipation in gravitationally unstable discs, which may affect any results that sensitively depend on the thermodynamics, such as disc fragmentation. We show that the two codes converge to values of the critical cooling timescale, beta_{crit} > 20 (for a ratio of specific heats of gamma=5/3), and perhaps even as large as beta_{crit} \approx 30. These are approximately 3-5 times larger than has been found by most previous studies. This is equivalent to a maximum gravitational stress that a disc can withstand without fragmenting of alpha_{GI,crit} \approx 0.013-0.02, which is much smaller than the values typically used in the literature. It is therefore easier for self-gravitating discs to fragment than has been concluded from most past studies. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)"

The albedo of 2008 EV5 remains uncertain with a lower limit at 0.05 and a higher end at 0.20 based on thermal modeling. The Busch et al. (2011) albedo estimate of 0.12 is consistent with our thermal modeling results. The albedo and composition of 2008 EV5 are also consistent with a C-type taxonomic classification (Somers et al. 2008). The best spectral match is with CI carbonaceous chondrites similar to Orgueil, which also have a weak 0.48-microns feature and an overall blue slope. This 0.48-microns feature is also seen in the spectrum of magnetite. The albedo of CI chondrites is at the lower limit of our estimated range for the albedo of 2008 EV5. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Space Physics (physics.space-ph)"

Nichols;  In this paper we consider the magnetosphere-ionosphere (M-I) coupling at Jupiter-like exoplanets with internal plasma sources such as volcanic moons, and we have determined the best candidates for detection of these radio emissions by estimating the maximum spectral flux density expected from planets orbiting stars within 25 pc using data listed in the NASA/IPAC/NExScI Star and Exoplanet Database (NStED). In total we identify 91 potential targets, of which 40 already host planets and 51 have stellar X-ray luminosity 100 times the solar value. In general, we find that stronger planetary field strength, combined with faster rotation rate, higher stellar XUV luminosity, and lower stellar wind dynamic pressure results in higher radio power. The top two targets for each category are $\epsilon$ Eri and HIP 85523, and CPD-28 332 and FF And. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Space Physics (physics.space-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.1320;Effects of Dynamical Evolution of Giant Planets on Survival of  Terrestrial Planets; Soko Matsumura,  Shigeru Ida,  Makiko Nagasawa;"  The orbital distributions of currently observed extrasolar giant planets allow marginally stable orbits for hypothetical, terrestrial planets. In this paper, we propose that many of these systems may not have additional planets on these ""stable"" orbits, since past dynamical instability among giant planets could have removed them. We numerically investigate the effects of early evolution of multiple giant planets on the orbital stability of the inner, sub-Neptune-like planets which are modeled as test particles, and determine their dynamically unstable region. Previous studies have shown that the majority of such test particles are ejected out of the system as a result of close encounters with giant planets. Here, we show that secular perturbations from giant planets can remove test particles at least down to 10 times smaller than their minimum pericenter distance. Our results indicate that, unless the dynamical instability among giant planets is either absent or quiet like planet-planet collisions, most test particles down to ~0.1 AU within the orbits of giant planets at a few AU may be gone. In fact, out of ~30 % of survived test particles, about three quarters belong to the planet-planet collision cases. We find a good agreement between our numerical results and the secular theory, and present a semi-analytical formula which estimates the dynamically unstable region of the test particles just from the evolution of giant planets. Finally, our numerical results agree well with the observations, and also predict the existence of hot rocky planets in eccentric giant planet systems.

We also investigate the effect of varying the assumed physical and orbital parameters on the best-fitting age. We find that the physically allowed range of assumed values for the density and thermal conductivity induces a large uncertainty in the rate of evolution. When realistic uncertainties in the family members' physical parameters are taken into account we find the best-fitting age can fall anywhere in the range of 140-320 Myr. Without more information on the physical properties of the family members it is difficult to place a more firm constraint on Baptistina's age. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.1549;WISE/NEOWISE Observations of the Jovian Trojan Population: Taxonomy; Tommy Grav,  Amy K. Mainzer,  James M. Bauer,  Joe R. Masiero,  Carrie R. Nugent;  We present updated/new thermal model fits for 478 Jovian Trojan asteroids observed with the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). Using the fact that the two shortest bands used by WISE, centered on 3.4 and $4.6\mu$m, are dominated by reflected light, we derive albedos of a significant fraction of these objects in these bands. While the visible albedos of both the C-, P- and D-type asteroids are strikingly similar, the WISE data reveal that the albedo at $3.4\mu$m is different between C-/P- and D-types. The albedo at 3.4$\mu$m can be thus be used to classify the objects, with C-/P-types having values less than 10%, and D-types have values larger than 10%. Classifying all objects larger than 50km shows that the D-type objects dominate both the leading cloud ($L_4$), with a fraction of 84%, and trailing cloud ($L_5$), with a fraction of 71-80%. The two clouds thus have very similar taxonomic distribution for these large objects, but the leading cloud has a larger number of of these large objects, $L_4/L_5 = 1.34$. The taxonomic distribution of the Jovian Trojans are found to be different than that of the large Hildas, which is dominated by C- and P-type objects. At smaller sizes, the fraction of D-type Hildas starts increasing, showing more similarities with the Jovian Trojans. If this similarity is confirmed through deeper surveys, it could hold important clues to the formation and evolution of the two populations. The Jovian Trojans does have similar taxonomic distribution to that of the Jovian irregular satellites, but lacks the ultra red surfaces found among the Saturnian irregular satellites and Centaur population. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.1577;(309239) 2007 RW10: a large temporary quasi-satellite of Neptune; C. de la Fuente Marcos,  R. de la Fuente Marcos;"  Upon discovery, asteroid (309239) 2007 RW10 was considered a Neptune Trojan candidate. The object is currently listed by the Minor Planet Center as a Centaur but it is classified as a Scattered Disk or Trans-Neptunian Object by others. Now that its arc-length is 8,154 days and has been observed for more than 20 years, a more robust classification should be possible. Here we explore the orbital behaviour of this object in order to reveal its current dynamical status; we perform N-body simulations in both directions of time to investigate the evolution of its orbital elements. In particular, we study the librational properties of the mean longitude that currently librates around the value of the mean longitude of Neptune with an amplitude of nearly 50 degrees and a period of about 7,500 years. Our calculations show that it has been in its present dynamical state for about 12,500 years and it will stay there for another 12,500 years. Therefore, its current state is relatively short-lived. Due to its chaotic behaviour, the object may have remained in the 1:1 mean motion resonance with Neptune for several 100,000 years at most, undergoing transitions between the various resonant states. (309239) 2007 RW10 is currently a quasi-satellite, the first object of this dynamical class to be discovered around Neptune. With a diameter of about 250 km, it is the largest known co-orbital in the Solar System. Its significant eccentricity (0.30) and orbital inclination (36 degrees), strongly suggest that it did not form in situ but was captured, likely from beyond Neptune. With an apparent magnitude of 21.1 at opposition (October), it is well suited for spectroscopic observations that may provide information on its surface composition and hence eventually its origin.

Michtchenko,  Hauke Hussmann;"  We investigate the spin behavior of close-in rocky planets and the implications for their orbital evolution. Considering that the planet rotation evolves under simultaneous actions of the torque due to the equatorial deformation and the tidal torque, both raised by the central star, we analyze the possibility of temporary captures in spin-orbit resonances. The results of the numerical simulations of the exact equations of motions indicate that, whenever the planet rotation is trapped in a resonant motion, the orbital decay and the eccentricity damping are faster than the ones in which the rotation follows the so-called pseudo-synchronization. Analytical results obtained through the averaged equations of the spin-orbit problem show a good agreement with the numerical simulations. We apply the analysis to the cases of the recently discovered hot super-Earths Kepler-10 b, GJ 3634 b and 55 Cnc e. The simulated dynamical history of these systems indicates the possibility of capture in several spin-orbit resonances; particularly, GJ 3634 b and 55 Cnc e can currently evolve under a non-synchronous resonant motion for suitable values of the parameters. Moreover, 55 Cnc e may avoid a chaotic rotation behavior by evolving towards synchronization through successive temporary resonant trappings. ";Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.1615;Tidal Friction and Tidal Lagging. Applicability Limitations of a Popular  Formula for the Tidal Torque; Michael Efroimsky,  Valeri V. Makarov;"  Tidal torques play a key role in rotational dynamics of celestial bodies. They govern these bodies' tidal despinning, and also participate in the subtle process of entrapment of these bodies into spin-orbit resonances. This makes tidal torques directly relevant to the studies of habitability of planets and their moons. Our work begins with an explanation of how friction and lagging should be built into the theory of bodily tides. Although much of this material can be found in various publications, a short but self-consistent summary on the topic has been lacking in the hitherto literature, and we are filling the gap. After these preparations, we address a popular concise formula for the tidal torque, which is often used in the literature, for planets or stars.We explain why the derivation of this expression, offered in the paper by Goldreich (1966; AJ 71, 1 - 7) and in the books by Kaula (1968, eqn. 4.5.29), and Murray & Dermott (1999, eqn. 4.159), implicitly sets the time lag to be frequency independent. Accordingly, the ensuing expression for the torque can be applied only to bodies having a very special (and very hypothetical) rheology which makes the time lag frequency independent, i.e, the same for all Fourier modes in the spectrum of tide. This expression for the torque should not be used for bodies of other rheologies. Specifically, the expression cannot be combined with an extra assertion of the geometric lag (or the phase lag) being constant, because at finite eccentricities the said assumption is incompatible with the constant-time-lag condition.

Makarov,  Michael Efroimsky;  We reexamine the popular belief that a telluric planet or satellite on an eccentric orbit can, outside a spin-orbit resonance, be captured in a quasi-static tidal equilibrium called pseudosynchronous rotation. The existence of such configurations was deduced from oversimplified tidal models assuming either a constant tidal torque or a torque linear in the tidal frequency. A more accurate treatment requires that the torque be decomposed into the Darwin-Kaula series over the tidal modes, and that this decomposition be combined with a realistic choice of rheological properties of the mantle. This development demonstrates that there exist no stable equilibrium states for solid planets and moons, other than spin-orbit resonances. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Geophysics (physics.geo-ph)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.1833;An Analytic Radiative-Convective Model for Planetary Atmospheres; Tyler D. Robinson,  David C. Catling;  We present an analytic 1-D radiative-convective model of the thermal structure of planetary atmospheres. Our model assumes that thermal radiative transfer is gray and can be represented by the two-stream approximation. Model atmospheres are assumed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium, with a power law scaling between the atmospheric pressure and the gray thermal optical depth. The convective portions of our models are taken to follow adiabats that account for condensation of volatiles through a scaling parameter to the dry adiabat. By combining these assumptions, we produce simple, analytic expressions that allow calculations of the atmospheric pressure-temperature profile, as well as expressions for the profiles of thermal radiative flux and convective flux. We explore the general behaviors of our model. These investigations encompass (1) worlds where atmospheric attenuation of sunlight is weak, which we show tend to have relatively high radiative-convective boundaries, (2) worlds with some attenuation of sunlight throughout the atmosphere, which we show can produce either shallow or deep radiative-convective boundaries, depending on the strength of sunlight attenuation, and (3) strongly irradiated giant planets (including Hot Jupiters), where we explore the conditions under which these worlds acquire detached convective regions in their mid-tropospheres. Finally, we validate our model and demonstrate its utility through comparisons to the average observed thermal structure of Venus, Jupiter, and Titan, and by comparing computed flux profiles to more complex models. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Mayer,  R. Roskar,  P. Saha;  We present 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of the collapse of clumps formed through gravitational instability in the outer part of a protoplanetary disc. The initial conditions are taken directly from a global disc simulation, and a realistic equation of state is used to follow the clumps as they contract over several orders of magnitude in density, approaching the molecular hydrogen dissociation stage. The effects of clump rotation, asymmetries, and radiative cooling are studied. Rotation provides support against fast collapse, but non-axisymmetric modes develop and efficiently transport angular momentum outward, forming a circumplanetary disc. This transport helps the clump reach the dynamical collapse phase, resulting from molecular hydrogen dissociation, on a thousand-year timescale, which is smaller than timescales predicted by some previous spherical 1D collapse models. Extrapolation to the threshold of the runaway hydrogen dissociation indicates that the collapse timescales can be shorter than inward migration timescales, suggesting that clumps could survive tidal disruption and deliver a proto-gas giant to distances of even a few AU from the central star. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

We used the Canada-France-Hawaii telescope to obtain wide-field images of 17P/Holmes on 15 dates over a period of 3 months following the outburst and employ them here to examine the subsequent activity of the nucleus and the nature of the ejecta closest to the nucleus. Through aperture photometry we observed the in- ner coma (within 2500 km of the nucleus) to fade from an apparent magnitude of 11.7 mag to 17.6 mag, corresponding to absolute magnitudes of 8.1 mag and 12.4 mag, between UT 2007 Nov. 6 and 2008 Feb. 12. A second much smaller outburst occurred on UT 2007 Nov. 12, three weeks after the original outburst, suggesting that the nucleus remained unstable. The surface brightness profile of the inner coma was consistently shallow relative to the expected steady-state profile, and showed a persistent brightness enhancement within ~ 5000 km of the nucleus. We propose that sublimating ice grains created an ice grain halo around the nucleus, while fragmenting grains were responsible for the shallow surface brightness profile. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

In this work, we fit the outburst of P/2010 A2 with a conical burst model, and verify previous suspicions that this was a one--time collisional event rather than an sustained cometary outburst, implying that P/2010 A2 is not a new Main Belt Comet driven by ice sublimation. We find that the best--fit cone opening angle is about 40 to 50 degrees, in agreement with numerical and laboratory simulations of cratering events. Mapping debris orbits to sky positions suggests that the distinctive arc features in the debris correspond to the same debris cone inferred from the extended dust. From the velocity of the debris, and from the presence of a velocity maximum at around 15 cm/s, we infer that the surface of A2 probably has a very low strength (<1 kPa), comparable to lunar regolith. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

We present a preliminary analysis of the images, which provide a characterization of the dust environment at heliocentric distances similar to those planned for the initial spacecraft encounter, but on the outbound leg of its orbit rather than the inbound. Broad-band photometry yields low levels of CO2 production at a comet heliocentric distance of 3.32 AU and no detectable production at 4.18 AU. We find that at these heliocentric distances, large dust grains with mean grain diameters on the order of a millimeter or greater dominate the coma and evolve to populate the tail. This is further supported by broad-band photometry centered on the nucleus, which yield an estimated differential dust particle size distribution with a power law relation that is considerably shallower than average. We set a 3-sigma upper limit constraint on the albedo of the large-grain dust at <= 0.12. Our best estimate of the nucleus radius (1.82 +/- 0.20 km) and albedo (0.04 +/- 0.01) are in agreement with measurements previously reported in the literature. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.2412;C/O ratio as a Dimension for Characterizing Exoplanetary Atmospheres; Nikku Madhusudhan (Yale University);  Until recently, infrared observations of exoplanetary atmospheres have typically been interpreted using models that assumed solar elemental abundances. With the chemical composition fixed, attempts have been made to classify hot Jupiter atmospheres on the basis of stellar irradiation. However, recent observations have revealed deviations from predictions based on such classification schemes, and chemical compositions retrieved from some datasets have also indicated non-solar abundances. In hot hydrogen-dominated atmospheres, the C/O ratio critically influences the relative concentrations of several spectroscopically dominant molecules. Between a C/O of 0.5 (solar value) and 2, the H2O and CH4 abundances can vary by several orders of magnitude in the observable atmosphere, and new hydrocarbon species such as HCN and C2H2 become prominent for C/O >= 1, while the CO abundance remains almost unchanged. Furthermore, a C/O >= 1 can preclude a strong thermal inversion due to TiO and VO in a hot Jupiter atmosphere, since TiO and VO are naturally under-abundant for C/O >= 1. We, therefore, suggest a new two-dimensional classification scheme for hydrogen-dominated exoplanetary atmospheres with irradiation (or temperature) and C/O ratio as the two dimensions. We define four classes in this 2-D space (O1, O2, C1, and C2) with distinct chemical, thermal and spectral properties. We characterize the thermal structures and C/O ratios of six hot Jupiters (XO-1b, CoRoT-2b, WASP-14b, WASP-19b, WASP-33b, and WASP-12b) in the framework of our proposed 2D classification scheme. While the data for several systems in our sample are consistent with carbon-rich atmospheres (i.e. C/O >= 1), new observations are required to conclusively constrain the C/O ratios in their atmospheres. We discuss how observations using existing and forthcoming facilities can constrain C/O ratios in exoplanetary atmospheres. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.2728;Pulsation Frequencies and Modes of Giant Exoplanets; Bastien Le Bihan,  Adam Burrows;  We calculate the eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions of the acoustic oscillations of giant exoplanets and explore the dependence of the characteristic frequency and the eigenfrequencies on several parameters: the planet mass, the planet radius, the core mass, and the heavy element mass fraction in the envelope. We provide the eigenvalues for degree $l$ up to 8 and radial order n up to 12. For the selected values of l and n, we find that the pulsation eigenfrequencies depend strongly on the planet mass and radius, especially at high frequency. We quantify this dependence through the calculation of the characteristic frequency which gives us an estimate of the scale of the eigenvalue spectrum at high frequency. For the mass range 0.5 < M_P < 15 M_J, and fixing the planet radius to the Jovian value, we find that the characteristic frequency is ~164.0 * (M_P/M_J)^(0.48) microHz, where M_P is the planet mass and M_J is Jupiter's mass. For the radius range from 0.9 to 2.0 R_J, and fixing the planet's mass to the Jovian value, we find that the characteristic frequency is ~164.0 * (R_P/R_J)^(-2.09) microHz, where R_P is the planet radius and R_J is Jupiter's radius. We explore the influence of the presence of a dense core on the pulsation frequencies and on the characteristic frequency of giant exoplanets. We find that the presence of heavy elements in the envelope affects the eigenvalue distribution in ways similar to the presence of a dense core. Additionally, we apply our formalism to Jupiter and Saturn and find results consistent with both the observationnal data of Gaulme et al.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.2753;Linear and nonlinear evolution of the vertical shear instability in  accretion discs; Richard P. Nelson,  Oliver Gressel,  Orkan M. Umurhan;  (Abridged) We analyse the stability and evolution of power-law accretion disc models. These have midplane densities that follow radial power-laws, and have either temperature or entropy distributions that are power-law functions of cylindrical radius. We employ two different hydrodynamic codes to perform 2D-axisymmetric and 3D simulations that examine the long-term evolution of the disc models as a function of the power-law indices of the temperature or entropy, the thermal relaxation time of the fluid, and the viscosity. We present a stability analysis of the problem that we use to interpret the simulation results. We find that disc models whose temperature or entropy profiles cause the equilibrium angular velocity to vary with height are unstable to the growth of modes with wavenumber ratios |k_R/k_Z| >> 1 when the thermodynamic response of the fluid is isothermal, or the thermal evolution time is comparable to or shorter than the local dynamical time scale. These discs are subject to the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke (GSF) or `vertical shear' linear instability. Development of the instability involves excitation of vertical breathing and corrugation modes in the disc, with the corrugation modes in particular being a feature of the nonlinear saturated state. Instability operates when the dimensionless disc kinematic viscosity nu < 10^{-6} (Reynolds numbers Re>H c_s/nu > 2500). In 3D the instability generates a quasi-turbulent flow, and the Reynolds stress produces a fluctuating effective viscosity coefficient whose mean value reaches alpha ~ 6 x 10^{-4} by the end of the simulation. The vertical shear instability in disc models which include realistic thermal physics has yet to be examined. Should it occur, however, our results suggest that it will have significant consequences for their internal dynamics, transport properties, and observational appearance. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

We study the soft X-ray emission induced by charge exchange (CX) collisions between solar-wind, highly charged ions and neutral atoms of the Martian exosphere. Methods. A 3D multi species hybrid simulation model with improved spatial resolution (130 km) is used to describe the interaction between the solar wind and the Martian neutrals. We calculated velocity and density distributions of the solar wind plasma in the Martian environment with realistic planetary ions description, using spherically symmetric exospheric H and O profiles. Following that, a 3D test-particle model was developed to compute the X-ray emission produced by CX collisions between neutrals and solar wind minor ions. The model results are compared to XMM-Newton observations of Mars. Results. We calculate projected X-ray emission maps for the XMM-Newton observing conditions and demonstrate how the X-ray emission reflects the Martian electromagnetic structure in accordance with the observed X-ray images. Our maps confirm that X-ray images are a powerful tool for the study of solar wind - planetary interfaces. However, the simulation results reveal several quantitative discrepancies compared to the observations. Typical solar wind and neutral coronae conditions corresponding to the 2003 observation period of Mars cannot reproduce the high luminosity or the corresponding very extended halo observed with XMM-Newton. Potential explanations of these discrepancies are discussed. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.2943;The ballistic transport instability in Saturn's rings I: formalism and  linear theory; Henrik Latter,  Gordon Ogilvie,  Marie Chupeau;  Planetary rings sustain a continual bombardment of hypervelocity meteoroids that erode the surfaces of ring particles on time scales of 10^5 - 10^7 years. The debris ejected from such impacts re-accretes on to the ring, though often at a slightly different orbital radius from the point of emission. This `ballistic transport' leads to a rearrangement of the disk's mass and angular momentum, and gives rise to a linear instability that generates structure on relatively large scales. It is likely that the 100-km undulations in Saturn's inner B-ring and the plateaus and 1000-km waves in Saturn's C-ring are connected to the nonlinear saturation of the instability. In this paper the physical problem is reformulated so as to apply to a local patch of disk (the shearing sheet). This new streamlined model helps facilitate our physical understanding of the instability, and also makes more tractable the analysis of its nonlinear dynamics. We concentrate on the linear theory in this paper, showing that the instability is restricted to a preferred range of intermediate wavenumbers and optical depths. We subsequently apply these general results to the inner B-ring and the C-ring and find that in both regions the ballistic transport instability should be near marginality, a fact that may have important consequences for its prevalence and nonlinear development. Owing to damping via self-gravity wakes, the instability should not be present in the A-ring. A following paper will explore the instability's nonlinear saturation and how it connects to the observed large-scale structure. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

We find an absolute magnitude of $H_R=19.71\pm0.05$ mag and slope parameter of $G_R=-0.08\pm0.05$ for the inactive nucleus, corresponding to an effective nucleus radius of $r_e=0.30\pm0.02$ km, assuming an $R$-band albedo of $p_R=0.05$. We also revisit observations reported for 259P while it was active in 2008 to quantify the dust mass loss and compare the object with other known main-belt comets. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.3116;Plutino 15810 (1994 JR1), an accidental quasi-satellite of Pluto; C. de la Fuente Marcos,  R. de la Fuente Marcos;  In the solar system, quasi-satellites move in a 1:1 mean motion resonance going around their host body like a retrograde satellite but their mutual separation is well beyond the Hill radius and the trajectory is not closed as they orbit the Sun not the host body. So far, minor bodies temporarily trapped in the quasi-satellite dynamical state have been identified around Venus, Earth, the dwarf planet (1) Ceres, the large asteroid (4) Vesta, Jupiter, Saturn and Neptune. Using computer simulations, Tiscareno and Malhotra have predicted the existence of a small but significant population of minor bodies moving in a 1:1 mean motion resonance with Pluto. Here we show using N-body calculations that the Plutino 15810 (1994 JR1) is currently an accidental quasi-satellite of Pluto and it will remain as such for nearly 350,000 yr. By accidental we mean that the quasi-satellite phase is triggered (or terminated) not by a direct gravitational influence in the form of a discrete close encounter but as a result of a resonance. The relative mean longitude of the Plutino circulates with a superimposed libration resulting from the oscillation of the orbital period induced by the 2:3 mean motion resonance with Neptune. These quasi-satellite episodes are recurrent with a periodicity of nearly 2 Myr. This makes 15810 the first minor body moving in a 1:1 mean motion resonance with Pluto. It also makes Pluto the second dwarf planet, besides Ceres, to host a quasi-satellite. Our finding confirms that the quasi-satellite resonant phase is not restricted to small bodies orbiting major planets but is possible for dwarf planets/asteroids too. Moreover, 15810 could be considered as a possible secondary target for NASA's Pluto-Kuiper Belt Mission New Horizons after the main Pluto flyby in 2015. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.3154;The impact of red noise in radial velocity planet searches: Only three  planets orbiting GJ581?; Roman V. Baluev;"  We perform a detailed analysis of the latest HARPS and Keck radial velocity data for the planet-hosting red dwarf GJ581, which attracted a lot of attention in recent time. We show that these data contain important correlated noise component (""red noise"") with the correlation timescale of the order of 10 days. This red noise imposes a lot of misleading effects while we work in the traditional white-noise model. To eliminate these misleading effects, we propose a maximum-likelihood algorithm equipped by an extended model of the noise structure. We treat the red noise as a Gaussian random process with exponentially decaying correlation function. Using this method we prove that: (i) planets b and c do exist in this system, since they can be independently detected in the HARPS and Keck data, and regardless of the assumed noise models; (ii) planet e can also be confirmed independently by the both datasets, although to reveal it in the Keck data it is mandatory to take the red noise into account; (iii) the recently announced putative planets f and g are likely just illusions of the red noise; (iv) the reality of the planet candidate GJ581 d is questionable, because it cannot be detected from the Keck data, and its statistical significance in the HARPS data (as well as in the combined dataset) drops to a marginal level of $\sim 2\sigma$, when the red noise is taken into account. Therefore, the current data for GJ581 really support existence of no more than four (or maybe even only three) orbiting exoplanets. The planet candidate GJ581 d requests serious observational verification. ";"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM)"

We find no or little variation of the derived surface He density with latitude but day-to-day variations that likely reflect variations in the solar wind alpha flux. The 5-day passage of the Moon through the Earth's magnetotail results in a factor of two decrease in surface density, which is well explained by model simulations. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.3635;On the origin of elemental abundances in the terrestrial planets; Sebastian Elser,  Michael R. Meyer,  Ben Moore;  The abundances of elements in the Earth and the terrestrial planets provide the initial conditions for life and clues as to the history and formation of the Solar System. We follow the pioneering work of Bond et al. (2010) and combine circumstellar disk models, chemical equilibrium calculations and dynamical simulations of planet formation to study the bulk composition of rocky planets. We use condensation sequence calculations to estimate the initial abundance of solids in the circumstellar disk with properties determined from time dependent theoretical models. We combine this with dynamical simulations of planetesimal growth that trace the solids during the planet formation process. We calculate the elemental abundances in the resulting planets and explore how these vary with the choice of disk model and the initial conditions within the Solar Nebula. Although certain characteristics of the terrestrial planets in the Solar System could be reproduced, none of our models could reproduce the abundance properties of all the planets. We found that the choice of the initial planetesimal disk mass and of the disk model has a significant effect on composition gradients. Disk models that give higher pressure and temperature result in larger variations in the bulk chemical compositions of the resulting planets due to inhomogeneities in the element abundance profiles and due to the different source regions of the planets in the dynamical simulations. We observed a trend that massive planets and planets with relatively small semi-major axes are more sensitive to these variations than smaller planets at larger radial distance. Only these large variations in the simulated chemical abundances can potentially explain the diverse bulk composition of the Solar System planets, whereas Mercury's bulk composition can not be reproduced in our approach. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Tamura;  Through detailed radiative transfer modeling, we present a disk+cavity model to simultaneously explain both the SED and Subaru H-band polarized light imaging for the pre-transitional protoplanetary disk PDS 70. Particularly, we are able to match not only the radial dependence, but also the absolute scale, of the surface brightness of the scattered light. Our disk model has a cavity 65 AU in radius, which is heavily depleted of sub-micron-sized dust grains, and a small residual inner disk which produces a weak but still optically thick NIR excess in the SED. To explain the contrast of the cavity edge in the Subaru image, a factor of ~1000 depletion for the sub-micron-sized dust inside the cavity is required. The total dust mass of the disk may be on the order of 1e-4 M_sun, only weakly constrained due to the lack of long wavelength observations and the uncertainties in the dust model. The scale height of the sub-micron-sized dust is ~6 AU at the cavity edge, and the cavity wall is optically thick in the vertical direction at H-band. PDS 70 is not a member of the class of (pre-)transitional disks identified by Dong et al. (2012), whose members only show evidence of the cavity in the millimeter-sized dust but not the sub-micron-sized dust in resolved images. The two classes of (pre-)transitional disks may form through different mechanisms, or they may just be at different evolution stages in the disk clearing process. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.3780;The Mineralogy and Structure of the Inner Debris Disk of Î²  Pictoris; Dan Li,  Charles M. Telesco,  Christopher M. Wright;  We observed the edge-on, planet-bearing disk of {\beta} Pictoris using T-ReCS at Gemini to clarify and extend previous observations and conclusions about this unique system. Our spectroscopy and spectral modeling of the 10-micron silicate feature constrain the spatial distributions of three representative dust components (0.1-micron/2.0-micron glassy olivine and crystalline forsterite) across the inner 20-AU of the disk. We confirm that the 2.0-micron glassy olivine is strongly peaked in the disk center and that the 0.1-micron glassy olivine does not show this concentration, but rather is double peaked, with the peaks on either side of the star. However, we do not see the strong difference in brightness between those two peaks reported in a previous study. Although the spatial distribution of the 0.1-micron dust is consistent with the scenario of a dust-replenishing planetesimal belt embedded in the disk, we note an alternative interpretation that can explain the spatial distributions of the 0.1-micron and 2.0-micron grains simultaneously and does not require the planetesimal belt. In addition to the spectroscopy, we also obtained a new 11.7 micron image of the {\beta} Pic disk. By comparing this image with that acquired in 2003, we confirm the existence and overall shape of the dusty clump at 52 AU in the SW disk. We speculate that the clump's projected spatial displacement of ~2.0 AU, a 3.6-{\sigma} result, between two epochs separated by seven years is due to the Keplerian motion of the clump at an orbital radius of $54.3^{+2.0}_{-1.2}$ AU. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.3797;A multilayer model for thermal infrared emission of Saturn's rings. III:  Thermal inertia inferred from Cassini CIRS; Ryuji Morishima,  Linda Spilker,  Keiji Ohtsuki;  The thermal inertia values of Saturn's main rings (the A, B, and C rings and the Cassini division) are derived by applying our thermal model to azimuthally scanned spectra taken by the Cassini Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS). Model fits show the thermal inertia of ring particles to be 16, 13, 20, and 11 Jm$^{-2}$K$^{-1}$s$^{-1/2}$ for the A, B, and C rings, and the Cassini division, respectively. However, there are systematic deviations between modeled and observed temperatures in Saturn's shadow depending on solar phase angle, and these deviations indicate that the apparent thermal inertia increases with solar phase angle. This dependence is likely to be explained if large slowly spinning particles have lower thermal inertia values than those for small fast spinning particles because the thermal emission of slow rotators is relatively stronger than that of fast rotators at low phase and vise versa. Additional parameter fits, which assume that slow and fast rotators have different thermal inertia values, show the derived thermal inertia values of slow (fast) rotators to be 8 (77), 8 (27), 9 (34), 5 (55) Jm$^{-2}$K$^{-1}$s$^{-1/2}$ for the A, B, and C rings, and the Cassini division, respectively. The values for fast rotators are still much smaller than those for solid ice with no porosity. Thus, fast rotators are likely to have surface regolith layers, but these may not be as fluffy as those for slow rotators, probably because the capability of holding regolith particles is limited for fast rotators due to the strong centrifugal force on surfaces of fast rotators. Other additional parameter fits, in which radii of fast rotators are varied, indicate that particles less than $\sim$ 1 cm should not occupy more than a half of the cross section for the A, B, and C rings. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.3799;Regolith grain sizes of Saturn's rings inferred from Cassini-CIRS  far-infrared spectra; Ryuji Morishima,  Scott G. Edgington,  Linda Spilker;  We analyze far-infrared (10-650 cm$^{-1}$) emissivity spectra of Saturn's main rings obtained by the Cassini Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS). In modeling of the spectra, the single scattering albedos of regolith grains are calculated using the Mie theory, diffraction is removed with the delta-Eddington approximation, and the hemispherical emissivities of macroscopic free-floating ring particles are calculated using the Hapke's isotropic scattering model. Only pure crystalline water ice is considered and the size distribution of regolith grains is estimated. We find that good fits are obtained if the size distribution is broad ranging from 1 $\mu$m to 1-10 cm with a power law index of $ \sim 3$. This means that the largest regolith grains are comparable to the smallest free-floating particles in size and that the power law indices for both free-floating particles and regolith grains are similar to each other. The apparent relative abundance of small grains increases with decreasing solar phase angle (or increasing mean temperature). This trend is particularly strong for the C ring and is probably caused by eclipse cooling in Saturn's shadow, which relatively suppresses warming up of grains larger than the thermal skin depth ($\sim$ 1 mm) under subsequent solar illumination. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

This recovery was a time-critical effort for a mission proposal, and had to be performed in a crowded field. We describe techniques and software tools for eliminating systematic noise artifacts and stellar residuals, bringing the final detection image statistics close to the Gaussian ideal for a median image stack, and achieving a detection sensitivity close to this theoretical optimum. The magnitude of $R_c$=26.1$\pm$0.2 with an assumed geometric albedo of 0.05 corresponds to a radius of 0.3 km. For ice to have survived in this object over the age of the solar system, it implies that the object is a more recent collisional fragment. We discuss the implications of the unexpectedly faint magnitude and nuclear size of P/2008 R1 on the survival of ice inside very small bodies. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

We present a low-resolution Spitzer IRS search for [Ar II] at 6.98 $\mu$m, [Ne II] at 12.81 $\mu$m, and [Ne III] 15.55 $\mu$m lines in 56 transitional disks. These objects, characterized by reduced near-infrared but strong far-infrared excess emission, are ideal targets to set constraints on the stellar radiation field onto the disk because their spectra are not contaminated by shock emission from jets/outflows or by molecular emission lines. After demonstrating that we can detect [Ne II] lines and recover their fluxes from the low-resolution spectra, here we report the first detections of [Ar II] lines towards protoplanetary disks. We did not detect [Ne III] emission in any of our sources. Our [Ne II]/[Ne III] line flux ratios combined with literature data suggest that a soft-EUV or X-ray spectrum produces these gas lines. Furthermore, the [Ar II]/[Ne II] line flux ratios point to a soft X-ray and/or soft-EUV stellar spectrum as the ionization source of the [Ar II] and [Ne II] emitting layer of the disk. If the soft X-ray component dominates over the EUV than we would expect larger photoevaporation rates hence a reduction of the time available to form planets. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.3969;Planet Signatures in Collisionally Active Debris Discs: scattered light  images; Philippe Thebault,  Quentin Kral,  Steve Ertel;  Planet perturbations are often invoked as a potential explanation for many spatial structures that have been imaged in debris discs. So far this issue has been mostly investigated with collisionless N-body numerical models. We numerically investigate how the coupled effect of collisions and radiation pressure can affect the formation and survival of radial and azimutal structures in a disc perturbed by a planet. We consider two set-ups: a planet embedded within an extended disc and a planet exterior to an inner debris ring. We use the DyCoSS code of Thebault(2012) and derive synthetic images of the system in scattered light. The planet's mass and orbit, as well as the disc's collisional activity are explored as free parameters. We find that collisions always significantly damp planet-induced structures. For the case of an embedded planet, the planet's signature, mostly a density gap around its radial position, should remain detectable in head-on images if M_planet > M_Saturn. If the system is seen edge-on, however, inferring the presence of the planet is much more difficult, although some planet-induced signatures might be observable under favourable conditions. For the inner-ring/external-planet case, planetary perturbations cannot prevent collision-produced small fragments from populating the regions beyond the ring: The radial luminosity profile exterior to the ring is close to the one it should have in the absence of the planet. However, a Jovian planet on a circular orbit leaves precessing azimutal structures that can be used to indirectly infer its presence. For a planet on an eccentric orbit, the ring is elliptic and the pericentre glow effect is visible despite of collisions and radiation pressure, but detecting such features in real discs is not an unambiguous indicator of the presence of an outer planet. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

A low-resolution spectrum in the form of a color-color diagram of an exoplanet is likely to be one of the first post-detection quantities to be measured for the case of direct detection. In this paper, we explore potentially detectable surface features on rocky exoplanets and their connection to, and importance as, a habitat for extremophiles, as known on Earth. Extremophiles provide us with the minimum known envelope of environmental limits for life on our planet. The color of a planet reveals information on its properties, especially for surface features of rocky planets with clear atmospheres. We use filter photometry in the visible waveband as a first step in the characterization of rocky exoplanets to prioritize targets for follow-up spectroscopy. Many surface environments on Earth have characteristic albedos and occupy a different color space in the visible waveband (0.4-0.9 microns) that can be distinguished remotely. These detectable surface features can be linked to the extreme niches that support extremophiles on Earth and provide a link between geomicrobiology and observational astronomy. This paper explores how filter photometry can serve as a first step in characterizing Earth-like exoplanets for an aerobic as well as an anaerobic atmosphere, thereby prioritizing targets to search for atmospheric biosignatures.

Rafikov;"  We carry out local three dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic simulations of planet-disk interaction in stratified disks with varied thermodynamic properties. We find that whenever the Brunt-Vaisala frequency (N) in the disk is nonzero, the planet exerts a strong torque on the disk in the vicinity of the planet, with a reduction in the traditional ""torque cutoff"". In particular, this is true for adiabatic perturbations in disks with isothermal density structure, as should be typical for centrally irradiated protoplanetary disks. We identify this torque with buoyancy waves, which are excited (when N is non-zero) close to the planet, within one disk scale height from its orbit. These waves give rise to density perturbations with a characteristic 3D spatial pattern which is in close agreement with the linear dispersion relation for buoyancy waves. The torque due to these waves can amount to as much as several tens of per cent of the total planetary torque, which is not expected based on analytical calculations limited to axisymmetric or low-m modes. Buoyancy waves should be ubiquitous around planets in the inner, dense regions of protoplanetary disks, where they might possibly affect planet migration.

Takahashi,  Kento Masuda,  Yoichi Takeda,  Wako Aoki,  Motohide Tamura,  Yasushi Suto;"  We report a joint analysis of the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect with Subaru and the Kepler photometry for Kepler Object of Interest (KOI) 94 system. The system comprises four transiting planet candidates with orbital periods of 22.3 (KOI-94.01), 10.4 (KOI-94.02), 54.3 (KOI-94.03), and 3.7 (KOI-94.04) days from the Kepler photometry. We performed the radial velocity (RV) measurement of the system with the Subaru 8.2 m telescope on August 10, 2012 (UT), covering a complete transit of KOI-94.01 for $\sim 6.7$ hours. The resulting RV variation due to the RM effect spectroscopically confirms that KOI-94.01 is indeed the transiting planet, and implies that its orbital axis is well aligned with the stellar spin axis; the projected spin-orbit angle $\lambda$ is estimated as $-6_{-11}^{+13}$ deg. This is the first measurement of the RM effect for a multiple transiting system. Remarkably, the archived Kepler lightcurve around BJD=2455211.5 (date in UT January 14/15, 2010) indicates a ""ouble transit"" event of KOI-94.01 and KOI-94.03, in which the two planets transit the stellar disk simultaneously. Moreover, the two planets partially overlap each other, and exhibit a ""planet-planet eclipse"" around the transit center. This provides a rare opportunity to put tight constraints on the configuration of the two transiting planets by joint analysis with our Subaru RM measurement. Indeed, we find that the projected mutual inclination of KOI-94.01 and KOI-94.03 is estimated to be $\delta = -1.15 \pm 0.55$ deg.

We assume the worst possible scenario from the photobiological point of view: an already clear atmosphere with no ozone, as the timescale for soot and dust settling (years) is smaller than that of the full ozone regeneration (decades). Even in these conditions we show that most phytoplankton species would have had reasonable potential for photosynthesis in all the three main optical ocean water types. This modelling could help explain why the recovery of phytoplankton was relatively rapid after the huge environmental stress of that asteroid impact. In a more general scope, it also reminds us of the great resilience of the unicellular biosphere against huge environmental perturbations. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics (physics.ao-ph); Geophysics (physics.geo-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.4418;On the Direct Imaging of Tidally Heated Exomoons; Mary Anne Peters,  Edwin L. Turner;  We demonstrate the ability of existing and planned telescopes, on the ground and in space, to directly image tidally heated exomoons orbiting gas-giant exoplanets. Tidally heated exomoons can plausibly be far more luminous than their host exoplanet and as much as 0.1% as bright as the system's stellar primary if it is a low mass star. Because emission from exomoons can be powered by tidal forces, they can shine brightly at arbitrarily large separations from the system's stellar primary with temperatures of several hundreds degrees Kelvin or even higher in extreme cases. Furthermore, these high temperatures can occur in systems that are billions of years old. Tidally heated exomoons may thus be far easier targets for direct imaging studies than giant exoplanets which must be both young and at a large projected separation from their primary to be accessible to current generation direct imaging studies. For example, the (warm) Spitzer Space Telescope and the next generation of ground based instruments could detect an exomoon roughly the size of the Earth at a temperature ~600K and a distance ~5 parsecs. Future mid-infrared space telescopes, such as JWST and SPICA, will be capable of directly imaging tidally heated exomoons around the nearest two dozen stars with brightness temperature >300K and R>1R_earth orbiting at >12AU from the primary star at a 5sigma confidence level in a 10,000 second integration. In addition it is possible that some of the exoplanets which have already been directly imaged are actually tidally heated exomoons or blends of such objects with hot young planets. If such exomoons exist and are sufficiently common (i.e. nearby), it may well be far easier to directly image an exomoon with surface conditions that allow the existence of liquid water than it will be to resolve an Earth-like planet in the classical Habitable Zone of its primary. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.0269;The Role of Core Mass in Controlling Evaporation: the Kepler Radius  Distribution and the Kepler-36 Density Dichotomy; Eric Lopez,  Jonathan Fortney;"  We use models of coupled thermal evolution and photo-evaporative mass loss to understand the formation and evolution of the Kepler-36 system. We show that the large contrast in mean planetary density observed by Carter et al. (2012) can be explained as a natural consequence of photo-evaporation from planets that formed with similar initial compositions. However, rather than being due to differences in XUV irradiation between the planets, we find that this contrast is due to the difference in the masses of the planets' rock/iron cores and the impact that this has on mass loss evolution. We explore in detail how our coupled models depend on irradiation, mass, age, composition, and the efficiency of mass loss. Based on fits to large numbers of coupled evolution and mass loss runs, we provide analytic fits to understand threshold XUV fluxes for significant atmospheric loss, as a function of core mass and mass loss efficiency. Finally we discuss these results in the context of recent studies of the radius distribution of Kepler candidates. Using our parameter study, we make testable predictions for the frequency of sub-Neptune sized planets. We show that 1.8-4.0 R_earth planets should become significantly less common on orbits within 10 days and discuss the possibility of a narrow ""occurrence valley"" in the radius-flux distribution. Moreover, we describe how photo-evaporation provides a natural explanation for the recent observations of Ciardi et al. (2013) that inner planets are preferentially smaller within the systems.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.0307;Turbulence-Induced Relative Velocity of Dust Particles I: Identical  Particles; Liubin Pan,  Paolo Padoan;  We study the relative velocity of inertial particles suspended in turbulent flows and discuss implications for dust particle collisions in protoplanetary disks. We simulate a weakly compressible turbulent flow, evolving 14 particle species with friction timescale, tau_p, covering the entire range of scales in the flow. The particle Stokes numbers, St, measuring the ratio of tau_p to the Kolmogorov timescale, are in the range from ~0.1 to ~800. Using simulation results, we show that the model by Pan & Padoan (PP10) gives satisfactory predictions for the rms relative velocity between identical particles. The probability distribution function (PDF) of the relative velocity is found to be highly non-Gaussian. The PDF tails are well described by a 4/3 stretched exponential function for particles with tau_p ~ 1-2 T_L, where T_L is the Lagrangian correlation timescale, consistent with a prediction based on PP10. The PDF approaches Gaussian only for very large particles with tau_p >~ 54 T_L. We split particle pairs at given distances into two types with low and high relative speeds, referred to as continuous and caustic types, respectively, and compute their contributions to the collision kernel. Although amplified by the effect of clustering, the continuous contribution vanishes in the limit of infinitesimal particle distance, where the caustic contribution dominates. The caustic kernel per unit cross section rises rapidly as St increases toward ~1, reaches a maximum at tau_p ~ 2 T_L, and decreases as tau_p^{-1/2} for tau_p >> T_L. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)"

Duffard,  F. Henry,  P. Lacerda,  A. Barucci,  A. Gicquel;"  Transneptunian objects (TNOs) are bodies populating the Kuiper Belt and they are believed to retain the most pristine and least altered material of the solar system. The Herschel Open Time Key Program entitled ""TNOs are Cool: A survey of the trans-Neptunian region"" has been awarded 373 h to investigate the albedo, size distribution and thermal properties of TNOs and Centaurs. Here we focus on the brightest targets observed by both the PACS and SPIRE multiband photometers: the dwarf planet Haumea, six TNOs (Huya, Orcus, Quaoar, Salacia, 2002 UX25, and 2002 TC302), and two Centaurs (Chiron and Chariklo). Flux densities are derived from PACS and SPIRE instruments using optimised data reduction methods. The spectral energy distribution obtained with the Herschel PACS and SPIRE instruments over 6 bands (centred at 70, 100, 160, 250, 350, and 500 $\mu$m), and with Spitzer-MIPS at 23.7 and 71.4 $\mu$m has been modelled with the NEATM thermal model in order to derive the albedo, diameter, and beaming factor. For the Centaurs Chiron and Chariklo and for the 1000 km sized Orcus and Quaoar, a thermophysical model was also run to better constrain their thermal properties. We derive the size, albedo, and thermal properties, including thermal inertia and surface emissivity, for the 9 TNOs and Centaurs. Several targets show a significant decrease in their spectral emissivity longwards of $\sim$300 $\mu$m and especially at 500 $\mu$m. Using our size estimations and the mass values available in the literature, we also derive the bulk densities for the binaries Quaoar/Weywot (2.18$^{+0.43}_{-0.36}$ g/cm$^3$), Orcus/Vanth (1.53$^{+0.15}_{-0.13}$ g/cm$^3$), and Salacia/Actea (1.29$^{+0.29}_{-0.23}$ g/cm$^3$). Quaoar's density is similar to that of the other dwarf planets Pluto and Haumea, and its value implies high contents of refractory materials mixed with ices.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.0542;Observed Properties of Extrasolar Planets; Andrew W. Howard;  Observational surveys for extrasolar planets probe the diverse outcomes of planet formation and evolution. These surveys measure the frequency of planets with different masses, sizes, orbital characteristics, and host star properties. Small planets between the sizes of Earth and Neptune substantially outnumber Jupiter-sized planets. The survey measurements support the core accretion model in which planets form by the accumulation of solids and then gas in protoplanetary disks. The diversity of exoplanetary characteristics demonstrates that most of the gross features of the Solar system are one outcome in a continuum of possibilities. The most common class of planetary system detectable today consists of one or more planets approximately one to three times Earth's size orbiting within a fraction of the Earth-Sun distance. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.0578;Spectroscopy of Faint Kepler Mission Exoplanet Candidate Host Stars; Mark E. Everett,  Steve B. Howell,  David R. Silva,  Paula Szkody;  Stellar properties are measured for a large set of Kepler Mission exoplanet candidate host stars. Most of these stars are fainter than 14th magnitude, in contrast to other spectroscopic follow-up studies. This sample includes many high-priority Earth-sized candidate planets. A set of model spectra are fitted to R~3000 optical spectra of 268 stars to improve estimates of Teff, log(g), and [Fe/H] for the dwarfs in the range 4750K<Teff<7200K. These stellar properties are used to find new stellar radii and, in turn, new radius estimates for the candidate planets. The result of improved stellar characteristics is a more accurate representation of this Kepler exoplanet sample and identification of promising candidates for more detailed study. This stellar sample, particularly among stars with Teff>5200K, includes a greater number of relatively evolved stars with larger radii than assumed by the mission on the basis of multi-color broadband photometry. About 26% of the modelled stars require radii to be revised upwards by a factor of 1.35 or greater, and modelling of 87% of the stars suggest some increase in radius. The sample presented here also exhibits a change in the incidence of planets larger than 3-4 Earth radii as a function of metallicity. Once [Fe/H] increases to >=-0.05, large planets suddenly appear in the sample while smaller planets are found orbiting stars with a wider range of metallicity. The modelled stellar spectra, as well as an additional 84 stars of mostly lower effective temperatures, are made available to the community. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.0689;Photophoretic separation of metals and silicates: the formation of  Mercury like planets and metal depletion in chondrites; Gerhard Wurm,  Mario Trieloff,  Heike Rauer;  Mercury's high uncompressed mass density suggests that the planet is largely composed of iron, either bound within metal (mainly Fe-Ni), or iron sulfide. Recent results from the MESSENGER mission to Mercury imply a low temperature history of the planet which questions the standard formation models of impact mantle stripping or evaporation to explain the high metal content. Like Mercury, the two smallest extrasolar rocky planets with mass and size determination, CoRoT-7b and Kepler-10b, were found to be of high density. As they orbit close to their host stars this indicates that iron rich inner planets might not be a nuisance of the solar system but be part of a general scheme of planet formation. From undifferentiated chondrites it is also known that the metal to silicate ratio is highly variable which must be ascribed to pre-planetary fractionation processes. Due to this fractionation most chondritic parent bodies - most of them originated in the asteroid belt - are depleted in iron relative to average solar system abundances. The astrophysical processes leading to metal silicate fractionation in the solar nebula are essentially unknown. Here, we consider photophoretic forces. As these forces particularly act on irradiated solids, they might play a significant role for the composition of planetesimals forming at the inner edge of protoplanetary discs. Photophoresis can separate high thermal conductivity materials (iron) from lower thermal conductivity solids (silicate). We suggest that the silicates are preferentially pushed into the optical thick disk. Subsequent planetesimal formation at the edge moving outwards leads to metal rich planetesimals close to the star and metal depleted planetesimals further out in the nebula. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Turner (3),  Greg Abram (2) ((1) University of Texas at Dallas, (2) University of Texas at Austin, (3) Jet Propulsion Laboratory/California Institute of Technology);  Magnetorotational instability (MRI) is the most promising mechanism behind accretion in low-mass protostellar disks. Here we present the first analysis of the global structure and evolution of non-ideal MRI-driven T-Tauri disks on million-year timescales. We accomplish this in a 1+1D simulation by calculating magnetic diffusivities and utilizing turbulence activity criteria to determine thermal structure and accretion rate without resorting to a 3-D magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulation. Our major findings are as follows. First, even for modest surface densities of just a few times the minimum-mass solar nebula, the dead zone encompasses the giant planet-forming region, preserving any compositional gradients. Second, the surface density of the active layer is nearly constant in time at roughly 10 g/cm2, which we use to derive a simple prescription for viscous heating in MRI-active disks for those who wish to avoid detailed MHD computations. Furthermore, unlike a standard disk with constant-alpha viscosity, the disk midplane does not cool off over time, though the surface cools as the star evolves along the Hayashi track. The ice line is firmly in the terrestrial planet-forming region throughout disk evolution and can move either inward or outward with time, depending on whether pileups form near the star. Finally, steady-state mass transport is a poor description of flow through an MRI-active disk. We caution that MRI activity is sensitive to many parameters, including stellar X-ray flux, grain size, gas/small grain mass ratio and magnetic field strength, and we have not performed an exhaustive parameter study here. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Fortney,  Nikole K. Lewis,  Nicolas B. Cowan,  Eric Agol,  Jean-Michel Desert,  Pedro V. Sada,  David Charbonneau,  Gregory Laughlin,  Jonathan Langton,  Adam P. Showman;  We present Warm Spitzer/IRAC secondary eclipse time series photometry of three short-period transiting exoplanets, HAT-P-3b, HAT-P-4b and HAT-P-12b, in both the available 3.6 and 4.5 micron bands. HAT-P-3b and HAT-P-4b are Jupiter-mass, objects orbiting an early K and an early G dwarf stars, respectively. For HAT-P-3b we find eclipse depths of 0.112%+0.015%-0.030% (3.6 micron) and 0.094%+0.016%-0.009% (4.5 micron). The HAT-P-4b values are 0.142%+0.014%-0.016% (3.6 micron) and 0.122%+0.012%-0.014% (4.5micron). The two planets' photometry is consistent with inefficient heat redistribution from their day to night sides (and low albedos), but it is inconclusive about possible temperature inversions in their atmospheres. HAT-P-12b is a Saturn-mass planet and is one of the coolest planets ever observed during secondary eclipse, along with hot Neptune GJ 436b and hot Saturn WASP-29b. We are able to place 3$\sigma$ upper limits on the secondary eclipse depth of HAT-P-12b in both wavelengths: < 0.042% (3.6 micron) and <0.085% (4.5 micron). We discuss these results in the context of the {\it Spitzer} secondary eclipse measurements of GJ 436b and WASP-29b. It is possible that we do not detect the eclipses of HAT-P-12b due to high eccentricity, but find that weak planetary emission in these wavelengths is a more likely explanation. We place 3 sigma upper limits on the |e cos(omega)| quantity (where e is eccentricity and omega is the argument of periapsis) for HAT-P-3b (<0.0081) and HAT-P-4b (<0.0042), based on the secondary eclipse timings. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Sanchez,  Christopher T. Russell,  Robert Gaskell,  Carol Raymond;  The surface composition of Vesta, the most massive intact basaltic object in the asteroid belt, is interesting because it provides us with an insight into magmatic differentiation of planetesimals that eventually coalesced to form the terrestrial planets. The distribution of lithologic and compositional units on the surface of Vesta provides important constraints on its petrologic evolution, impact history and its relationship with Vestoids and howardite-eucrite-diogenite (HED) meteorites. Using color parameters (band tilt and band curvature) originally developed for analyzing lunar data, we have identified and mapped HED terrains on Vesta in Dawn Framing Camera (FC) color data. The average color spectrum of Vesta is identical to that of howardite regions, suggesting an extensive mixing of surface regolith due to impact gardening over the course of solar system history. Our results confirm the hemispherical dichotomy (east-west and north-south) in albedo/color/composition that has been observed by earlier studies. The presence of diogenite-rich material in the southern hemisphere suggests that it was excavated during the formation of the Rheasilvia and Veneneia basins. Our lithologic mapping of HED regions provides direct evidence for magmatic evolution of Vesta with diogenite units in Rheasilvia forming the lower crust of a differentiated object. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.0980;Deuterium Burning in Massive Giant Planets and Low-Mass Brown Dwarfs  formed by Core-Nucleated Accretion; Peter Bodenheimer,  Gennaro D'Angelo,  Jack J. Lissauer,  Jonathan J. Fortney,  Didier Saumon;  Formation of bodies near the deuterium-burning limit is considered by detailed numerical simulations according to the core-nucleated giant planet accretion scenario. The objects, with heavy-element cores in the range 5-30 Mearth, are assumed to accrete gas up to final masses of 10-15 Jupiter masses (Mjup). After the formation process, which lasts 1-5 Myr and which ends with a 'cold-start', low-entropy configuration, the bodies evolve at constant mass up to an age of several Gyr. Deuterium burning via proton capture is included in the calculation, and we determined the mass, M50, above which more than 50% of the initial deuterium is burned. This often-quoted borderline between giant planets and brown dwarfs is found to depend only slightly on parameters, such as core mass, stellar mass, formation location, solid surface density in the protoplanetary disk, disk viscosity, and dust opacity. The values for M50 fall in the range 11.6-13.6 Mjup, in agreement with previous determinations that do not take the formation process into account. For a given opacity law during the formation process, objects with higher core masses form more quickly. The result is higher entropy in the envelope at the completion of accretion, yielding lower values of M50. For masses above M50, during the deuterium-burning phase, objects expand and increase in luminosity by 1 to 3 orders of magnitude. Evolutionary tracks in the luminosity-versus-time diagram are compared with the observed position of the companion to Beta Pictoris. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.1298;A Posteriori Transit Probabilities; Daniel J. Stevens,  B. Scott Gaudi;  Typically, when estimating the prior transit probability, one assumes a uniform distribution for the cosine of the inclination angle i of the companion's orbit, which yields the familiar estimate of ~R_*/a. However, the posterior transit probability depends not only on the prior probability distribution of i but also on the prior probability distribution of the companion mass M_c. In general, the posterior can be larger or smaller than the prior transit probability. We derive analytic expressions for the posterior transit probability assuming a power-law form for the distribution of true masses with exponent alpha. For low transit probabilities, these probabilities reduce to a constant multiplicative factor of the corresponding prior transit probability. The prior and posterior probabilities are equal for alpha = -1, whereas the posterior transit probability is ~1.5 times larger and ~4/pi larger for for alpha = -3 and alpha = -2, but is less than the prior for alpha >= 0, and can be arbitrarily small for alpha > 1. We also calculate the posterior transit probability in different mass regimes for two physically-motivated mass distributions of companions around Sun-like stars, finding that the posterior is likely higher for Super-Earths, Neptunes and Super-Jupiters. We therefore suggest that companions with minimum masses in these regimes might be better-than-expected targets for transit follow-up, and we identify promising targets from RV-detected planets in the literature. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.1322;Accretion of gas onto gap-opening planets and circumplanetary flow  structure in magnetized turbulent disks; Ana Uribe,  Hubert Klahr,  Thomas Henning;  We have performed three-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamical simulations of stellar accretion disks, using the PLUTO code, and studied the accretion of gas onto a Jupiter-mass planet and the structure of the circumplanetary gas flow after opening a gap in the disk. We compare our results with simulations of laminar, yet viscous disks with different levels of an $\alpha$-type viscosity. In all cases, we find that the accretion flow across the surface of the Hill sphere of the planet is not spherically or azimuthally symmetric, and is predominantly restricted to the mid-plane region of the disk. Even in the turbulent case, we find no significant vertical flow of mass into the Hill sphere. The outer parts of the circumplanetary disk are shown to rotate significantly below Keplerian speed, independent of viscosity, while the circumplanetary disk density (therefore the angular momentum) increases with viscosity. For a simulation of a magnetized turbulent disk, where the global averaged alpha stress is $\alpha_{MHD}=10^{-3}$, we find the accretion rate onto the planet to be $\dot{M}\approx 2\times10^{-6}M_{J}yr^{-1}$ for a gap surface density of $12 g cm^{-2}$. This is about a third of the accretion rate obtained in a laminar viscous simulation with equivalent $\alpha$ parameter. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.1413;The dynamical evolution of multi-planet systems in open clusters; W. Hao,  M.B.N. Kouwenhoven,  R. Spurzem;  The majority of stars form in star clusters and many are thought to have planetary companions. We demonstrate that multi-planet systems are prone to instabilities as a result of frequent stellar encounters in these star clusters much more than single-planet systems. The cumulative effect of close and distant encounters on these planetary systems are investigated using Monte Carlo scattering experiments. We consider two types of planetary configurations orbiting Sun-like stars: (i) five Jupiter-mass planets in the semi-major axis range 1-42 AU orbiting a Solar mass star, with orbits that are initially co-planar, circular, and separated by 10 mutual Hill radii, and (ii) the four gas giants of our Solar system. Planets with short orbital periods are not directly affected by encountering stars. However, secular evolution of perturbed systems may result in the ejection of the innermost planets or in physical collisions of the innermost planets with the host star, up to many thousands of years after a stellar encounter. The simulations of the Solar system-like systems indicate that Saturn, Uranus and Neptune are affected by both direct interactions with encountering stars, as well as planet-planet scattering. Jupiter, on the other hand, is almost only affected by direct encounters with neighbouring stars, as its mass is too large to be substantially perturbed by the other three planets. Our results indicate that stellar encounters can account for the apparent scarcity of exoplanets in star clusters, not only for those on wide-orbit that are directly affected by stellar encounters, but also planets close to the star which can disappear long after a stellar encounter has perturbed the planetary system. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Grav,  C. R. Nugent,  R. Stevenson;  Using albedos from WISE/NEOWISE to separate distinct albedo groups within the Main Belt asteroids, we apply the Hierarchical Clustering Method to these subpopulations and identify dynamically associated clusters of asteroids. While this survey is limited to the ~35% of known Main Belt asteroids that were detected by NEOWISE, we present the families linked from these objects as higher confidence associations than can be obtained from dynamical linking alone. We find that over one-third of the observed population of the Main Belt is represented in the high-confidence cores of dynamical families. The albedo distribution of family members differs significantly from the albedo distribution of background objects in the same region of the Main Belt, however interpretation of this effect is complicated by the incomplete identification of lower-confidence family members. In total we link 38,298 asteroids into 76 distinct families. This work represents a critical step necessary to debias the albedo and size distributions of asteroids in the Main Belt and understand the formation and history of small bodies in our Solar system. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

The observations were made with the WIRCam instrument on the CFHT. We obtained a secondary eclipse depth of 0.103$_{-0.017}^{+0.017}%$ and 0.194$_{-0.029}^{+0.029}%$ in the H and Ks-bands, respectively. The Ks band depth is consistent with previous measurement in the narrow band centered at 2.09um by Gillon et al. (2012). Our eclipse depths in both bands are consistent with a blackbody spectrum with a temperature of ~1850 K, slightly higher than the dayside equilibrium temperature without day-night energy redistribution. Based on theoretical models of the dayside atmosphere of WASP-43b, our data constrain the day-night energy redistribution in the planet to be $\lesssim 15-25$%, depending on the metal content in the atmosphere. Combined with energy balance arguments our data suggest that a strong temperature inversion is unlikely in the dayside atmosphere of WASP-43b. However, a weak inversion cannot be strictly ruled out at the current time. Future observations are required to place detailed constraints on the chemical composition of the atmosphere. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.1662;Plutino Detection Biases, Including the Kozai Resonance; S. M. Lawler,  B. Gladman;"  Because of their proximity within the transneptunian region, the plutinos (objects in the 3:2 mean-motion resonance with Neptune) are numerous in flux-limited catalogs, and well-studied theoretically. We perform detailed modelling of the on-sky detection biases for plutinos, with special attention to those that are simultaneously in the Kozai resonance. In addition to the normal 3:2 resonant argument libration, Kozai plutinos also show periodic oscillations in eccentricity and inclination, coupled to the argument of perihelion (omega) oscillation. Due to the mean-motion resonance, plutinos avoid coming to pericenter near Neptune's current position in the ecliptic plane. Because Kozai plutinos are restricted to certain values of omega, perihelion always occurs out of the ecliptic plane, biasing ecliptic surveys against finding these objects. The observed Kozai plutino fraction (fkoz) has been measured by several surveys, finding values between 8% and 25%, while the true fkoz has been predicted to be between 10% and 30% by different giant planet migration simulations. We show that the observed fkoz varies widely depending on the ecliptic latitude and longitude of the survey, so debiasing to find the true ratio is complex. Even a survey that covers most or all of the sky will detect an apparent Kozai fraction that is different from the true fkoz. We present a map of the on-sky plutino Kozai fraction that would be detected by all-sky flux-limited surveys. This will be especially important for the Panoramic Survey Telescope & Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS) and Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) projects, which may detect large numbers of plutinos as they sweep the sky. The Kozai fraction and the distribution of the orbital elements of Kozai plutinos may be a diagnostic of giant planet migration; future migration simulations should provide details on their resonant Kozai populations.

Additionally, the recent discovery of stellar binary companions ~1"" from WASP-12 has obfuscated interpretation of the observational data. Here we present new ground-based multi-object transmission-spectroscopy observations of WASP-12b that we acquired over two consecutive nights in the red optical with Gemini-N/GMOS. After correcting for the influence of WASP-12's stellar companions, we find that these data rule out a cloud-free, H2 atmosphere with no additional opacity sources. We detect features in the transmission spectrum that may be attributed to metal oxides (such as TiO and VO) for an O-rich atmosphere or to metal hydrides (such as TiH) for a C-rich atmosphere. We also reanalyzed NIR transit-spectroscopy observations of WASP-12b from HST/WFC3 and broadband transit photometry from Warm Spitzer. We attribute the broad spectral features in the WFC3 data to either H2O or CH4 and HCN for an O-rich or C-rich atmosphere, respectively. The Spitzer data suggest shallower transit depths than the models predict at infrared wavelengths, albeit at low statistical significance. A multi-instrument, broad-wavelength analysis of WASP-12b suggests that the transmission spectrum is well approximated by a simple Rayleigh scattering model with a planet terminator temperature of 1870 +/- 130 K. We conclude that additional high-precision data and isolated spectroscopic measurements of the companion stars are required to place definitive constraints on the composition of WASP-12b's atmosphere.

Planet-planet scattering (PPS) between giant planets is a possible mechanism in interpreting above and other observed properties. If the observed giant planet architectures are indeed the outcomes of PPS, such drastic dynamical process must affect their primordial moon systems. In this Letter, we discuss the effect of the PPS on the survival of their regular moons. From the viewpoint of observations, some preliminary conclusions are drawn from the simulations. 1. PPS is a destructive process to the moon systems, single planets on eccentric orbits are not the ideal moon-search targets. 2. If hot Jupiters formed through PPS, their original moons have little chance to survive. 3. Planets in multiple systems with small eccentricities are more likely holding their primordial moons. 4. Compared to the lower-mass planets, the massive ones in multiple systems may not be the preferred moon-search targets if the system underwent a PPS history. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.1889;The Fate of Planetesimals in Turbulent Disks with Dead Zones. I. The  Turbulent Stirring Recipe; Satoshi Okuzumi,  Chris W. Ormel;  Turbulence in protoplanetary disks affects planet formation in many ways. While small dust particles are mainly affected by the aerodynamical coupling with turbulent gas velocity fields, planetesimals and larger bodies are more affected by gravitational interaction with gas density fluctuations. For the latter process, a number of numerical simulations have been performed in recent years, but a fully parameter-independent understanding has not been yet established. In this study, we present simple scaling relations for the planetesimal stirring rate in turbulence driven by magnetorotational instability (MRI), taking into account the stabilization of MRI due to Ohmic resistivity. We begin with order-of-magnitude estimates of the turbulence-induced gravitational force acting on solid bodies and associated diffusion coefficients for their orbital elements. We then test the predicted scaling relations using the results of recent Ohmic-resistive MHD simulations by Gressel et al. We find that these relations successfully explain the simulation results if we properly fix order-of-unity uncertainties within the estimates. We also update the saturation predictor for the density fluctuation amplitude in MRI-driven turbulence originally proposed by Okuzumi & Hirose. Combination of the scaling relations and saturation predictor allows to know how the turbulent stirring rate of planetesimals depends on disk parameters such as the gas column density, distance from the central star, vertical resistivity distribution, and net vertical magnetic flux. In Paper II, we apply our recipe to planetesimal accretion to discuss its viability in turbulent disks. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)"

During runaway growth bodies in the 0.1--100 km size range (planetesimals) quickly produce a number of much larger seeds. The runaway growth phase is essential for planet formation as the emergent planetary embryos can accrete the leftover planetesimals at large gravitational focusing factors. However, torques resulting from turbulence-induced density fluctuations may violate the criterion for the onset of runaway growth, which is that the magnitude of the planetesimals' random (eccentric) motions are less than their escape velocity. This condition represents a more stringent constraint than the condition that planetesimals survive their mutual collisions. To investigate the effects of MRI turbulence on the viability of the runaway growth scenario, we apply our semi-analytical recipes of Paper I, which we augment by a coagulation/fragmentation model for the dust component. We find that the surface area-equivalent abundance of 0.1 micron particles is reduced by factors 10^2--10^3, which tends to render the dust irrelevant to the turbulence. We express the turbulent activity in the midplane regions in terms of a size s_run above which planetesimals will experience runaway growth. We find that s_run is mainly determined by the strength of the vertical net field that threads the disks and the disk radius. At disk radii beyond 5 AU, s_run becomes larger than ~100 km and the collision times among these bodies longer than the duration of the nebula phase. Our findings imply that the classical, planetesimal-dominated, model for planet formation is not viable in the outer regions of a turbulent disk. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Paul Butler,  Jeffrey D. Crane,  Stephen A. Shectman,  Ian Thompson,  Sebastian Wende,  Dante Minniti;  We report two low mass companions orbiting the nearby K7 dwarf GJ 221 that have emerged from re-analyzing 4.4 years of publicly available HARPS spectra complemented with 2 years of high precision Doppler measurements with Magellan/PFS. The HARPS measurements alone contain the clear signal of a low mass companion with a period of 125 days and a minimum mass of 53.2 \mearth (GJ 221b), falling in a mass range where very few planet candidates have been found (sub-Saturn desert). The addition of 17 PFS observations allow the confident detection of a second low mass companion (6.5 \mearth) in a hot orbit (3.87 days period, GJ 221c). Spectrocopic and photometric calibrations suggest that GJ 221 is slightly depleted ([Fe/H]$\sim$ -0.1) compared to the Sun so the presence of two low mass companions in the system confirms the trend that slightly reduced stellar metallicity does not prevent the formation of planets in the super-Earth to sub-Saturn mass regime. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.2211;In Situ Measurements of the Size and Density of Titan Aerosol Analogues; Sarah M. Horst,  Margaret A. Tolbert;  The organic haze produced from complex CH4/N2 chemistry in the atmosphere of Titan plays an important role in processes that occur in the atmosphere and on its surface. The haze particles act as condensation nuclei and are therefore involved in Titan's methane hydrological cycle. They also may behave like sediment on Titan's surface and participate in both fluvial and aeolian processes. Models that seek to understand these processes require information about the physical properties of the particles including their size and density. Although measurements obtained by Cassini-Huygens have placed constraints on the size of the haze particles, their densities remain unknown. We have conducted a series of Titan atmosphere simulation experiments and measured the size, number density, and particle density of Titan aerosol analogues, or tholins, for CH4 concentrations from 0.01% to 10% using two different energy sources, spark discharge and UV. We find that the densities currently in use by many Titan models are higher than the measured densities of our tholins. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.2222;STIS Coronagraphic Imaging of Fomalhaut: Main Belt Structure and the  Orbit of Fomalhaut b; Paul Kalas,  James R. Graham,  Michael P. Fitzgerald,  Mark Clampin;  We present new optical coronagraphic data of the bright star Fomalhaut obtained with the HST in 2010/2012 using STIS. Fomalhaut b is recovered at both epochs to high significance. The observations include the discoveries of tenuous nebulosity beyond the main dust belt detected to at least 209 AU projected radius and a ~50 AU wide azimuthal gap in the belt northward of Fom b. The morphology of Fomalhaut b appears elliptical in the STIS detections. We show that residual noise in the processed data can plausibly result in point sources appearing extended. A MCMC analysis demonstrates that the orbit of Fom b is highly eccentric, with e=0.8+/-0.1, a=177+/-68 AU, and q = 32+/-24 AU. Fom b is apsidally aligned with the belt and 90% of allowed orbits have mutual inclination 36 deg or less. Fomalhaut b's orbit is belt-crossing in projection, but only 12% of possible orbits have nodes within a 25 AU wide belt annulus (133-158 AU). The high e invokes a dynamical history where Fom b may have experienced a significant dynamical interaction with a hypothetical planet Fomalhaut c, and the current orbital configuration may be relatively short-lived. The new value for the periastron distance diminishes the Hill radius of Fom b and any weakly bound satellite system surrounding a planet would be sheared and dynamically heated at periapse. We argue that Fom b's minimum mass is that of a dwarf planet in order for a circumplanetary satellite system to remain bound to a sufficient radius from the planet to be consistent with the dust scattered light hypothesis. Fom b may be optically bright because the recent passage through periapse and/or the ascending node has increased the erosion rates of planetary satellites. In the coplanar case, Fomalhaut b will collide with the main belt around 2032, and the subsequent emergent phenomena may help determine its physical nature. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Thomas,  the CHEOPS team;  Ground based radial velocity (RV) searches continue to discover exoplanets below Neptune mass down to Earth mass. Furthermore, ground based transit searches now reach milli-mag photometric precision and can discover Neptune size planets around bright stars. These searches will find exoplanets around bright stars anywhere on the sky, their discoveries representing prime science targets for further study due to the proximity and brightness of their host stars. A mission for transit follow-up measurements of these prime targets is currently lacking. The first ESA S-class mission CHEOPS (CHaracterizing ExoPlanet Satellite) will fill this gap. It will perform ultra-high precision photometric monitoring of selected bright target stars almost anywhere on the sky with sufficient precision to detect Earth sized transits. It will be able to detect transits of RV-planets by photometric monitoring if the geometric configuration results in a transit. For Hot Neptunes discovered from the ground, CHEOPS will be able to improve the transit light curve so that the radius can be determined precisely. Because of the host stars' brightness, high precision RV measurements will be possible for all targets. All planets observed in transit by CHEOPS will be validated and their masses will be known. This will provide valuable data for constraining the mass-radius relation of exoplanets, especially in the Neptune-mass regime. During the planned 3.5 year mission, about 500 targets will be observed. There will be 20% of open time available for the community to develop new science programmes. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.2454;Flux Enhancement of Slow-moving Particles by Sun or Jupiter: Can they be  Detected on Earth?; Bijunath R. Patla,  Robert J. Nemiroff,  Dieter H. H. Hoffmann,  Konstantin Zioutas;  Slow-moving particles capable of interacting solely with gravity might be detected on Earth as a result of the gravitational lensing induced focusing action of the Sun. The deflection experienced by these particles are inversely proportional to the square of their velocities and as a result their focal lengths will be shorter. We investigate the velocity dispersion of these slow-moving particles, originating from distant point-like sources, for imposing upper and lower bounds on the velocities of such particles in order for them to be focused onto Earth. We find that fluxes of such slow-moving and non-interacting particles must have speeds between ~0.01 and ~0.14 times the speed of light, $c$. Particles with speeds less than ~0.01 c will undergo way too much deflection to be focused, although such individual particles could be detected. At the caustics, the magnification factor could be as high as ~10E+6. We impose lensing constraints on the mass of these particles in order for them to be detected with large flux enhancements to be greater than E-9 eV. An approximate mass density profile for Jupiter is used to constrain particle velocities for lensing by Jupiter. We show that Jupiter could potentially focus particles with speeds as low as ~0.001c, which the Sun cannot. As a special case, the perfect alignment of the planet Jupiter with the Sun is also considered. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.2570;Shock jump relations for a dusty gas atmosphere; R. K. Anand;  This paper presents generalized forms of jump relations for one dimensional shock waves propagating in a dusty gas. The dusty gas is assumed to be a mixture of a perfect gas and spherically small solid particles, in which solid particle are continuously distributed. The generalized jump relations reduce to the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions for shocks in an idea gas when the mass fraction (concentration) of solid particles in the mixture becomes zero. The jump relations for pressure, density, temperature, particle velocity, and change-in-entropy across the shock front are derived in terms of upstream Mach number. Finally, the useful forms of the shock jump relations for weak and strong shocks, respectively, are obtained in terms of the initial volume fraction of the solid particles. The computations have been performed for various values of mass concentration of the solid particles and for the ratio of density of solid particles to the constant initial density of gas. Tables and graphs of numerical results are presented and discussed. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.2621;The location of Asteroidal Belt Comets (ABCs), in a comets' evolutionary  diagram: The Lazarus Comets; Ignacio Ferrin,  Jorge Zuluaga,  Pablo Cuartas;  There is a group of newly recognized asteroids in the main belt that are exhibiting cometary characteristics. We will call them Asteroidal Belt Comets or ABCs. An analysis of their orbital and physical properties has resulted in the following conclusion: (1) We define the detached group, DG, as objects sublimating water that have aphelion distances Q < 4.5 AU. The detached group contains all the ABCs traditionally recognized, plus a few other members like 2P and 107P. With the above definition there are 11 members of the ABC group: 2P, 107P, 133P, 176P, 233P, 238P, C/2008 R1, C/2010 R2, 2011 CR42, 3200, and 300163 = 2006 VW139. (2) Active objects sublimate ices except collisioned asteroids, CA, P/2010 A2, 596 Scheila, and P/2012 F5 Gibbs, and 3200 Phaethon who was active due to sputtering. (3)We have calibrated the black body (color) temperature of comets vs perihelion distance, R. We find T = 325+-5 K/SQRT(R). (4) Using a mathematical model of the thermal wave we calculate the thickness of the dust layer on comet nuclei as 2.0+-0.5 m for comet 107P, 4.7+-1.2 m for comet 133P and 1.9+-0.5 m for a sample of 9 comets. (5) We have located three ABCs in an evolutionary diagram of Remaining Revolutions, RR, vs Water-Budget Age, WB-AGE. ABCs lie together in the upper right hand corner of the diagram. (6) RR vs WB-AGE defines the region of the graveyard of comets, objects with 1000 cy < WB-AGE (cy stands for comet years). Five members belong to the graveyard, 107P, 133P, 2006 VW139, D/1891 W1 Blanpain and 3200 Phaeton. Thus we propose that the asteroidal belt contains an enormous graveyard of ancient dormant and extinct rocky comets, that turn on (are rejuvenated), in response to a diminution of their perihelion distance. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.2629;Bulk Composition of GJ 1214b and other sub-Neptune exoplanets; Diana Valencia,  Tristan Guillot,  Vivien Parmentier,  Richard S. Freedman;  GJ1214b stands out among the detected low-mass exoplanets, because it is, so far, the only one amenable to transmission spectroscopy. Up to date there is no consensus about the composition of its envelope although most studies suggest a high molecular weight atmosphere. In particular, it is unclear if hydrogen and helium are present or if the atmosphere is water dominated. Here, we present results on the composition of the envelope obtained by using an internal structure and evolutionary model to fit the mass and radius data. By examining all possible mixtures of water and H/He, with the corresponding opacities, we find that the bulk amount of H/He of GJ1214b is at most 7% by mass. In general, we find the radius of warm sub-Neptunes to be most sensitive to the amount of H/He. We note that all (Kepler-11b,c,d,f, Kepler-18b, Kepler-20b, 55Cnc-e, Kepler-36c and Kepler-68b) but two (Kepler-11e and Kepler-30b) of the discovered low-mass planets so far have less than 10% H/He. In fact, Kepler-11e and Kepler-30b have 10-18% and 5-15% bulk H/He. Conversely, little can be determined about the H2O or rocky content of sub-Neptune planets. We find that although a 100% water composition fits the data for GJ1214b, based on formation constraints the presence of heavier refractory material on this planet is expected, and hence, so is a component lighter than water required. A robust determination by transmission spectroscopy of the composition of the upper atmosphere of GJ1214b will help determine the extent of compositional segregation between the atmosphere and envelope. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Leinert;  We investigate the structure of the innermost region of three circumstellar disks around pre-main sequence stars HD 142666, AS 205 N, and AS 205 S. We determine the inner radii of the dust disks and, in particular, search for transition objects where dust has been depleted and inner disk gaps have formed at radii of a few tenths of AU up to several AU. We performed interferometric observations with IOTA, AMBER, and MIDI in the infrared wavelength ranges 1.6-2.5um and 8-13um with projected baseline lengths between 25m and 102m. The data analysis was based on radiative transfer simulations in 3D models of young stellar objects (YSOs) to reproduce the spectral energy distribution and the interferometric visibilities simultaneously. Accretion effects and disk gaps could be considered in the modeling approach. Results from previous studies restricted the parameter space. The objects of this study were spatially resolved in the infrared wavelength range using the interferometers. Based on these observations, a disk gap could be found for the source HD 142666 that classifies it as transition object. There is a disk hole up to a radius of R_in=0.30AU and a (dust-free) ring between 0.35AU and 0.80AU in the disk of HD 142666. The classification of AS 205 as a system of classical T Tauri stars could be confirmed using the canonical model approach, i. e., there are no hints of disk gaps in our observations. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.2821;Introducing the Eulalia and new Polana asteroid families: re-assessing  primitive asteroid families in the inner Main Belt; Kevin J. Walsh,  Marco DelbÃ³,  William F. Bottke,  David VokrouhlickÃ½,  Dante S. Lauretta;  The so-called Nysa-Polana complex of asteroids is a diverse and widespread group. It appears to be two overlapping families of different asteroid taxonomies: (44) Nysa is an E-type asteroid with the lowest number in the midst of a predominantly S-type cluster and (142) Polana is a B-type asteroid near the low-albedo B- and C-type cluster. Using the data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) mission we have re-analyzed the region around the Nysa-Polana complex in the inner Main Belt, focusing on the low-albedo population. (142) Polana does not appear to be a member of the family of low-albedo asteroids in the Nysa-Polana complex. Rather, the largest is asteroid (495) Eulalia. This asteroid has never before been linked to this complex for an important dynamical reason: it currently has a proper eccentricity slightly below the range of most of the family members. However, its orbit is very close to the 3:1 mean motion resonance with Jupiter and is in a weak secular resonance. We show that its osculating eccentricity varies widely on short timescales and the averaged value diffuses over long timescales. The diffusive orbit, low-albedo, taxonomic similarity and semimajor axis strongly suggests that despite its current proper eccentricity, (495) Eulalia could have recently been at an orbit very central to the family. Hierarchical Clustering Method tests confirm that at an eccentricity of e=0.15, (495) Eulalia could be the parent of the family. The ``Eulalia family'' was formed between 900--1500 Myr ago, and likely resulted from the breakup of a 100--160 km parent body. There is also compelling evidence for an older and more widespread primitive family in the same region of the asteroid belt parented by asteroid (142) Polana. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.2825;A resonant family of dynamically cold small bodies in the near-Earth  asteroid belt; C. de la Fuente Marcos,  R. de la Fuente Marcos;  Near-Earth objects (NEOs) moving in resonant, Earth-like orbits are potentially important. On the positive side, they are the ideal targets for robotic and human low-cost sample return missions and a much cheaper alternative to using the Moon as an astronomical observatory. On the negative side and even if small in size (2-50 m), they have an enhanced probability of colliding with the Earth causing local but still significant property damage and loss of life. Here, we show that the recently discovered asteroid 2013 BS45 is an Earth co-orbital, the sixth horseshoe librator to our planet. In contrast with other Earth's co-orbitals, its orbit is strikingly similar to that of the Earth yet at an absolute magnitude of 25.8, an artificial origin seems implausible. The study of the dynamics of 2013 BS45 coupled with the analysis of NEO data show that it is one of the largest and most stable members of a previously undiscussed dynamically cold group of small NEOs experiencing repeated trappings in the 1:1 commensurability with the Earth. This new resonant family is well constrained in orbital parameter space and it includes at least 10 other transient members: 2003 YN107, 2006 JY26, 2009 SH2 and 2012 FC71 among them. 2012 FC71 represents the best of both worlds as it is locked in a Kozai resonance and is unlikely to impact the Earth.

The system is famous for showing the dust properties of a debris disk, but the gas properties of a low-mass protoplanetary disk. The data were acquired with the Herschel Space Observatory PACS and SPIRE instruments, largely as part of the ""Gas in Protoplanetary Systems"" (GASPS) Open Time Key Programme. Disk dust emission is detected in images at 70, 160, 250, 350, and 500 \mu m; 49 Cet is significantly extended in the 70 \mu m image, spatially resolving the outer dust disk for the first time. Spectra covering small wavelength ranges centered on eight atomic and molecular emission lines were obtained, including [OI] 63 \mu m and [CII] 158 \mu m. The CII line was detected at the 5\sigma\ level - the first detection of atomic emission from the disk. No other emission lines were seen, despite the fact that the OI line is the brightest one observed in Herschel protoplanetary disk spectra (Meeus et al. 2012; Dent et al. 2013). We present an estimate of the amount of circumstellar atomic gas implied by the CII emission. The new far-IR/sub-mm data fills in a large gap in the previous spectral energy distribution (SED) of 49 Cet. A simple model of the new SED confirms the two-component structure of the disk: warm inner dust and cold outer dust that produces most of the observed excess. Finally, we discuss preliminary thermochemical modeling of the 49 Cet gas/dust disk and our attempts to match several observational results simultaneously. Although we are not yet successful in doing so, our investigations shed light on the evolutionary status of the 49 Cet gas, which might not be primordial gas but rather secondary gas coming from comets.

Gelino;  Transiting planets have greatly expanded and diversified the exoplanet field. These planets provide greater access to characterization of exoplanet atmospheres and structure. The Kepler mission has been particularly successful in expanding the exoplanet inventory, even to planets smaller than the Earth. The orbital period sensitivity of the Kepler data is now extending into the Habitable Zones of their host stars, and several planets larger than the Earth have been found to lie therein. Here we examine one such proposed planet, Kepler-69c. We provide new orbital parameters for this planet and an in-depth analysis of the Habitable Zone. We find that, even under optimistic conditions, this 1.7 R$_\oplus$ planet is unlikely to be within the Habitable Zone of Kepler-69. Furthermore, the planet receives an incident flux of 1.91 times the solar constant, which is similar to that received by Venus. We thus suggest that this planet is likely a super-Venus rather than a super-Earth in terms of atmospheric properties and habitability, and we propose follow-up observations to disentangle the ambiguity. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.3109;A thermophysical analysis of the (1862) Apollo Yarkovsky and YORP  effects; Ben Rozitis,  Sam R. Duddy,  Simon F. Green,  Stephen C. Lowry;  Near-Earth asteroid (1862) Apollo has strong detections of both orbital semimajor axis drift and rotational acceleration. We produce a unified model that can accurately match both observed effects using a single set of thermophysical properties derived from ground-based observations, and we determine Apollo's long term evolution. We use light-curve shape inversion techniques and the ATPM on published light-curve, thermal-infrared, and radar observations to constrain Apollo's thermophysical properties. The derived properties are used to make detailed predictions of Apollo's Yarkovsky and YORP effects, which are then compared with published measurements of orbital drift and rotational acceleration. The ATPM explicitly incorporates 1D heat conduction, shadowing, multiple scattering of sunlight, global self-heating, and rough surface thermal-infrared beaming in the model predictions. We find that ATPM can accurately reproduce the light-curve, thermal-infrared, and radar observations of Apollo, and simultaneously match the observed orbital drift and rotational acceleration using: a shape model with axis ratios of 1.94:1.65:1.00, an effective diameter of 1.55 +/- 0.07 km, a geometric albedo of 0.20 +/- 0.02, a thermal inertia of 140 +140/-100 J m-2 K-1 s-1/2, a highly rough surface, and a bulk density of 2850 +480/-680 kg m-3. Using these properties we predict that Apollo's obliquity is increasing towards the 180 degree YORP asymptotic state at a rate of 1.5 +0.3/-0.5 degrees per 10^5 yr. The derived thermal inertia suggests that Apollo has loose regolith material resting on its surface, which is consistent with Apollo undergoing a recent resurfacing event based on its observed Q-type spectrum. The inferred bulk density is consistent with those determined for other S-type asteroids, and suggests that Apollo has a fractured interior. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Mann,  Andrew W. Howard;"  Analyses of exoplanet statistics suggest a trend of giant planet occurrence with host star mass, a clue to how planets like Jupiter form. One missing piece of the puzzle is the occurrence around late K dwarf stars (masses of 0.5-0.75Msun and effective temperatures of 3900-4800K). We analyzed four years of Doppler radial velocities data of 110 late K dwarfs, one of which hosts two previously reported giant planets. We estimate that 4.0+/-2.3% of these stars have Saturn-mass or larger planets with orbital periods <245d, depending on the planet mass distribution and RV variability of stars without giant planets. We also estimate that 0.7+/-0.5% of similar stars observed by Kepler have giant planets. This Kepler rate is significantly (99% confidence) lower than that derived from our Doppler survey, but the difference vanishes if only the single Doppler system (HIP 57274) with completely resolved orbits is considered. The difference could also be explained by the exclusion of close binaries (without giant planets) from the Doppler but not Kepler surveys, the effect of long-period companions and stellar noise on the Doppler data, or an intrinsic difference between the two populations. Our estimates for late K dwarfs bridge those for solar-type stars and M dwarfs and support a positive trend with stellar mass. Small sample size precludes statements about finer structure, e.g. a ""shoulder"" in the distribution of giant planets with stellar mass. Future surveys such as the Next Generation Transit Survey and the Transiting Exoplanet Satellite Survey will ameliorate this deficiency. ";Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.3271;Optical Phase Curves of Kepler Exoplanets; Lisa J. Esteves,  Ernst J. W. De Mooij,  Ray Jayawardhana;  We have conducted a comprehensive search for optical phase variations of all planet candidates with tight orbits in fifteen quarters of data from the Kepler space telescope. After correcting for systematics, we found eight systems that appear to show secondary eclipses as well as phase variations. Of these, five (Kepler-5, Kepler-6, Kepler-8, KOI-64 and KOI-2133) are new and three (TrES-2, HAT-P-7 and KOI-13) have previously published phase curves, albeit with many fewer observations. We model the full phase curve of each planet candidate, including the primary and secondary transits, and derive their albedos, day- and night-side temperatures, ellipsoidal variations and Doppler beaming. We find that KOI-64 and KOI-2133 have night-side temperatures well above their equilibrium values (while KOI-2133 also has an albedo >1), so we conclude that they are likely to be self-luminous objects rather than planets. The characteristics of the six other candidates are consistent with their being planets with low geometric albedos (<0.3). For TrES-2 and KOI-13, the Kepler bandpass appears to probe atmospheric layers hotter than the planet's equilibrium temperature. For KOI-13, we detect a never-before-seen third cosine harmonic with an amplitude of 6.7+/-0.3 ppm and a phase shift of -1.1+/-0.1 radians in the phase curve residual, which could be due to its spin-orbit misalignment. We report derived planetary parameters for all six planets, including masses from ellipsoidal variations and Doppler beaming, and compare our results to published values when available. Our results nearly double the number of Kepler exoplanets with measured phase curve variations, thus providing valuable new constraints on the properties of close-in hot Jupiters. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Noyes,  Dimitar D. Sasselov;  We present HST STIS observations of two occultations of the transiting exoplanet HAT-P-1b. By measuring the planet to star flux ratio near opposition, we constrain the geometric albedo of the planet, which is strongly linked to its atmospheric temperature gradient. An advantage of HAT-P-1 as a target is its binary companion ADS 16402 A, which provides an excellent photometric reference, simplifying the usual steps in removing instrumental artifacts from HST time-series photometry. We find that without this reference star, we would need to detrend the lightcurve with the time of the exposures as well as the first three powers of HST orbital phase, and this would introduce a strong bias in the results for the albedo. However, with this reference star, we only need to detrend the data with the time of the exposures to achieve the same per-point scatter, therefore we can avoid most of the bias associated with detrending. Our final result is a 2 sigma upper limit of 0.64 for the geometric albedo of HAT-P-1b between 577 and 947 nm. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM)"

Bosumtwi crater is a well studied, 10.5 km in diameter, ca. 1.07 Ma old impact structure located in Ghana. The impactor was $\sim$ 1 km in diameter, an ordinary chondrite and struck the Earth with an angle between 30$^\circ$ and 45$^\circ$ from the horizontal. We have used a two phase backward integration to constrain the most probable parent region of the impactor. We find that the most likely source region is a high inclination object from the Middle Main Belt. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.3679;Kepler Observations of Very Low-Mass Stars; E. L. MartÃ­n,  J. Cabrera,  E. Martioli,  E. Solano,  R. Tata;  Observations of very low-mass stars with Kepler represent an excellent opportunity to search for planetary transits and to characterize optical photometric variability at the cool end of the stellar mass distribution. In this paper, we present low-resolution red optical spectra that allow us to identify 18 very low-mass stars that have Kepler light curves available in the public archive. Spectral types of these targets are found to lie in the range dM4.5--dM8.5, implying spectrophotometric distances from 17 pc to 80 pc. Limits to the presence of transiting planets are placed from modelling of the Kepler light curves. We find that the size of the planets detectable by Kepler around these small stars typically lie in the range 1 to 5 Earth radii within the habitable regions (P$\le$10 days). We identify one candidate transit with a period of 1.26 days that resembles the signal produced by a planet slightly smaller than the Moon. However, our pixel by pixel analysis of the Kepler data shows that the signal most likely arises from a background contaminating eclipsing binary. For 11 of these objects reliable photometric periods shorter than 7 days are derived, and are interpreted as rotational modulation of magnetic cool spots. For 3 objects we find possible photometric periods longer than 50 days that require confirmation. H$_\alpha$ emission measurements and flare rates are used as a proxies for chromospheric activity and transversal velocities are used as an indicator of dynamical ages. These data allow us to discuss the relationship between magnetic activity and detectability of planetary transits around very low-mass stars. We show that Super-Earth planets with sizes around 2 Earth radii are detectable with Kepler around about two thirds of the stars in our sample, independently from their level of chromospheric activity. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Watson (QUB);  We obtained high-resolution, high-contrast optical imaging in the SDSS $i'$ band with the LuckyCam camera mounted on the 2.56m Nordic Optical Telescope, to search for faint stellar companions to 16 stars harbouring transiting exoplanets. The Lucky Imaging technique uses very short exposures to obtain near diffraction-limited images yielding sub-arcsecond sensitivity, allowing us to search for faint stellar companions within the seeing disc of the primary planet host. Here we report the detection of two candidate stellar companions to the planet host TrES-1 at separations $<6.5\arcsec$ and we confirm stellar companions to CoRoT-2, CoRoT-3, TrES-2, TrES-4, and HAT-P-7 already known in the literature. We do not confirm the candidate companions to HAT-P-8 found via Lucky Imaging by \citet{Bergfors2013}, however, most probably because HAT-P-8 was observed in poor seeing conditions. Our detection sensitivity limits allow us to place constraints on the spectral types and masses of the putative bound companions to the planet host stars in our sample. If bound, the stellar companions identified in this work would provide stringent observational constraints to models of planet formation and evolution. In addition these companions could affect the derived physical properties of the exoplanets in these systems. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)"

Raymond,  M. Delbo;"  Short period (<50 days) low-mass (<10Mearth) exoplanets are abundant and the few of them whose radius and mass have been measured already reveal a diversity in composition. Some of these exoplanets are found on eccentric orbits and are subjected to strong tides affecting their rotation and resulting in significant tidal heating. Within this population, some planets are likely to be depleted in volatiles and have no atmosphere. We model the thermal emission of these ""Super Mercuries"" to study the signatures of rotation and tidal dissipation on their infrared light curve. We compute the time-dependent temperature map at the surface and in the subsurface of the planet and the resulting disk-integrated emission spectrum received by a distant observer for any observation geometry. We calculate the illumination of the planetary surface for any Keplerian orbit and rotation. We include the internal tidal heat flow, vertical heat diffusion in the subsurface and generate synthetic light curves. We show that the different rotation periods predicted by tidal models (spin-orbit resonances, pseudo-synchronization) produce different photometric signatures, which are observable provided that the thermal inertia of the surface is high, like that of solid or melted rocks (but not regolith). Tidal dissipation can also directly affect the light curves and make the inference of the rotation more difficult or easier depending on the existence of hot spots on the surface. Infrared light curve measurement with the James Webb Space Telescope and EChO can be used to infer exoplanets' rotation periods and dissipation rates and thus to test tidal models. This data will also constrain the nature of the (sub)surface by constraining the thermal inertia. ";Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Asher;  Many previous works have shown the relevance and dynamics of Jovian mean motion resonances (MMR) in various meteoroid streams. These resonant swarms are known to have produced spectacular meteor displays in the past. In this work we investigate whether any MMR due to Saturn are feasible, and subsequently check whether such effects are strong enough to trap meteoroids so as to cause enhanced meteor phenomena on Earth. Extensive numerical simulations are done on two major meteoroid streams, which are known to exhibit exterior Jovian resonances. The roles of the 1:6 and 5:14 Jovian MMR have already been studied in the Orionids and Leonids respectively. Now we find strong evidence of 1:3 and 8:9 Saturnian MMR in Orionids and Leonids respectively. The presence of compact dust trails in real space due to these two Saturnian resonances is confirmed from our calculations. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Jessen-Hansen,  A. Ofir,  J. Telting;  We report the discovery of Kepler-77b (alias KOI-127.01), a Saturn-mass transiting planet in a 3.6-day orbit around a metal-rich solar-like star. We combined the publicly available Kepler photometry (quarters 1-13) with high-resolution spectroscopy from the Sandiford@McDonald and FIES@NOT spectrographs. We derived the system parameters via a simultaneous joint fit to the photometric and radial velocity measurements. Our analysis is based on the Bayesian approach and is carried out by sampling the parameter posterior distributions using a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. Kepler-77b is a moderately inflated planet with a mass of Mp=0.430+/-0.032 Mjup, a radius of Rp=0.960+/-0.016 Rjup, and a bulk density of 0.603+/-0.055 g/cm^3. It orbits a slowly rotating (P=36+/-6 days) G5V star with M*=0.95+/-0.04 Msun, R*=0.99+/-0.02 Rsun, Teff=5520+/-60 K, [M/H]=0.20+/-0.05, that has an age of 7.5+/-2.0 Gyr. The lack of detectable planetary occultation with a depth higher than about 10 ppm implies a planet geometric and Bond albedo of Ag<0.087+/-0.008 and Ab<0.058+/-0.006, respectively, placing Kepler-77b among the gas-giant planets with the lowest albedo known so far. We found neither additional planetary transit signals nor transit-timing variations at a level of about 0.5 minutes, in accordance with the trend that close-in gas giant planets seem to belong to single-planet systems. The 106 transits observed in short-cadence mode by Kepler for nearly 1.2 years show no detectable signatures of the planet's passage in front of starspots. We explored the implications of the absence of detectable spot-crossing events for the inclination of the stellar spin-axis, the sky-projected spin-orbit obliquity, and the latitude of magnetically active regions. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.4070;Super Earths and Dynamical Stability of Planetary Systems: First  Parallel GPU Simulations Using GENGA; S.Elser,  S.L.Grimm,  J.G.Stadel;  We report on the stability of hypothetical Super-Earths in the habitable zone of known multi-planetary systems. Most of them have not yet been studied in detail concerning the existence of additional low-mass planets. The new N-body code GENGA developed at the UZH allows us to perform numerous N-body simulations in parallel on GPUs. With this numerical tool, we can study the stability of orbits of hypothetical planets in the semi-major axis and eccentricity parameter space in high resolution. Massless test particle simulations give good predictions on the extension of the stable region and show that HIP 14180 and HD 37124 do not provide stable orbits in the habitable zone. Based on these simulations, we carry out simulations of 10 Earth mass planets in several systems (HD 11964, HD 47186, HD 147018, HD 163607, HD 168443, HD 187123, HD 190360, HD 217107 and HIP 57274). They provide more exact information about orbits at the location of mean motion resonances and at the edges of the stability zones. Beside the stability of orbits, we study the secular evolution of the planets to constrain probable locations of hypothetical planets. Assuming that planetary systems are in general closely packed, we find that apart from HD 168443, all of the systems can harbor 10 Earth mass planets in the habitable zone. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Marley,  Channon Visscher,  Kevin Zahnle;  Recent observations of the super-Earth GJ 1214b show that it has a relatively featureless transmission spectrum. One suggestion is that these observations indicate that the planet's atmosphere is vertically compact, perhaps due to a water-rich composition that yields a large mean molecular weight. Another suggestion is that the atmosphere is hydrogen/helium-rich with clouds that obscure predicted absorption features. Previous models that incorporate clouds have included their effect without a strong physical motivation for their existence. Here, we present model atmospheres of GJ 1214b that include physically-motivated clouds of two types. We model the clouds that form as a result of condensation in chemical equilibrium, as they likely do on brown dwarfs, which include KCl and ZnS for this planet. We also include clouds that form as a result of photochemistry, forming a hydrocarbon haze layer. We use a photochemical kinetics model to understand the vertical distribution and available mass of haze-forming molecules. We model both solar and enhanced-metallicity cloudy models and determine the cloud properties necessary to match observations. In enhanced-metallicity atmospheres, we find that the equilibrium clouds can match the observations of GJ 1214b if they are lofted high into the atmosphere and have a low sedimentation efficiency (fsed=0.1). We find that models with a variety of hydrocarbon haze properties can match the observations. Particle sizes from 0.01 to 0.25 micron can match the transmission spectrum with haze-forming efficiencies as low as 1-5%. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Bento,  T.R. Marsh,  V.S. Dhillon,  J.J. Fortney,  S.P. Littlefair,  R. Hickman;  Transmission spectroscopy has been successfully used from both the ground and in space to characterise the atmospheres of transiting exoplanets. This technique is challenging from the ground because ground-based spectrographs tend not to be designed to be photometrically stable, and effects such as variable slit losses cause significant systematic uncertainties. An alternative approach is to use simultaneous photometric observations in multiple wavebands to determine wavelength dependent transit depth differences. We report an application of this technique to one of the hottest known exoplanets, WASP-12b, using the triple-beam camera ULTRACAM. We obtained simultaneous light curves in Sloan u', and two narrow band filters centered on 4169 and 6010 angstroms, with FWHMs 52 and 118 angstroms respectively. We fit these light curves with a photometric model and determine the planetary radius in the three different bands. Our data show no evidence for a difference in planetary radius over the wavelength range we study, and are consistent with an atmosphere that is dominated by Rayleigh scattering from a high altitude haze, as well as more complicated atmosphere models which include the effects of molecules such as TiO. Our planetary radius measurements have an average precision of 2.6 per cent, compared to the ~1.4 - 2.4 per cent radius differences predicted by the models over this wavelength range. We also find a consistent time of ingress and egress across our three wavebands, in contrast to the early ingress which has been reported for this system at shorter wavelengths. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Kotson,  David W. Latham,  Lars A. Buchhave;  We report the discovery of an Earth-sized planet ($1.16\pm 0.19 R_\oplus$) in an 8.5-hour orbit around a late G-type star (KIC 8435766, Kepler-78). The object was identified in a search for short-period planets in the {\it Kepler} database and confirmed to be a transiting planet (as opposed to an eclipsing stellar system) through the absence of ellipsoidal light variations or substantial radial-velocity variations. The unusually short orbital period and the relative brightness of the host star ($m_{\rm Kep}$ = 11.5) enable robust detections of the changing illumination of the visible hemisphere of the planet, as well as the occultations of the planet by the star. We interpret these signals as representing a combination of reflected and reprocessed light, with the highest planet dayside temperature in the range of 2300 K to 3100 K. Follow-up spectroscopy combined with finer sampling photometric observations will further pin down the system parameters and may even yield the mass of the planet. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

The dust tails brightness and morphology are best interpreted in terms of a model of sustained dust emission spanning 4 to 6 months. The total dust mass ejected is estimated at $\sim$6--25$\times10^6$ kg. We assume a time-independent power-law size distribution function, with particles in the micrometer to centimeter size range. Based on the quality of the fits to the isophote fields, an anisotropic emission pattern is favored against an isotropic one, in which the particle ejection is concentrated toward high latitudes ($\pm45^\circ$ to $\pm90^\circ$) in a high obliquity object ($I$=80$^\circ$). This seasonally-driven ejection behavior, along with the modeled particle ejection velocities, are in remarkable agreement to those we found for P/2010 R2 (La Sagra) \citep{Moreno11a}. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.4764;Influence of an inner core on the long-period forced librations of  Mercury; Marie Yseboodt,  Attilio Rivoldini,  Tim Van Hoolst,  Mathieu Dumberry;  The planetary perturbations on Mercury's orbit lead to long-period forced librations of Mercury's mantle. These librations have previously been studied for a planet with two layers: a mantle and a liquid core. Here, we calculate how the presence of a solid inner core in the liquid outer core influences the long-period forced librations. Mantle-inner core coupling affects the long-period libration dynamics mainly by changing the free libration: first, it lengthens the period of the free libration of the mantle, and second, it adds a second free libration, closely related to the free gravitational oscillation between the mantle and inner core. The two free librations have periods between 2.5 and 18 y depending on the internal structure. We show that large amplitude long-period librations of 10's of arcsec are generated when the period of a planetary forcing approaches one of the two free libration periods. These amplitudes are sufficiently large to be detectable by spacecraft measurements of the libration of Mercury. The amplitudes of the angular velocity of Mercury's mantle at planetary forcing periods are also amplified by the resonances, but remain much smaller than the current precision of Earth-based radar observations unless the period is very close to a free libration period. The inclusion of mantle-inner core coupling in the rotation model does not significantly improve the fit to the radar observations. This implies that it is not yet possible to determine the size of the inner core of Mercury on the basis of available observations of Mercury's rotation rate. Future observations of the long-period librations may be used to constrain the interior structure of Mercury, including the size of its inner core. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Souami;  Previous works have identified families halos by an analysis in proper elements domains, or by using Sloan Digital Sky Survey-Moving Object Catalog data, fourth release (SDSS-MOC4) multi-band photometry to infer the asteroid taxonomy, or by a combination of the two methods. The limited number of asteroids for which geometric albedo was known until recently discouraged in the past the extensive use of this additional parameter, which is however of great importance in identifying an asteroid taxonomy. The new availability of geometric albedo data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) mission for about 100,000 asteroids significantly increased the sample of objects for which such information, with some errors, is now known. In this work we proposed a new method to identify families halos in a multi-domain space composed by proper elements, SDSS-MOC4 (a*,i-z) colors, and WISE geometric albedo for the whole main belt (and the Hungaria and Cybele orbital regions). Assuming that most families were created by the breakup of an undifferentiated parent body, they are expected to be homogeneous in colors and albedo. The new method is quite effective in determining objects belonging to a family halo, with low percentages of likely interlopers, and results that are quite consistent in term of taxonomy and geometric albedo of the halo members. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Additional observations were made with EFOSC2 on the 3.5-m NTT telescope of the European Southern Observatory at La Silla, Chile in Feb 2011. The observations reveal a sinusoidal light curve with amplitude 0.14 mag and period 5.4955 +/- 0.0025d, which is likely half the true rotation period.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.5197;Iron abundance correlations and an occurrence distribution discrepancy  from ongoing planet migration; Stuart F. Taylor;"  Whether the higher occurrence of giant planets being hosted by metal-rich versus metal-poor stars results from formation or from ""pollution"" has been a question of intense debate. We present new patterns that emerge when planet/star systems are separated by stellar [Fe/H], and when systems with stellar companions are separated out. These differences can best be explained if the onset of high eccentricity planet migration is also a time when planet are sent into merge with the star. Planet migration into the star is likely a complementary explanation to the view that systems with higher initial iron abundance form more planets, and that more crowded planets are more likely to scatter into eccentric orbits. Planets of iron-rich single stars have eccentricity distributions that are higher than planets of iron-poor single stars (where ""rich"" and ""poor"" are stars whose [Fe/H] is above and below solar, respectively). Stars with planets that have a stellar companion comprise a third population of systems in which the stars are preferentially iron-rich. We describe new patterns that are best explained by eccentric planet migration being associated with other planets migrating into the star. Though medium planets are more numerous than giant planets at periods greater than three days, giant planets are more numerous than medium planets at the shortest periods. Since giant planets migrate into the star faster, we show this as evidence of giant planet migration. Planet migration into the star is certain to be an important part of planetary system evolution.

Kaib;"  We study the influence of outer Solar System architecture on the structural evolution of the Oort Cloud (OC) and the flux of Earth-crossing comets. In particular, we seek to quantify the role of the giant planets as ""planetary protectors"". To do so, we have run simulations in each of four different planetary mass configurations to understand the significance of each of the giant planets. Because the outer planets modify the structure of the OC throughout its formation, we integrate each simulation over the full age of the Solar System. Over this time, we follow the evolution of cometary orbits from their starting point in the protoplanetary disk to their injection into the OC to their possible re-entry into the inner planetary region. We find that the overall structure of the OC, including the location of boundaries and the relative number of comets in the inner and outer parts, does not change significantly between configurations; however, as planetary mass decreases, the trapping efficiency (TE) of comets into the OC and the flux of comets into the observable region increases. We determine that those comets that evolve onto Earth-crossing orbits come primarily from the inner OC but show no preference for initial protoplanetary disk location. We also find that systems that have at least a Saturn-mass object are effective at deflecting possible Earth-crossing comets but the difference in flux between systems with and without such a planet is less than an order of magnitude. We conclude by discussing the individual roles of the planets and the implications of incorporating more realistic planetary accretion and migration scenarios into simulations, particularly on existing discrepancies between low TE and the mass of the protoplanetary disk and on determining the structural boundaries of the OC.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.5398;Growth of a Protostar and a Young Circumstellar Disk with High Mass  Accretion Rate onto the Disk; Takuya Ohtani,  Toru Tsuribe;  The growing process of both a young protostar and a circumstellar disk is investigated. Viscous evolution of a disk around a single star is considered with a model where a disk increases its mass by dynamically accreting envelope and simultaneously loses its mass via viscous accretion onto the central star. We focus on the circumstellar disk with high mass accretion rate onto the disk $\dot{M}=8.512c_{\rm s}^3/G$ as a result of dynamical collapse of rotating molecular cloud core. We study the origin of the surface density distribution and the origin of the disk-to-star mass ratio by means of numerical calculations of unsteady viscous accretion disk in one-dimensional axisymmetric model. It is shown that the radial profiles of the surface density $\Sigma$, azimuthal velocity $v_{\phi}$, and mass accretion rate $\dot{M}$ in the inner region approach to the quasi-steady state. Profile of the surface density distribution in the quasi-steady state is determined as a result of angular momentum transport rather than its original distribution of angular momentum in the cloud core. It is also shown that the disk mass becomes larger than the central star in the long time limit as long as temporary constant mass flux onto the disk is assumed. After the mass infall rate onto the disk declines owing to the depletion of the parent cloud core, the disk-to-star mass ratio $M_{\rm disk}/M_*$ decreases. The disk-to-star mass ratio becomes smaller than unity after $t> 10^5 \rm yr$ and $t>10^6 \rm yr$ from the beginning of the accretion phase in the case with $\alpha_0 =1 {\rm and} 0.1$, respectively, where $\alpha_0 $ is the constant part of viscous parameter. In the case with $\alpha_0 \leq 10^{-2}$, $M_{\rm disk}/M_*$ is still larger than unity at $2 \rm Myr$ from the beginning of the accretion phase. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

At the current value of orbital eccentricity, the probability of capture into the 3:2 resonance is as high as 0.6, but it strongly depends on the temperature and average viscosity of the Moon's interior. A warmer, less viscous Moon on a higher-eccentricity orbit is even more easily captured into supersynchronous resonances.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.5540;A simple scaling for the minimum instability time-scale of two widely  spaced planets; Dimitri Veras,  Alexander J. Mustill;"  Long-term instability in multi-planet exosystems is a crucial consideration when confirming putative candidates, analyzing exoplanet populations, constraining the age of exosystems, and identifying the sources of white dwarf pollution. Two planets which are Hill stable are separated by a wide-enough distance to ensure that they will never collide. However, Hill stable planetary systems may eventually manifest Lagrange instability when the outer planet escapes or the inner planet collides with the star. We show empirically that for two nearly coplanar Hill stable planets with eccentricities less than about 0.3, instability can manifest itself only after a time corresponding to X initial orbits of the inner planet, where log_{10}(X) is of the order of 5.2 mu^{-0.18} and mu is the planet-star mass ratio measured in (Jupiter mass/Solar mass). This relation applies to any type of equal-mass secondaries, and suggests that two low-eccentricity Hill stable terrestrial-mass or smaller-mass planets should be Lagrange stable throughout the main sequence lifetime of any white dwarf progenitor. However, Hill stable giant planets are not guaranteed to be Lagrange stable, particularly within a few tens of percent beyond the critical Hill separation. Our scaling represents a useful ""rule of thumb"" for planetary population syntheses or individual systems for which performing detailed long-term integrations is unfeasible.

Otten,  David H. Bekkers,  Sebastiaan Y. Haffert,  Josha. J. van Houdt;  We investigate the atmosphere of GJ1214b, a transiting super-Earth planet with a low mean density, by measuring its transit depth as a function of wavelength in the blue optical portion of the spectrum. It is thought that this planet is either a mini-Neptune, consisting of a rocky core with a thick, hydrogen-rich atmosphere, or a planet with a composition dominated by water. Most observations favor a water-dominated atmosphere with a small scale-height, however, some observations indicate that GJ1214b could have an extended atmosphere with a cloud layer muting the molecular features. In an atmosphere with a large scale-height, Rayleigh scattering at blue wavelengths is likely to cause a measurable increase in the apparent size of the planet towards the blue. We observed the transit of GJ1214b in the B-band with the FOcal Reducing Spectrograph (FORS) at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) and in the g-band with both ACAM on the William Hershel Telescope (WHT) and the Wide Field Camera (WFC) at the Isaac Newton Telescope (INT). We find a planet-to-star radius ratio in the B-band of 0.1162+/-0.0017, and in the g-band 0.1180+/-0.0009 and 0.1174+/-0.0017 for the WHT & INT observations respectively. These optical data do not show significant deviations from previous measurements at longer wavelengths. In fact, a flat transmission spectrum across all wavelengths best describes the combined observations. When atmospheric models are considered a small scale-height water-dominated model fits the data best. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Price;  We present initial results from observations and numerical analyses aimed at characterizing main-belt comet P/2012 T1 (PANSTARRS). Optical monitoring observations were made between October 2012 and February 2013 using the University of Hawaii 2.2 m telescope, the Keck I telescope, the Baade and Clay Magellan telescopes, Faulkes Telescope South, the Perkins Telescope at Lowell Observatory, and the Southern Astrophysical Research (SOAR) telescope. The object's intrinsic brightness approximately doubles from the time of its discovery in early October until mid-November and then decreases by ~60% between late December and early February, similar to photometric behavior exhibited by several other main-belt comets and unlike that exhibited by disrupted asteroid (596) Scheila. We also used Keck to conduct spectroscopic searches for CN emission as well as absorption at 0.7 microns that could indicate the presence of hydrated minerals, finding an upper limit CN production rate of QCN<1.5x10^23 mol/s, from which we infer a water production rate of QH2O<5x10^25 mol/s, and no evidence of the presence of hydrated minerals. Numerical simulations indicate that P/2012 T1 is largely dynamically stable for >100 Myr and is unlikely to be a recently implanted interloper from the outer solar system, while a search for potential asteroid family associations reveal that it is dynamically linked to the ~155 Myr-old Lixiaohua asteroid family. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

";  Since the discovery of the first exoplanet we have known that other planetary systems can look quite unlike our own. However, until recently we have only been able to probe the upper range of the planet size distribution. The high precision of the Kepler space telescope has allowed us to detect planets that are the size of Earth and somewhat smaller, but no previous planets have been found that are smaller than those we see in our own Solar System. Here we report the discovery of a planet significantly smaller than Mercury. This tiny planet is the innermost of three planets that orbit the Sun-like host star, which we have designated Kepler-37. Owing to its extremely small size, similar to that of Earth's Moon, and highly irradiated surface, Kepler-37b is probably a rocky planet with no atmosphere or water, similar to Mercury. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.6139;CO Cameron band and CO2+ UV doublet emissions in the dayglow of Venus:  Role of CO in the Cameron band production; Anil Bhardwaj,  Sonal Kumar Jain;  Present study deals with the model calculations of CO Cameron band and CO2+ ultraviolet doublet emissions in the dayglow of Venus. The overhead and limb intensities of CO Cameron band and CO2+ UV doublet emissions are calculated for low, moderate, and high solar activity conditions. Using updated cross sections, the impact of dierent e-CO cross section for Cameron band production is estimated. The electron impact on CO is the major source mechanism of Cameron band, followed by electron and photon impact dissociation of CO2. The overhead intensities of CO Cameron band and CO2+ UV doublet emissions are about a factor of 2 higher in solar maximum than those in solar minimum condition. The effect of solar EUV flux models on the emission intensity is ~30-40% in solar minimum condition and ~2-10% in solar maximum condition. At the altitude of emission peak (135 km), the model predicted limb intensity of CO Cameron band and CO2+ UV doublet emissions in moderate (F10.7 = 130) solar activity condition is about 2400 and 300 kR, respectively, which is in agreement with the very recently published SPICAV/Venus Express observation. The model limb intensity profiles of CO Cameron band and CO2+ UV doublet are compared with SPICAV observation. We also calculated intensities of N2 Vegard-Kaplan UV bands and OI 2972 {\AA} emissions during moderate and high solar activity conditions. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.6313;Gaps in Protoplanetary Disks as Signatures of Planets: II. Inclined  Disks; Hannah Jang-Condell,  Neal J. Turner;  We examine the observational appearance of partial gaps being opened by planets in protoplanetary disks, considering the effects of the inclination relative to the line of sight. The gap's trough is darkened by both shadowing and cooling, relative to the uninterrupted disk. The gap's outer wall is brightened by direct illumination and also by heating, which puffs it up so that it intercepts more starlight. In this paper, we examine the effects of inclination on resolved images of disks with and without gaps at a wide range of wavelengths. The scattering surface's offset from the disk midplane creates a brightness asymmetry along the axis of inclination, making the disk's near side appear brighter than the far side in scattered light. Finite disk thickness also causes the projected distances of equidistant points on the disk surface to be smaller on the near side of the disk as compared to the far side. Consequently, the gap shoulder on the near side of the disk should appear brighter and closer to the star than on the far side. However, if the angular resolution of the observation is coarser than the width of the brightened gap shoulder, then the gap shoulder on the far side may appear brighter because of its larger apparent size. We present a formula to recover the scale height and inclination angle of an imaged disk using simple geometric arguments and measuring disk asymmetries. Resolved images of circumstellar disks have revealed clearings and gaps, such as the transitional disk in LkCa 15. Models created using our synthetic imaging attempting to match the morphology of observed scattered light images of LkCa 15 indicate that the H-band flux deficit in the inner $\sim0.5\arcsec$ of the disk can be explained with a planet of mass greater than 0.5 Jupiter mass. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.6513;Analytical Treatment of Planetary Resonances; Konstantin Batygin,  Alessandro Morbidelli;  An ever-growing observational aggregate of extrasolar planets has revealed that systems of planets that reside in or near mean-motion resonances are relatively common. While the origin of such systems is attributed to protoplanetary disk-driven migration, a qualitative description of the dynamical evolution of resonant planets remains largely elusive. Aided by the pioneering works of the last century, we formulate an approximate, integrable theory for first-order resonant motion. We utilize the developed theory to construct an intuitive, geometrical representation of resonances within the context of the unrestricted three-body problem. Moreover, we derive a simple analytical criterion for the appearance of secondary resonances between resonant and secular motion. Subsequently, we demonstrate the onset of rapid chaotic motion as a result of overlap among neighboring first-order mean-motion resonances, as well as the appearance of slow chaos as a result of secular modulation of the planetary orbits. Finally, we take advantage of the integrable theory to analytically show that, in the adiabatic regime, divergent encounters with first-order mean-motion resonances always lead to persistent apsidal anti-alignment. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.6548;Adaptive Optics Images II: 12 Kepler Objects of Interest and 15  Confirmed Transiting Planets; Elisabeth R. Adams,  Andrea K. Dupree,  Craig Kulesa,  Don McCarthy;  All transiting planet observations are at risk of contamination from nearby, unresolved stars. Blends dilute the transit signal, causing the planet to appear smaller than it really is, or produce a false positive detection when the target star is blended with an eclipsing binary. High spatial resolution adaptive optics images are the best way of resolving undetected contaminants. Here we present companions and detection limits for 12 Kepler candidates, of which 4 have companions within 4 arcsec. One system (KOI 1537) consists of two similar-magnitude stars separated by 0.1 arcsec, while KOI 174 has a companion at 0.5 arcsec. In addition, observations were made of 15 transiting planets that were previously discovered by other surveys. The only companion found within 1 arcsec of a known planet is the previously identified companion to WASP-2b. An additional four systems have companions between 1-4 arcsec: HAT-P-30b (3.7 arcsec, Delta Ks = 2.9), HAT-P-32b (2.9 arcsec, Delta Ks = 3.4), TrES-1b (2.3 arcsec, Delta Ks = 7.7), and WASP-P-33b (1.9 arcsec, Delta Ks = 5.5), some of which have not been reported previously. Depending on the spatial resolution of the transit photometry for these systems, these companion stars may require a reassessment of the planetary parameters derived from transit light curves. For all systems observed, we report the limiting magnitudes of additional objects located 0.1-4 arcsec from the target. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.6607;The bright end of the exo-Zodi luminosity function: Disk evolution and  implications for exo-Earth detectability; Grant M. Kennedy,  Mark C. Wyatt;"  We present the first characterisation of the 12um warm dust (""exo-Zodi"") luminosity function around Sun-like stars, focussing on the dustiest systems that can be identified by WISE. We detect six new warm dust candidates, five of which have unknown ages. We show that the dustiest old (>Gyr) systems like BD+20 307 are 1 in 10,000 occurrences. Bright warm dust is more common around young (<120Myr) systems, with a ~1% occurrence rate. We show that a two component in situ model where all stars have initially massive warm disks and in which warm debris is also generated at some random time along the stars' main-sequence lifetime, perhaps due to a collision, can explain the observations. However, if all stars only have initially massive warm disks these would not be visible at Gyr ages, and random collisions on the main-sequence are too infrequent to explain the high disk occurrence rate for young stars. That is, neither component can explain the observations on their own. Despite these conclusions, we cannot rule out an alternative model in which comets are scattered from outer regions because the distribution of systems with the appropriate dynamics is unknown. Our in situ model predicts the fraction of stars with exo-Zodi bright enough to cause problems for future exo-Earth imaging attempts is at least ~10%, and is higher for populations of stars younger than a few Gyr. This prediction of ~10% applies to old stars because bright systems like BD+20 307 imply a population of fainter systems that were once bright but are now decaying through fainter levels. Our prediction should be strongly tested by the Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer, providing valuable input for more detailed evolution models. A detection fraction lower than our prediction could indicate that the hot dust in systems like BD+20 307 has a cometary origin due to the quirks of the planetary dynamics.

The high quality of the gathered data provides us with an unique opportunity to determine the surface and internal properties of one of the most important and intriguing main belt asteroids (MBAs). In this paper, we focus on the size frequency distributions (SFDs) of sub-kilometer impact craters observed at high spatial resolution on several selected young terrains on Vesta. These small crater populations offer an excellent opportunity to determine the nature of their asteroidal precursors (namely MBAs) at sizes that are not directly observable from ground-based telescopes (i.e., below ~100 m diameter). Moreover, unlike many other MBA surfaces observed by spacecraft thus far, the young terrains examined had crater spatial densities that were far from empirical saturation. Overall, we find that the cumulative power-law index (slope) of small crater SFDs on Vesta is fairly consistent with predictions derived from current collisional and dynamical models down to a projectile size of ~10 m diameter (Bottke et al., 2005a,b). The shape of the impactor SFD for small projectile sizes does not appear to have changed over the last several billions of years, and an argument can be made that the absolute number of small MBAs has remained roughly constant (within a factor of 2) over the same time period. The apparent steady state nature of the main belt population potentially provides us with a set of intriguing constraints that can be used to glean insights into the physical evolution of individual MBAs as well as the main belt as an ensemble. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

We find that the initial Harris current sheet develops in three ways, depending on the strength of turbulence: laminar reconnection, turbulent reconnection, and turbulent diffusion. The turbulent reconnection explosively converts the magnetic field energy into both kinetic and thermal energy of plasmas, and generates open fast reconnection jets. This fast turbulent reconnection is achieved by the localization of turbulent diffusion. Additionally, localized structure forms through the interaction of the mean field and turbulence. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.6768;Dynamical analysis of the Gliese-876 Laplace resonance; J. G. Marti,  C. A. Giuppone,  C. Beauge;  The existence of multiple planetary systems involved in mean motion conmensurabilities has increased significantly since the Kepler mission. Although most correspond to 2-planet resonances, multiple resonances have also been found. The Laplace resonance is a particular case of a three-body resonance where the period ratio between consecutive pairs is n_1/n_2 near to n_2/n_3 near to 2/1. It is not clear how this triple resonance can act in order to stabilize (or not) the systems. The most reliable extrasolar system located in a Laplace resonance is GJ876 because it has two independent confirmations. However best-fit parameters were obtained without previous knowledge of resonance structure and no exploration of all the possible stable solutions for the system where done. In the present work we explored the different configurations allowed by the Laplace resonance in the GJ876 system by varying the planetary parameters of the third outer planet. We find that in this case the Laplace resonance is a stabilization mechanism in itself, defined by a tiny island of regular motion surrounded by (unstable) highly chaotic orbits. Low eccentric orbits and mutual inclinations from -20 to 20 degrees are compatible with the observations. A definite range of mass ratio must be assumed to maintain orbital stability. Finally we give constrains for argument of pericenters and mean anomalies in order to assure stability for this kind of systems. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.6926;The Effect of Host Star Spectral Energy Distribution and Ice-Albedo  Feedback on the Climate of Extrasolar Planets; Aomawa L. Shields,  Victoria S. Meadows,  Cecilia M. Bitz,  Raymond T. Pierrehumbert,  Manoj M. Joshi,  Tyler D. Robinson;  Planetary climate can be affected by the interaction of the host star spectral energy distribution with the wavelength-dependent reflectivity of ice and snow. Here we explore this effect using a one dimensional (1-D), line-by-line, radiative-transfer model to calculate broadband planetary albedos as input to a seasonally varying, 1-D energy-balance climate model. A three-dimensional general circulation model is also used to explore the atmosphere's response to changes in incoming stellar radiation, or instellation, and surface albedo. Using this hierarchy of models we simulate planets covered by ocean, land, and water ice of varying grain size, with incident radiation from stars of different spectral types. Terrestrial planets orbiting stars with higher near-UV radiation exhibit a stronger ice-albedo feedback. We find that ice-covered conditions occur on an F-dwarf planet with only a 2% reduction in instellation relative to the present instellation on Earth, assuming fixed CO2 (present atmospheric level on Earth). A similar planet orbiting the Sun at an equivalent flux distance requires an 8% reduction in instellation, while a planet orbiting an M-dwarf star requires an additional 19% reduction in instellation to become ice-covered, equivalent to 73% of the modern solar constant. The surface ice-albedo feedback effect becomes less important at the outer edge of the habitable zone, where atmospheric CO2 can be expected to be high in order to maintain clement conditions for surface liquid water. We show that 3-10 bars of CO2 will entirely mask the climatic effect of ice and snow, leaving the outer limits of the habitable zone unaffected by the spectral dependence of water ice and snow albedo. However, less CO2 is needed to maintain open water for a planet orbiting an M-dwarf star, than would be the case for hotter main-sequence stars. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Two transits were observed in B-band using the Suprime-Cam and the FOCAS instruments onboard the Subaru 8.2m telescope, and one transit was done in JHKs-bands simultaneously with the SIRIUS camera on the IRSF 1.4m telescope. MCMC analyses show that the planet-to-star radius ratios are, Rp/Rs = 0.11651 \pm 0.00065 (B-band, Subaru/Suprime-Cam), Rp/Rs = 0.11601 \pm 0.00117 (B-band, Subaru/FOCAS), Rp/Rs = 0.11654 \pm 0.00080 (J-band, IRSF/SIRIUS), Rp/Rs = 0.11550 ^{+0.00142}_{-0.00153} (H-band, IRSF/SIRIUS), and Rp/Rs = 0.11547 \pm 0.00127 (Ks-band, IRSF/SIRIUS). The Subaru Suprime-Cam transit photometry shows a possible spot-crossing feature. Comparisons of the new transit depths and those from previous studies with the theoretical models by Howe & Burrows (2012) suggest that the high molecular weight atmosphere (e.g., 1% H$_2$O + 99% N$_2$) models are most likely, however, the low molecular weight (hydrogen dominated) atmospheres with extensive clouds are still not excluded.

Compared to a more quiescent state before it fragments, the radial velocity of the gas increases by up to a factor of ~2-3 after fragmentation. While the mass movement occurs both inwards and outwards, the inwards motion can cause the inner spirals to be sufficiently dense that they may become unstable and potentially fragment. Consequently, the dynamical behaviour of fragmented discs may cause subsequent fragmentation at smaller radii after an initial fragment has formed in the outer disc. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)"

Bauer,  David Levitan,  Branimir Sesar,  Russ Laher,  Jason Surace;  Cometary activity in main-belt asteroids probes the ice content of these objects and provides clues to the history of volatiles in the inner solar system. We search the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) survey to derive upper limits on the population size of active main-belt comets (MBCs). From data collected March 2009 through July 2012, we extracted 2 million observations of 220 thousand known main-belt objects (40% of the known population, down to 1-km diameter) and discovered 626 new objects in multi-night linked detections. We formally quantify the extendedness of a small-body observation, account for systematic variation in this metric (e.g., due to on-sky motion) and evaluate this method's robustness in identifying cometary activity using observations of 115 comets, including two known candidate MBCs and six newly-discovered non-main-belt comets (two of which were originally designated as asteroids by other surveys). We demonstrate a 66% detection efficiency with respect to the extendedness distribution of the 115 sampled comets, and a 100% detection efficiency with respect to extendedness levels greater than or equal to those we observed in the known candidate MBCs P/2010 R2 (La Sagra) and P/2006 VW139. Using a log-constant prior, we infer 95% confidence upper limits of 33 and 22 active MBCs (per million main-belt asteroids down to 1-km diameter), for detection efficiencies of 66% and 100%, respectively. In a follow-up to this morphological search, we will perform a photometric (disk-integrated brightening) search for MBCs. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.7232;Wind-driven Accretion in Protoplanetary Disks --- II: Radial Dependence  and Global Picture; Xue-Ning Bai (CfA);"  Non-ideal magnetohydrodynamical effects play a crucial role in determining the mechanism and efficiency of angular momentum transport as well as the level of turbulence in protoplanetary disks (PPDs), which are key to understanding PPD evolution and planet formation. It was shown in our previous work that at 1 AU, the magnetorotational instability (MRI) is completely suppressed when both Ohmic resistivity and ambipolar diffusion (AD) are taken into account, resulting in a laminar flow with accretion driven by magnetocentrifugal wind. In this work, we study the radial dependence of the laminar wind solution using local shearing-box simulations. Scaling relation on the angular momentum transport for the laminar wind is obtained, and we find that the wind-driven accretion rate can be approximated as M_dot~0.91x10^(-8)R_AU^(1.21)(B_z/10mG)^(0.93)M_Sun/yr, where B_z is the strength of the large-scale vertical magnetic field threading the disk. The result is independent of disk surface density. Four criteria are outlined for the existence of the laminar wind solution: 1). Ohmic resistivity dominated midplane region; 2). AD dominated disk upper layer; 3). Presence of (not too weak) net vertical magnetic flux. 4). Sufficiently well ionized gas beyond disk surface. All these criteria are likely to be met in the inner region of the disk from ~0.3 AU to about 5-10 AU for typical PPD accretion rates. Beyond this radius, angular momentum transport is likely to proceed due to a combination of the MRI and disk wind, and eventually dominated by the MRI (in the presence of strong AD) in the outer disk. Our simulation results provide key ingredients for a new paradigm on the accretion processes in PPDs. ";"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)"

The mid-transit times are $5.6\sigma$ earlier than those of the unverified transit-like signals reported in 2011, and we find no connection between the two sets of events. The transit depth together with our determined stellar radius ($R_\star = 0.703^{+0.039}_{-0.034} R_\odot$) indicates a 2.34$^{+0.18}_{-0.15}$ $R_{\oplus}$ super-Earth. When combined with the radial velocity determined mass of 7.86 $\pm 0.73$ $M_{\oplus}$, our radius measure allows us to derive a planet density of 3.44$^{+0.91}_{-0.82}$ g cm$^{-3}$. Models suggest that a planet with our measured density has a rocky core that is enveloped in an atmosphere composed of lighter elements. The star of the HD 97658 system is the second brightest known to host a transiting super-Earth, facilitating follow-up studies of this not easily daunted, warm and likely volatile-rich exoplanet. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

We achieve typical contrasts of ~10^5 at 1"" and ~10^6 beyond 2"" around 63 proposed members of nearby kinematic moving groups. We review each of the kinematic associations to which our targets belong, concluding that five, \beta Pictoris (~20 Myr), AB Doradus (~100 Myr), Columba (~30 Myr), Tucana-Horogium (~30 Myr), TW Hydrae (~10 Myr), are sufficiently well-defined to constrain the ages of individual targets. Somewhat less than half of our targets are high-probability members of one of these moving groups. For all of our targets, we combine proposed moving group membership with other age indicators where available, including Ca II HK emission, X-ray activity, and rotation period, to produce a posterior probability distribution of age. SEEDS observations discovered a substellar companion to one of our targets, \kappa And, a late B star. We do not detect any other substellar companions, but do find seven new close binary systems, of which one still needs to be confirmed. A detailed analysis of the statistics of this sample, and of the companion mass constraints given our age probability distributions and exoplanet cooling models, will be presented in a forthcoming paper.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.7330;Highly inclined and eccentric massive planets I: Planet-disc  interactions; Bertram Bitsch,  AurÃ©lien Crida,  Anne-Sophie Libert,  Elena Lega;  In the Solar System, planets have a small inclination with respect to the equatorial plane of the Sun, but there is evidence that in extrasolar systems the inclination can be very high. This spin-orbit misalignment is unexpected, as planets form in a protoplanetary disc supposedly aligned with the stellar spin. Planet-planet interactions are supposed to lead to a mutual inclination, but the effects of the protoplanetary disc are still unknown. We investigate therefore planet-disc interactions for planets above 1M_Jup. We check the influence of the inclination i, eccentricity e, and mass M_p of the planet. We perform 3D numerical simulations of protoplanetary discs with embedded high-mass planets. We provide damping formulae for i and e as a function of i, e, and M_p that fit the numerical data. For highly inclined massive planets, the gap opening is reduced, and the damping of i occurs on time-scales of the order of 10^-4 deg/yr M_disc/(0.01 M_star) with the damping of e on a smaller time-scale. While the inclination of low planetary masses (<5M_Jup) is always damped, large planetary masses with large i can undergo a Kozai-cycle with the disc. These Kozai-cycles are damped in time. Eccentricity is generally damped, except for very massive planets (M_p = 5M_Jup) where eccentricity can increase for low inclinations. The dynamics tends to a final state: planets end up in midplane and can then, over time, increase their eccentricity as a result of interactions with the disc. The interactions with the disc lead to damping of i and e after a scattering event of high-mass planets. If i is sufficiently reduced, the eccentricity can be pumped up because of interactions with the disc. If the planet is scattered to high inclination, it can undergo a Kozai-cycle with the disc that makes it hard to predict the exact movement of the planet and its orbital parameters at the dispersal of the disc. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Kenworthy;"  Direct imaging has just started the inventory of the population of gas giant planets on wide-orbits around young stars in the solar neighborhood. Following this approach, we carried out a deep imaging survey in the near-infrared using VLT/NaCo to search for substellar companions. We report here the discovery in L' (3.8 microns) images of a probable companion orbiting at 56 AU the young (10-17 Myr), dusty, and early-type (A8) star HD 95086. This discovery is based on observations with more than a year-time-lapse. Our first epoch clearly revealed the source at 10 sigma while our second epoch lacked good observing conditions hence yielding a 3 sigma detection. Various tests were thus made to rule out possible artifacts. This recovery is consistent with the signal at the first epoch but requires cleaner confirmation. Nevertheless, our astrometric precision suggests the companion to be comoving with the star, with a 3 sigma confidence level. The planetary nature of the source is reinforced by a non-detection in Ks-band (2.18 microns) images according to its possible extremely red Ks - L' color. Conversely, background contamination is rejected with good confidence level. The luminosity yields a predicted mass of about 4-5MJup (at 10-17 Myr) using ""hot-start"" evolutionary models, making HD 95086 b the exoplanet with the lowest mass ever imaged around a star.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.7508;Possible scenarios for eccentricity evolution in the extrasolar  planetary system HD 181433; Giammarco Campanella,  Richard P. Nelson,  Craig B. Agnor;  We analyse the dynamics of the multiple planet system HD 181433. This consists of two gas giant planets (c and d) with msin i = 0.65 MJup and 0.53 MJup orbiting with periods 975 and 2468 days, respectively. The two planets appear to be in a 5:2 mean motion resonance, as this is required for the system to be dynamically stable. A third planet with mass m_b sin i = 0.023 MJup orbits close to the star with orbital period 9.37 days. Each planet orbit is significantly eccentric, with current values estimated to be e_b = 0.39, e_c = 0.27 and e_d = 0.47. In this paper we assess different scenarios that may explain the origin of these eccentric orbits, with particular focus on the innermost body, noting that the large eccentricity of planet b cannot be explained through secular interaction with the outer pair. We consider a scenario in which the system previously contained an additional giant planet that was ejected during a period of dynamical instability among the planets. N-body simulations are presented that demonstrate that during scattering and ejection among the outer planets a close encounter between a giant and the inner body can raise e_b to its observed value. We consider the possibility that an undetected planet in the system increases the secular forcing of planet b by the exterior giant planets, but we find that the resulting eccentricity is not large enough to agree with the observed one. We also consider a scenario in which the spin-down of the central star causes the system to pass through secular resonance. Spin-down rates below the critical value lead to longterm capture of planet b in secular resonance, driving the eccentricity toward unity. If additional short-period low mass planets are present in the system, however, we find that mutual scattering can release planet b from the secular resonance, leading to a system with orbital parameters similar to those observed today. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

(2014) first reported as a young directly imaged planet-mass companion. ROXs 42Bb exhibits IR colors redder than field L dwarfs but consistent with other planet-mass companions. From the H$_{2}$O-2 spectral index, we estimate a spectral type of L0 $\pm$ 1; weak detections/non-detections of the $CO$ bandheads, $Na I$, and $Ca I$ support evidence for a young, low surface gravity object primarily derived from the $H_{2}$(K) index. ROXs 42Bb's photometry/K-band spectrum are inconsistent with limiting cases of dust-free atmospheres ($COND$) and marginally inconsistent with the AMES/DUSTY models and the BT-SETTL models. However, ROXS 42Bb data are simultaneously fit by atmosphere models incorporating several micron-sized dust grains entrained in thick clouds, although further modifications are needed to better reproduce the $K$-band spectral shape. ROXs 42Bb's best-estimated temperature is $T_{eff}$ $\sim$ 1950--2000 $K$, near the low end of the empirically-derived range in Currie et al. (2014). For an age of $\sim$ 1--3 $Myr$ and considering the lifetime of the protostar phase, ROXs 42Bb's luminosity of log($L$/$L_{\odot}$) $\sim$ -3.07 $\pm$ 0.07 implies a mass of 9$^{+3}_{-3}$ $M_{J}$, making it one of the lightest planetary mass objects yet imaged.

We measure an unambiguous fundamental period of 6.2562 +/- 0.002 d, within 0.02% of half the orbital period (Porb = 12.50995 +/- 0.00036 d) determined earlier from HST observations resolving the binary. The light curve is double-peaked, and well fit by the sum of two sinusoids: a primary with period Porb/2 and peak-to-peak amplitude 0.120 +/- 0.012 mag and a secondary with period Porb and peak-to-peak amplitude 0.044 +/- 0.010 mag. Excluding observations within ~0.1 deg of opposition, we measure a linear solar phase dependence with slope 0.147 +/- 0.018 mag deg-1 and a mean absolute magnitude in the Gunn g band of 6.100 +/- 0.006 mag. There is no rotational color variation exceeding 4%. We also observe that eclipses occur centered on light curve minima to within 0.3%, requiring the long axis of at least one of the two bodies to point precisely toward the other. Assuming the binary is doubly synchronous and both rotation axes are aligned with the orbital angular momentum vector, our observations jointly constrain triaxial shape models for Sila and Nunam such that the product of their long-to-intermediate axes ratios is 1.120 +/- 0.01. Hence both bodies are elongated by 6%, or else one is elongated by 6% to 12%, and the other by less than 6%. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

This time, the presence of a super-Earth with mass $m_{\rm X} = 2-15m_{\oplus}$ at a distance $d_{\rm X}\approx 200-300$ astronomical units (AU) was proposed to explain the observed clustering of the arguments of perihelion $\omega$ near $\omega \approx 0^{\circ}$ but not $\omega\approx 180^{\circ}$ for Sedna, 2012 VP$_{\rm 113}$ and other minor bodies of the Solar System with perihelion distances $q>30$ AU and semimajor axes $a>150$ AU. Actually, such a scenario is strongly disfavored by the latest constraints $\Delta\dot\varpi$ on the anomalous perihelion precessions of some Solar System's planets obtained with the INPOP and EPM ephemerides. Indeed, they yield $d_{\rm X}\gtrsim 496-570$ AU ($m_{\rm X}=2m_{\oplus}$), and $d_{\rm X}\gtrsim 970-1111$ AU ($m_{\rm X} = 15 m_{\oplus}$).

[...] Assuming fractional crystallization of the magma ocean, dense cumulates are produced close to the surface, largely due to iron enrichment in the evolving magma ocean liquid (Elkins-Tanton et al., 2003). A gravitationally unstable mantle thus forms, which is prone to overturn. We investigate the cumulate overturn and its influence on the thermal evolution of Mars using mantle convection simulations in 2D cylindrical geometry. We present a suite of simulations using different initial conditions and a strongly temperature-dependent viscosity. We assume that all radiogenic heat sources have been enriched during the freezing-phase of the magma ocean in the uppermost 50 km and that the initial steam-atmosphere created by the degassing of the freezing magma ocean was rapidly lost, implying that the surface temperature is set to present-day values. In this case, a stagnant lid forms rapidly on top of the convective interior preventing the uppermost dense cumulates to sink, even when allowing for a plastic yielding mechanism. Below this dense stagnant lid, the mantle chemical gradient settles to a stable configuration. The convection pattern is dominated by small-scale structures, which are difficult to reconcile with the large-scale volcanic features observed over Mars' surface and partial melting ceases in less than 900 Ma. Assuming that the stagnant lid can break because of additional mechanisms and allowing the uppermost dense layer to overturn, a stable density gradient is obtained, with the densest material and the entire amount of heat sources lying above the CMB. This stratification leads to a strong overheating of the lowermost mantle [...] ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Geophysics (physics.geo-ph)"

Krot (1),  Joseph I. Goldstein (2),  Shigeru Wakita (1 and 3) ((1) Univ. Hawaii, (2) Univ. Massachusetts, (3) CfCA NAO Tokyo);  We have studied cloudy taenite, metallographic cooling rates, and shock effects in 30 H3-6 chondrites to elucidate the thermal and early impact history of the H chondrite parent body. We focused on H chondrites with Ar-Ar ages greater than 4.4 Gyr and unshocked and mildly shocked H chondrites, as strongly shocked chondrites with such old ages are very rare. Cooling rates for most H chondrites at 500 C are 10-50 C/Myr and do not decrease systematically with increasing petrologic type as predicted by the onion-shell model in which types 3 to 5 are arranged in concentric layers around a type 6 core. Some type 4 chondrites cooled slower than some type 6 chondrites and type 3 chondrites did not cool faster than other types, contrary to the onion-shell model. Cloudy taenite particle sizes, which range from 40 to 120 nm, are inversely correlated with metallographic cooling rates and show that the latter were not compromised by shock heating. The three H4 chondrites that were used to develop the onion-shell model, Ste. Marguerite, Beaver Creek, and Forest Vale, cooled through 500 C at ~5000 C/Myr. Our thermal modeling shows that these rates are 50 times higher than could be achieved in a body that was heated by 26Al and cooled without disturbance by impact. Published Ar-Ar ages do not decrease systematically with increasing petrologic type but do correlate inversely with cloudy taenite particle size suggesting that impact mixing decreased during metamorphism. Metal and silicate compositions in regolith breccias show that impacts mixed material after metamorphism without causing significant heating. Impacts during metamorphism created Portales Valley and two other H6 chondrites with large metallic veins, excavated the fast-cooled H4 chondrites around 3-4 Myr after accretion, and mixed petrologic types. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.0641;Age Aspects of Habitability; M. Safonova,  J. Murthy,  Yu. A. Shchekinov;  A habitable zone of a star is defined as a range of orbits within which a rocky planet can support liquid water on its surface. The most intriguing question driving the search for habitable planets is whether they host life. But is the age of the planet important for its habitability? If we define habitability as the ability of a planet to beget life, then probably not. After all, life on Earth has developed within only about 800 Myr after its formation. If, however, we define habitability as our ability to detect life on the surface of exoplanets, then age becomes a crucial parameter. Only after life had evolved sufficiently complex to change its environment on a planetary scale, can we detect it remotely through its imprint on the atmosphere - the biosignatures, out of which the photosynthetic oxygen is the most prominent indicator of developed life as we know it. But the onset of photosynthesis on planets in habitable zones may take much longer time than the planetary age. The knowledge of the age of a planet is necessary for developing a strategy to search for exoplanets carrying complex (developed) life - many confirmed potentially habitable planets are too young (orbiting Population I stars) and may not have had enough time to develop and/or sustain detectable life. In the last decade, many planets orbiting old (9-13 Gyr) metal-poor Population II stars have been discovered. Such planets had had enough time to develop necessary chains of chemical reactions and may carry detectable life if located in a habitable zone. These old planets should be primary targets in search for the extraterrestrial life. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Thi,  G. Meeus,  W. R. F. Dent;"  Transitional disks are protoplanetary disks characterized by reduced near- and mid-infrared emission with respect to full disks. This characteristic spectral energy distribution indicates the presence of an optically thin inner cavity within the dust disk believed to mark the disappearance of the primordial massive disk. We present new Herschel Space Observatory PACS spectra of [OI] 63 micron for 21 transitional disks. Our survey complements the larger Herschel GASPS program ""Gas in Protoplanetary Systems"" (Dent et al. 2013) by quadrupling the number of transitional disks observed with PACS at this wavelength. [OI] 63 micron traces material in the outer regions of the disk, beyond the inner cavity of most transitional disks. We find that transitional disks have [OI] 63 micron line luminosities two times fainter than their full disk counterparts. We self consistently determine various stellar properties (e.g. bolometric luminosity, FUV excess, etc.) and disk properties (e.g. disk dust mass, etc.) that could influence the [OI] 63 micron line luminosity and we find no correlations that can explain the lower [OI] 63 micron line luminosities in transitional disks. Using a grid of thermo-chemical protoplanetary disk models, we conclude that either transitional disks are less flared than full disks or they possess lower gas-to-dust ratios due to a depletion of gas mass. This result suggests that transitional disks are more evolved than their full disk counterparts, possibly even at large radii.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.0800;Rotation of cometary meteoroids; David Capek;"  The aim of this study is to estimate the rotational characteristics of meteoroids after their release from a comet during normal activity. The results can serve as initial conditions for further analyses of subsequent evolution of rotation in the interplanetary space. A sophisticated numerical model was applied to meteoroids ejected from 2P/Encke comet. The meteoroid shapes were approximated by polyhedrons with several thousands of surface elements, which have been determined by 3D laser scanning method of 36 terrestrial rock samples. These samples came from three distinct sets with different origin and shape characteristics. Two types of gas-meteoroid interactions (diffuse and specular reflection of gas molecules from the surface of meteoroid) and three gas ejection models (leading to very different ejection velocities) were assumed. The rotational characteristics of ejected meteoroid population were obtained by numerical integration of equations of motion with random initial conditions and random shape selection. It was proved, that the results do not depend on specific set of shape models and that they are applicable to (unknown) shapes of real meteoroids. A simple relationship between median of meteoroid spin frequencies $\bar{f}$ (Hz), ejection velocities $v_{\rm ej}$ (m s$^{-1}$) and sizes $D$ (m) was determined. For diffuse reflection of gas molecules from meteoroid's surface it is: $\bar{f}\simeq 2\times 10^{-3} v_{\rm ej} D^{-0.88}$, and for specular reflection of gas molecules from meteoroid's surface it is: $\bar{f}\simeq 5\times 10^{-3} v_{\rm ej} D^{-0.88}$. The distribution of spin frequencies is relatively wide; $2\sigma$-interval can be described as $\sim(0.1, 10)\times \bar{f}$. The results were determined for 2P/Encke comet, but it was shown that their validity is general. ";Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.0801;Dynamics of rotationally fissioned asteroids: Source of observed small  asteroid systems; Seth A Jacobson,  Daniel J Scheeres;"  We present a model of near-Earth asteroid (NEA) rotational fission and ensuing dynamics that describes the creation of synchronous binaries and all other observed NEA systems including: doubly synchronous binaries, high- e binaries, ternary systems, and contact binaries. Our model only presupposes the Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (YORP) effect, ""rubble pile"" asteroid geophysics, and gravitational interactions. The YORP effect torques a ""rubble pile"" asteroid until the asteroid reaches its fission spin limit and the components enter orbit about each other (Scheeres, D.J. [2007]. Icarus 189, 370-385). Non-spherical gravitational potentials couple the spin states to the orbit state and chaotically drive the system towards the observed asteroid classes along two evolutionary tracks primarily distinguished by mass ratio. Related to this is a new binary process termed secondary fission - the secondary asteroid of the binary system is rotationally accelerated via gravitational torques until it fissions, thus creating a chaotic ternary system. The initially chaotic binary can be stabilized to create a synchronous binary by components of the fissioned secondary asteroid impacting the primary asteroid, solar gravitational perturbations, and mutual body tides. These results emphasize the importance of the initial component size distribution and configuration within the parent asteroid. NEAs may go through multiple binary cycles and many YORP-induced rotational fissions during their approximately 10 Myr lifetime in the inner Solar System. Rotational fission and the ensuing dynamics are responsible for all NEA systems including the most commonly observed synchronous binaries. ";Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Udry;  It is well-known that stars with giant planets are on average more metal-rich than stars without giant planets, whereas stars with detected low-mass planets do not need to be metal-rich. With the aim of studying the weak boundary that separates giant planets and brown dwarfs (BDs) and their formation mechanism, we analyze the spectra of a sample of stars with already confirmed BD companions both by radial velocity and astrometry. We employ standard and automatic tools to perform an EW-based analysis and to derive chemical abundances from CORALIE spectra of stars with BD companions. We compare these abundances with those of stars without detected planets and with low-mass and giant-mass planets. We find that stars with BDs do not have metallicities and chemical abundances similar to those of giant-planet hosts but they resemble the composition of stars with low-mass planets. The distribution of mean abundances of $\alpha$-elements and iron peak elements of stars with BDs exhibit a peak at about solar abundance whereas for stars with low-mass and high-mass planets the [X$_\alpha$/H] and [X$_{\rm Fe}$/H] peak abundances remain at $\sim -0.1$~dex and $\sim +0.15$~dex, respectively. We display these element abundances for stars with low-mass and high-mass planets, and BDs versus the minimum mass, $m_C \sin i$, of the most-massive substellar companion in each system, and we find a maximum in $\alpha$-element as well as Fe-peak abundances at $m_C \sin i \sim 1.35\pm 0.20$ jupiter masses. We discuss the implication of these results in the context of the formation scenario of BDs in comparison with that of giant planets. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)"

The experiments were conducted in a high vacuum chamber at heavy ions accelerator GANIL, in Caen, France. The samples were bombarded at two temperatures (14 K and 300 K) by $^{58}$Ni$^{11+}$ ions of 46 MeV until the final fluence of $10^{13}$ ions cm$^{-2}$. The chemical evolution of the sample was evaluated in-situ using Fourrier Transformed Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer. The bombardment at 14 K produced several daughter species such as OCN$^-$, CO, CO$_2$, and CN$^-$. The results also suggest the appearing of peptide bonds during irradiation but this must be confirmed by further experiments. The halflives of glycine in Interstellar Medium were estimated to be 7.8 $\times 10^3$ years (300 K) and 2.8 $\times 10^3$ years (14 K). In the Solar System the values were 8.4 $\times 10^2$ years (300 K) and 3.6 $\times 10^3$ years (14 K). It is believed that glycine could be present in space environments that suffered aqueous changes such as the interior of comets, meteorites and planetesimals.

Here, we use a particles-in-cell code to predict the transit of the plasma torus produced by a satellite. Despite the small size of a moon, the spatial extent of its plasma torus can be large enough to produce substantial transit absorptions. The model is used for the interpretation of Hubble Space Telescope early ingress absorptions apparently observed during WASP-12b and HD 189733b UV transits for which no consistent explanation exists. For HD 189733b an exomoon transiting $\sim 16$ $R_p$ ahead of the planet and loading $\sim 10^{29}$ C II ions/s into space is required to explain the tentative early ingress absorption observed for C II. For WASP-12b, a moon transiting $\sim 6$ $R_p$ ahead from the planet and ejecting $\sim 10^{28}$ Mg II ions per second is required to explain the NUV early ingress absorption feature. Interestingly, both HD 189733b and WASP-12b predicted satellites are outside the Hill sphere of their planets, an indication that the moons, if present, were not formed in situ but probably captured later. Finally, our simulations show a strong electromagnetic coupling between the polar regions of planets and the orbital position of the moons, an expected outcome of the unipolar induction DC circuit model. Future observations should test our predictions with a potential opportunity to unambiguously detect the first exomoon plasma torus. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

The mean bulk and grain densities were determined to be 3.43 g/cm$^\text{3}$ with standard deviation (s.d.) of 0.11 g/cm$^\text{3}$ and 3.79 g/cm$^\text{3}$ with s.d. 0.07 g/cm$^\text{3}$, respectively. Porosity is in the range from 4.2 to 16.1%. The logarithm of the apparent magnetic susceptibility (in 10$^\text{-9}$ m$^\text{3}$/kg) shows narrow distribution from 5.17 to 5.49 with mean value at 5.35 with s.d. 0.08. These results indicate that all studied Ko\v{s}ice meteorites are of the same composition down to ~g scale without presence of foreign (non-H) clasts and are similar to other H chondrites. Ko\v{s}ice is thus a homogeneous meteorite fall derived from a homogeneous meteoroid. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Chapman,  Caleb I. Fassett,  Robert R. Herrick,  Kelsi Singer,  Michael Zanetti,  Cory Lehan,  Di Huang,  Pamela L. Gay;  The identification of impact craters on planetary surfaces provides important information about their geological history. Most studies have relied on individual analysts who map and identify craters and interpret crater statistics. However, little work has been done to determine how the counts vary as a function of technique, terrain, or between researchers. Furthermore, several novel internet-based projects ask volunteers with little to no training to identify craters, and it was unclear how their results compare against the typical professional researcher. To better understand the variation among experts and to compare with volunteers, eight professional researchers have identified impact features in two separate regions of the moon. Small craters (diameters ranging from 10 m to 500 m) were measured on a lunar mare region and larger craters (100s m to a few km in diameter) were measured on both lunar highlands and maria. Volunteer data were collected for the small craters on the mare. Our comparison shows that the level of agreement among experts depends on crater diameter, number of craters per diameter bin, and terrain type, with differences of up to $\sim\pm45%$. We also found artifacts near the minimum crater diameter that was studied. These results indicate that caution must be used in most cases when interpreting small variations in crater size-frequency distributions and for craters $\le10$ pixels across. Because of the natural variability found, projects that emphasize many people identifying craters on the same area and using a consensus result are likely to yield the most consistent and robust information. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Chauvin,  A.-M. Lagrange,  M. Bonnefoy,  S. Desidera,  M. Sylvestre,  P. Baudoz,  R. Galicher,  D. Mouillet;  Spectral differential imaging (SDI) is part of the observing strategy of current and on-going high-contrast imaging instruments on ground-based telescopes. Although it improves the star light rejection, SDI attenuates the signature of off-axis companions to the star, just like angular differential imaging (ADI). However, the attenuation due to SDI has the peculiarity of being dependent on the spectral properties of the companions. To date, no study has investigated these effects. Our team is addressing this problem based on data from a direct imaging survey of 16 stars combining the phase-mask coronagraph, the SDI and the ADI modes of VLT/NaCo. The objective of the survey is to search for cool (Teff<1000-1300 K) giant planets at separations of 5-10 AU orbiting young, nearby stars (<200 Myr, <25 pc). The data analysis did not yield any detections. As for the estimation of the sensitivity limits of SDI-processed images, we show that it requires a different analysis than that used in ADI-based surveys. Based on a method using the flux predictions of evolutionary models and avoiding the estimation of contrast, we determine directly the mass sensitivity limits of the survey for the ADI processing alone and with the combination of SDI and ADI. We show that SDI does not systematically improve the sensitivity due to the spectral properties and self-subtraction of point sources. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM)"

The appearance of the comet was peculiar, consisting of an envelope, a spherical coma near the nucleus and a tail extending in the anti-solar direction. We investigated the brightness and the morphological development of the comet by taking optical images with ground-based telescopes. Our observations show that V1 experienced a large-scale explosion between UT 2010 October 31 and November 3. The color of the comet was consistent with the Sun (g'-RC=0.61+-0.20, RC-IC=0.20+-0.20, and B-RC=0.93+-0.25), suggesting that dust particles were responsible for the brightening. We used a dynamical model to understand the peculiar morphology, and found that the envelope consisted of small grains (0.3-1 micron) expanding at a maximum speed of 500+-40 m/s, while the tail and coma were composed of a wider range of dust particle sizes (0.4-570 micron) and expansion speeds 7-390 m/s. The total mass of ejecta is ~5x10^8 kg and kinetic energy ~5x10^12 J. These values are much smaller than in the historic outburst of 17P/Holmes in 2007, but the energy per unit mass (1x10^4 J/kg) is comparable. The energy per unit mass is about 10% of the energy released during the crystallization of amorphous water ice suggesting that crystallization of buried amorphous ice can supply the mass and energy of the outburst ejecta. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

The DAM flux density exceeds 3,000 times the galactic background in the neighborhood of the Jovian icy moons, providing a signal that could be used for passive radio sounding. An instrument located between the icy moon and Jupiter could sample the DAM emission along with its echoes reflected in the ice layer of the target moon. Cross-correlating the direct emission with the echoes would provide a measurement of the ice shell thickness along with its dielectric properties. The interferometric reflectometer provides a simple solution to sub-Jovian radio sounding of ice shells that is complementary to ice penetrating radar measurements better suited to measurements in the anti-Jovian hemisphere that shadows Jupiter's strong decametric emission. The passive nature of this technique also serves as risk reduction in case of radar transmitter failure. The interferometric reflectometer could operate with electrically short antennas, thus extending ice depth measurements to lower frequencies, and potentially providing a deeper view into the ice shells of Jovian moons. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.1923;Linear stability of magnetized massive protoplanetary disks; Min-Kai Lin;"  Magneto-rotational instability (MRI) and gravitational instability (GI) are the two principle routes to turbulent angular momentum transport in accretion disks. Protoplanetary disks may develop both. This paper aims to reinvigorate interest in the study of magnetized massive protoplanetary disks, starting from the basic issue of stability. The local linear stability of a self-gravitating, uniformly magnetized, differentially rotating, three-dimensional stratified disk subject to axisymmetric perturbations is calculated numerically. The formulation includes resistivity. It is found that the reduction in the disk thickness by self-gravity can decrease MRI growth rates; the MRI becomes global in the vertical direction, and MRI modes with small radial length scales are stabilized. The maximum vertical field strength that permits the MRI in a strongly self-gravitating polytropic disk with polytropic index $\Gamma=1$ is estimated to be $B_{z,\mathrm{max}} \simeq c_{s0}\Omega\sqrt{\mu_0/16\pi G} $, where $c_{s0}$ is the midplane sound speed and $\Omega$ is the angular velocity. In massive disks with layered resistivity, the MRI is not well-localized to regions where the Elsasser number exceeds unity. For MRI modes with radial length scales on the order of the disk thickness, self-gravity can enhance density perturbations, an effect that becomes significant in the presence of a strong toroidal field, and which depends on the symmetry of the underlying MRI mode. In gravitationally unstable disks where GI and MRI growth rates are comparable, the character of unstable modes can transition smoothly between MRI and GI. Implications for non-linear simulations are discussed briefly. ";"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.1926;A simple bound for the variation at closest approach of a small body and  star due to general relativity; Dimitri Veras;  As a comet, asteroid or planet approaches its parent star, the orbit changes shape due to the curvature of spacetime. For comets in particular, the deviation at the pericentre may noticeably change their ephemerides and affect the dynamics of outgassing, tidal disruption or other processes which act on orbital timescales and are assumed to follow Newtonian gravity. By obtaining and analysing the unaveraged equations of motion in orbital elements due to the dominant post-Newtonian contribution (1PN), I derive a simple analytic expression for the maximum deviation in terms of only the stellar mass and eccentricity of the orbit. This relation can be used to assess the potential importance of including short-period relativistic terms in models containing comets, asteroids or planets, and help determine the level of precision needed in numerical integrations. The magnitude of the deviation in systems with Solar-like stars is typically comparable to the size of comet nuclei, and the direction of the deviation is determined by the eccentricity. I show that for eccentricities above a critical value of approximately 0.359, the direction is away from the star. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)"

Hubber,  J. M. Diederik Kruijssen,  Barbara Ercolano,  Stefanie Walch;  Most stars form in a clustered environment. Therefore, it is important to assess how this environment influences the evolution of protoplanetary discs around young stars. In turn, this affects their ability to produce planets and ultimately life. We present here for the first time 3D SPH/N-body simulations that include both the hydrodynamical evolution of the discs around their natal stars, as well as the dynamics of the stars themselves. The discs are viscously evolving, accreting mass onto the central star and spreading. We find penetrating encounters to be very destructive for the discs as in previous studies, although the frequency of such encounters is low. We also find, however, that encounter influence the disc radii more strongly than other disc properties such as the disc mass. The disc sizes are set by the competition between viscous spreading and the disruptive effect of encounters. As discs spread, encounters become more and more important. In the regime of rapid spreading encounters simply truncate the discs, stripping the outer portions. In the opposite regime, we find that the effect of many distant encounters is able to limit the disc size. Finally, we predict from our simulations that disc sizes are limited by encounters at stellar densities exceeding $\sim 2-3 \times 10^3 \ \mathrm{pc}^{-2}$. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.1954;On the steady state collisional evolution of debris disks around M  dwarfs; Etienne Morey,  Jean-Francois Lestrade;  Debris disks have been found primarily around intermediate and solar mass stars (spectral types A-K), but rarely around low-mass M-type stars. This scarcity of detections in M star surveys can be confronted with the predictions of the steady state collisional evolution model. First, we determine the parameters of the disk population evolved with this model and fit to the distribution of the fractional dust luminosities measured in the surveys of A- and FGK-type stars observed by the infrared satellite Spitzer. Thus, in our approach, we stipulate that the initial disk mass distribution is bimodal and that only high-mass collisionally-dominated disks are detected. The best determined parameter is the diameter $D_c$ of the largest planetesimals in the collisional cascade of the model, which ranges between 2 and 60 km, consistently for disks around A- and FGK-type stars. Second, we assume that the same disk population surrounds the M dwarfs that have been the subjects of debris disk searches in the far-infrared with Spitzer and at submillimeter wavelengths with radiotelescopes. We find, in the framework of our study, that this disk population, which has been fit to the AFGK data, is still consistent with the observed lack of disks around M dwarfs with Spitzer. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Stassun (1,3),  Joshua Pepper (4),  John Norris (5) ((1) Vanderbilt University, (2) University of Tampa, (3) Fisk University, (4) Lehigh University, (5) The Australian National University);"  Using high-resolution echelle spectra obtained with Magellan/MIKE, we present a chemical abundance analysis of both stars in the planet-hosting wide binary system HD20782 + HD20781. Both stars are G dwarfs, and presumably coeval, forming in the same molecular cloud. Therefore we expect that they should possess the same bulk metallicities. Furthermore, both stars also host giant planets on eccentric orbits with pericenters $\lesssim 0.2\,$ AU. We investigate if planets with such orbits could lead to the host stars ingesting material, which in turn may leave similar chemical imprints in their atmospheric abundances. We derived abundances of 15 elements spanning a range of condensation temperatures ($T_{C}\approx 40-1660\,$ K). The two stars are found to have a mean element-to-element abundance difference of $0.04\pm0.07\,$ dex, which is consistent with both stars having identical bulk metallicities. In addition, for both stars, the refractory elements ($T_{C} > 900\,$ K) exhibit a positive correlation between abundance (relative to solar) and $T_{C}$, with similar slopes of $\approx$ $1\times10^{-4}\,$ dex K$^{-1}$. The measured positive correlations are not perfect; both stars exhibit a scatter of $\approx$ $5\times10^{-5}\,$ dex K$^{-1}$ about the mean trend, and certain elements (Na, Al, Sc) are similarly deviant in both stars. These findings are discussed in the context of models for giant planet migration that predict the accretion of H-depleted rocky material by the host star. We show that a simple simulation of a solar-type star accreting material with Earth-like composition predicts a positive---but imperfect---correlation between refractory elemental abundances and $T_{C}$. Our measured slopes for HD 20782/81 are consistent with what is predicted for the ingestion of 10--20 Earths by both stars.

Vidal-Madjar;  Transit observations in the MgI line of HD209458b revealed signatures of neutral magnesium escaping the upper atmosphere of the planet, while no atmospheric absorption was found in the MgII doublet. Here we present a 3D particle model of the dynamics of neutral and ionized magnesium populations, coupled with an analytical modeling of the atmosphere below the exobase. Theoretical MgI absorption line profiles are directly compared with the absorption observed in the blue wing of the line during the planet transit. Observations are well-fitted with an escape rate of neutral magnesium in the range 2x10^7-3.4x10^7 g/s, an exobase close to the Roche lobe (Rexo in the range 2.1-4.3 Rp, where Rp is the planet radius) and a planetary wind velocity at the exobase vpl=25km/s. The observed velocities of the planet-escaping magnesium up to -60km/s are well explained by radiation pressure acceleration, provided that UV-photoionization is compensated for by electron recombination up to about 13Rp. If the exobase properties are constrained to values given by theoretical models of the deeper atmosphere (Rexo=2Rp and vpl=10km/s), the best fit to the observations is found at a similar electron density and escape rate within 2 sigma. In all cases, the mean temperature of the atmosphere below the exobase must be higher than about 6100 K. Simulations predict a redward expansion of the absorption profile from the beginning to the end of the transit. The spatial and spectral structure of the extended atmosphere is the result of complex interactions between radiation pressure, planetary gravity, and self-shielding, and can be probed through the analysis of transit absorption profiles in the MgI line. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.2159;Hyperbolic meteors: interstellar or generated locally via the  gravitational slingshot effect?; Paul A. Wiegert (University of Western Ontario);"  The arrival of solid particles from outside our solar system would present us with an invaluable source of scientific information. Attempts to detect such interstellar particles among the meteors observed in Earth's atmosphere have almost exclusively assumed that those particles moving above the Solar System's escape speed -- particles on orbits hyperbolic with respect to the Sun-- were precisely the extrasolar particles being searched for. Here we show that hyperbolic particles can be generated entirely within the Solar System by gravitational scattering of interplanetary dust and meteoroids by the planets. These particles have necessarily short lifetimes as they quickly escape our star system; nonetheless some may arrive at Earth at speeds comparable to those expected of interstellar meteoroids. Some of these are associated with the encounter of planets with the debris streams of individual comets; however, such encounters are relatively rare. The rates of occurrence of hyperbolically-scattered sporadic meteors are also quite low. Only one of every 10,000 optical meteors observed at Earth is expected to be such a locally generated hyperbolic and its heliocentric velocity is typically only a hundred meters per second above the heliocentric escape velocity at Earth's orbit. Mercury and Venus are predicted to generate weak 'hyperbolic meteor showers': the restrictive geometry of scattering to our planet means that a radiant near the Sun from which hyperbolic meteors arrive at Earth should recur with the planet's synodic period. However, though planetary scattering can produce meteoroids with speeds comparable to interstellar meteors and at fluxes near current upper limits for such events, the majority of this locally-generated component of hyperbolic meteoroids is just above the heliocentric escape velocity and should be easily distinguishable from true interstellar meteoroids.

Methods: Using PACS, we obtained the spectral emission of several features of the Titan's stratosphere. We used a line-by-line radiative transfer code and the least-squares fitting technique to infer the abundances of the trace constituents. Results: Numerous spectral features attributable to CH$_4$, CO, HCN, and H$_2$O are present. From the flux density spectrum measured and by a detailed comparison with synthetic spectra, we constrain the stratospheric abundance of CH4, which is assumed to be constant with altitude, to be 1.29 $\pm$ 0.03%. Similarly, we constrain the abundance of CO to be 50 $\pm$ 2 ppm, and the HCN vertical distribution consistent with an increase from 40 ppb at $\sim$100 km to 4 ppm at $\sim$200 km, which is an altitude region where the HCN signatures are sensitive. Measurements of three H$_2$O rotational lines confirm the H$_2$O distribution profile recently obtained with Herschel. Furthermore, we determine the isotopic ratios $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C in CO and HCN to be 124 $\pm$ 58, and 66 $\pm$ 35, respectively. Comparisons between our results and the values derived with other instruments show that our results are consistent with the vertical distributions and isotopic ratios in previous studies, except for the HCN distribution obtained with Cassini/CIRS, which does not agree with the PACS lines at the 1-sigma confidence interval. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Lecacheux;  The charge released by impact ionization of fast dust grains impinging on spacecraft is at the basis of a well-known technique for dust detection by wave instruments. Since most of the impact charges are recollected by the spacecraft, monopole antennas generally detect a much greater signal than dipoles. This is illustrated by comparing dust signals in monopole and dipole mode on different spacecraft and environments. It explains the weak sensitivity of Wind/WAVES dipole antennas for dust detection, so that it is not surprising that this instrument did not detect the interplanetary nanodust discovered by STEREO/WAVES. We propose an interpretation of the Wind dust data, elsewhere discussed by Malaspina et al. (2014), which explains the observed pulse amplitude and polarity for interstellar dust impacts, as well as the non-detection of nanodust. This proposed mechanism might be the dominant dust detection mechanism by some wave instruments using dipole antennas. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.2552;The Exoplanet Orbital Eccentricity - Multiplicity Relation and the Solar  System; Mary Anne Limbach,  Edwin L. Turner;  The known population of exoplanets exhibits a much wider range of orbital eccentricities than Solar System planets and has a much higher average eccentricity. These facts have been widely interpreted to indicate that the Solar System is an atypical member of the overall population of planetary systems. We report here on a strong anti-correlation of orbital eccentricity with multiplicity (number of planets in the system) among catalogued radial velocity (RV) systems. The mean, median and rough distribution of eccentricities of Solar System planets fits an extrapolation of this anti-correlation to the eight planet case rather precisely despite the fact that no more than 2 Solar System planets would be detectable with RV data comparable to that in the exoplanet sample. Moreover, even if regarded as a single or double planetary system, the Solar System lies in a reasonably heavily populated region of eccentricity-multiplicity space. Thus, the Solar System is not anomalous among known exoplanetary systems with respect to eccentricities when its multiplicity is taken into account. Specifically, as the multiplicity of a system increases the eccentricity decreases roughly as a power law of index -1.20. A simple and plausible but ad hoc and model-dependent interpretation of this relationship implies that approximately 80% of the one planet and 25% of the two planet systems in our sample have additional, as yet undiscovered, members but that systems of higher observed multiplicity are largely complete (i.e., relatively rarely contain additional undiscovered planets). If low eccentricities indeed favor high multiplicities, habitability may be more common in systems with a larger number of planets. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Lisse,  Michael S. Kelley,  Laura M. Woodney;  Comet C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp) has provided an unprecedented opportunity to observe a bright comet over a wide range of heliocentric distances. We present here Spitzer Space Telescope observations of Hale-Bopp from 2005 and 2008 that show a distinct coma and tail, the presence of which is uncommon given its large heliocentric distance (21.6 AU and 27.2 AU, respectively). The morphology of the dust is compared to dynamical models to understand the activity of the comet. Our analysis shows that the shape of Hale-Bopp's dust tail in these images cannot be explained using the usual Finson-Probstein (solar gravity + solar radiation pressure) dynamical model. Several alternative explanations are explored. The analysis suggests that the most likely cause of the discrepancy is that the dust is being charged by the solar wind, then being affected by the interplanetary magnetic field via the Lorentz force. Though this effect has been explored previously, if correct, this seems to be the first time that the Lorentz force has been required to model a cometary dust tail. The analysis also suggests that Hale-Bopp was actively emitting particles when these images were taken, and the tail characteristics changed between observations. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Raymond,  Jean-Charles Augereau,  Chris W. Ormel;  High levels of exozodiacal dust have been observed in the inner regions of a large fraction of main sequence stars. Given the short lifetime of the observed small dust grains, these 'exozodis' are difficult to explain, especially for old (>100 Myr) stars. The exozodiacal dust may be observed as excess emission in the mid-infrared, or using interferometry. We hypothesise that exozodi are sustained by planetesimals scattered by planets inwards from an outer planetesimal belt, where collision timescales are long. In this work, we use N-body simulations to show that the outwards migration of a planet into a belt, driven by the scattering of planetesimals, can increase, or sustain, the rate at which planetesimals are scattered from the outer belt to the exozodi region. We hypothesise that this increase is sufficient to sustain the observed exozodi on Gyr timescales. No correlation between observations of an outer belt and an exozodi is required for this scenario to work, as the outer belt may be too faint to detect. If planetesimal driven migration does explain the observed exozodi, this work suggests that the presence of an exozodi indicates the presence of outer planets and a planetesimal belt. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Here, we perform a comparative analysis of the orbital evolution of these transient co-orbitals to understand better how they got captured in the first place and what makes them dynamically unstable. We also look for additional temporary Uranian co-orbital candidates among known objects. Our N-body simulations show that the long-term stability of 2011 QF99 is controlled by Jupiter and Neptune; it briefly enters the 1:7 mean motion resonance with Jupiter and the 2:1 with Neptune before becoming a Trojan and prior to leaving its tadpole orbit. During these ephemeral two-body mean motion resonance episodes, apsidal corotation resonances are also observed. For known co-orbitals, Saturn is the current source of the main destabilizing force but this is not enough to eject a minor body from the 1:1 commensurability with Uranus. These objects must enter mean motion resonances with Jupiter and Neptune in order to be captured or become passing Centaurs. Asteroid 2010 EU65, a probable visitor from the Oort cloud, may have been stable for several Myr due to its comparatively low eccentricity. In addition, we show that the orbital properties and discovery circumstances of known objects can be used to outline a practical strategy by which additional Uranus' co-orbitals may be found.

SkÃ¡la,  G. Kletetschka,  J. KaÅ¡lÃ­k,  O. Malina,  K. Å iÅ¡kovÃ¡,  R. ZboÅil;  Airless planetary bodies are directly exposed to space weathering. The main spectral effects of space weathering are darkening, reduction in intensity of silicate mineral absorption bands, and an increase in the spectral slope towards longer wavelengths (reddening). Production of nanophase metallic iron (npFe$^{0}$) during space weathering plays major role in these spectral changes. A laboratory procedure for the controlled production of npFe$^{0}$ in silicate mineral powders has been developed. The method is based on a two-step thermal treatment of low-iron olivine, first in ambient air and then in hydrogen atmosphere. Through this process, a series of olivine powder samples was prepared with varying amounts of npFe$^{0}$ in the 7-20 nm size range. A logarithmic trend is observed between amount of npFe$^{0}$ and darkening, reduction of 1 {\mu}m olivine absorption band, reddening, and 1 {\mu}m band width. Olivine with a population of physically larger npFe$^{0}$ particles follows spectral trends similar to other samples, except for the reddening trend. This is interpreted as the larger, ~40-50 nm sized, npFe$^{0}$ particles do not contribute to the spectral slope change as efficiently as the smaller npFe$^{0}$ fraction. A linear trend is observed between the amount of npFe$^{0}$ and 1 {\mu}m band center position, most likely caused by Fe$^{2+}$ disassociation from olivine structure into npFe$^{0}$ particles. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Petigura,  Howard Isaacson,  Andrew W. Howard,  Lars A. Buchhave;"  Small planets, 1-4x the size of Earth, are extremely common around Sun-like stars, and surprisingly so, as they are missing in our solar system. Recent detections have yielded enough information about this class of exoplanets to begin characterizing their occurrence rates, orbits, masses, densities, and internal structures. The Kepler mission finds the smallest planets to be most common, as 26% of Sun-like stars have small, 1-2 R_e planets with orbital periods under 100 days, and 11% have 1-2 R_e planets that receive 1-4x the incident stellar flux that warms our Earth. These Earth-size planets are sprinkled uniformly with orbital distance (logarithmically) out to 0.4 AU, and probably beyond. Mass measurements for 33 transiting planets of 1-4 R_e show that the smallest of them, R < 1.5 R_e, have the density expected for rocky planets. Their densities increase with increasing radius, likely caused by gravitational compression. Including solar system planets yields a relation: rho = 2.32 + 3.19 R/R_e [g/cc]. Larger planets, in the radius range 1.5-4.0 R_e, have densities that decline with increasing radius, revealing increasing amounts of low-density material in an envelope surrounding a rocky core, befitting the appellation ""mini-Neptunes."" Planets of ~1.5 R_e have the highest densities, averaging near 10 g/cc. The gas giant planets occur preferentially around stars that are rich in heavy elements, while rocky planets occur around stars having a range of heavy element abundances. One explanation is that the fast formation of rocky cores in protoplanetary disks enriched in heavy elements permits the gravitational accumulation of gas before it vanishes, forming giant planets. But models of the formation of 1-4 R_e planets remain uncertain. Defining habitable zones remains difficult, without benefit of either detections of life elsewhere or an understanding of life's biochemical origins. ";Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.3157;Architectures of Planetary Systems and Implications for their Formation; Eric B. Ford (Penn State);  Doppler planet searches revealed that many giant planets orbit close to their host star or in highly eccentric orbits. These and subsequent observations inspired new theories of planet formation that invoke gravitation interactions in multiple planet systems to explain the excitation of orbital eccentricities and even short-period giant planets. Recently, NASA's Kepler mission has identified over 300 systems with multiple transiting planet candidates, including many potentially rocky planets. Most of these systems include multiple planets with closely-spaced orbits and sizes between that of Earth and Neptune. These systems represent yet another new and unexpected class of planetary systems and provide an opportunity to test the theories developed to explain the properties of giant exoplanets. Presently, we have limited knowledge about such planetary systems, mostly about their sizes and orbital periods. With the advent of long-term, nearly continuous monitoring by Kepler, the method of transit timing variations (TTVs) has blossomed as a new technique for characterizing the gravitational effects of mutual planetary perturbations for hundreds of planets. TTVs can provide precise (but complex) constraints on planetary masses, densities and orbits, even for planetary systems with faint host stars. In the coming years, astronomers will translate TTV observations into increasingly powerful constraints on the formation and orbital evolution of planetary systems with low-mass planets. Between TTVs, improved Doppler surveys, high-contrast imaging campaigns and microlensing surveys, astronomers can look forward to a much better understanding of planet formation in the coming decade. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.3213;Evaporation and Accretion of Extrasolar Comets Following White Dwarf  Kicks; Nicholas Stone,  Brian Metzger,  Abraham Loeb;"  Several lines of observational evidence suggest that white dwarfs receive small birth kicks due to anisotropic mass loss. If other stars possess extrasolar analogues to the Solar Oort cloud, the orbits of comets in such clouds will be scrambled by white dwarf natal kicks. Although most comets will be unbound, some will be placed on low angular momentum orbits vulnerable to sublimation or tidal disruption. The dusty debris from these comets will manifest itself as an IR excess temporarily visible around newborn white dwarfs; examples of such disks may already have been seen in the Helix Nebula, and around several other young white dwarfs. Future observations with the James Webb Space Telescope may distinguish this hypothesis from alternatives such as a dynamically excited Kuiper Belt analogue. Although competing hypotheses exist, the observation that $\gtrsim 15\%$ of young white dwarfs possess such disks, if interpreted as indeed being cometary in origin, provides indirect evidence that low mass gas giants (thought necessary to produce an Oort cloud) are common in the outer regions of extrasolar planetary systems. Hydrogen abundances in the atmospheres of older white dwarfs can, if sufficiently low, also be used to place constraints on the joint parameter space of natal kicks and exo-Oort cloud models.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.3271;Near-infrared emission from sublimating dust in collisionally active  debris disks; R. van Lieshout,  C. Dominik,  M. Kama,  M. Min;  Hot exozodiacal dust is thought to be responsible for excess near-infrared (NIR) emission emanating from the innermost parts of some debris disks. The origin of this dust, however, is still a matter of debate. We test whether hot exozodiacal dust can be supplied from an exterior parent belt by Poynting-Robertson (P-R) drag, paying special attention to the pile-up of dust that occurs due to the interplay of P-R drag and dust sublimation. Specifically, we investigate whether pile-ups still occur when collisions are taken into account, and if they can explain the observed NIR excess. We compute the steady-state distribution of dust in the inner disk by solving the continuity equation. First, we derive an analytical solution under a number of simplifying assumptions. Second, we develop a numerical debris disk model that for the first time treats the complex interaction of collisions, P-R drag, and sublimation in a self-consistent way. From the resulting dust distributions we generate thermal emission spectra and compare these to observed excess NIR fluxes. We confirm that P-R drag always supplies a small amount of dust to the sublimation zone, but find that a fully consistent treatment yields a maximum amount of dust that is about 7 times lower than that given by analytical estimates. The NIR excess due this material is much smaller (<10^-3 for A-type stars with parent belts at >1 AU) than the values derived from interferometric observations (~10^-2). Pile-up of dust still occurs when collisions are considered, but its effect on the NIR flux is insignificant. Finally, the cross-section in the innermost regions is clearly dominated by barely bound grains. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

By observing characteristic, rare deviations in the gravitational microlensing light curve one can discover that a lens is a star--planet system. In this paper we consider an opposite case where the lens is a single star and the source has a transiting planetary companion. We have studied the light curve of a source star with transiting companion magnified during microlensing event. Our model shows that in dense stellar fields, in which blending is significant, the light drop generated by transits is greater near the maximum of microlensing, which makes it easier to detect. We derive the probability for the detection of a planetary transit in a microlensed source to be of 2*10^(-6) for an individual microlensing event. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Rameau,  G. Chauvin,  A.-M. Lagrange,  M. Bonnefoy,  S. Desidera,  M. Sylvestre,  P. Baudoz,  R. Galicher,  D. Mouillet;  [Abridged] Context. Spectral differential imaging (SDI) is part of the observing strategy of current and future high-contrast imaging instruments. It aims to reduce the stellar speckles that prevent the detection of cool planets by using in/out methane-band images. It attenuates the signature of off-axis companions to the star, such as angular differential imaging (ADI). However, this attenuation depends on the spectral properties of the low-mass companions we are searching for. The implications of this particularity on estimating the detection limits have been poorly explored so far. Aims. We perform an imaging survey to search for cool (Teff<1000-1300 K) giant planets at separations as close as 5-10 AU. We also aim to assess the sensitivity limits in SDI data taking the photometric bias into account. This will lead to a better view of the SDI performance. Methods. We observed a selected sample of 16 stars (age < 200 Myr, d < 25 pc) with the phase-mask coronagraph, SDI, and ADI modes of VLT/NaCo. Results. We do not detect any companions. As for the sensitivity limits, we argue that the SDI residual noise cannot be converted into mass limits because it represents a differential flux, unlike the case of single-band images. This results in degeneracies for the mass limits, which may be removed with the use of single-band constraints. We instead employ a method of directly determining the mass limits. The survey is sensitive to cool giant planets beyond 10 AU for 65% and 30 AU for 100% of the sample. Conclusions. For close-in separations, the optimal regime for SDI corresponds to SDI flux ratios >2. According to the BT-Settl model, this translates into Teff<800 K. The methods described here can be applied to the data interpretation of SPHERE. We expect better performance with the dual-band imager IRDIS, thanks to more suitable filter characteristics and better image quality. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM)"

Meadows;  We explore the impact of obliquity variations on planetary habitability in hypothetical systems with high mutual inclination. We show that large amplitude, high frequency obliquity oscillations on Earth-like exoplanets can suppress the ice-albedo feedback, increasing the outer edge of the habitable zone. We restrict our exploration to hypothetical systems consisting of a solar-mass star, an Earth-mass planet at 1 AU, and 1 or 2 larger planets. We verify that these systems are stable for $10^8$ years with N-body simulations, and calculate the obliquity variations induced by the orbital evolution of the Earth-mass planet and a torque from the host star. We run a simplified energy balance model on the terrestrial planet to assess surface temperature and ice coverage on the planet's surface, and we calculate differences in the outer edge of the habitable zone for planets with rapid obliquity variations. For each hypothetical system, we calculate the outer edge of habitability for two conditions: 1) the full evolution of the planetary spin and orbit, and 2) the eccentricity and obliquity fixed at their average values. We recover previous results that higher values of fixed obliquity and eccentricity expand the habitable zone, but also find that obliquity oscillations further expand habitable orbits in all cases. Terrestrial planets near the outer edge of the habitable zone may be more likely to support life in systems that induce rapid obliquity oscillations as opposed to fixed-spin planets. Such planets may be the easiest to directly characterize with space-borne telescopes. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Snellen;  (Abridged) In recent years, ground-based high-resolution spectroscopy has become a powerful tool for investigating exoplanet atmospheres. It allows the robust identification of molecular species, and it can be applied to both transiting and non-transiting planets. Radial-velocity measurements of the star HD 179949 indicate the presence of a giant planet companion in a close-in orbit. Here we present the analysis of spectra of the system at 2.3 micron, obtained at a resolution of R~100,000, during three nights of observations with CRIRES at the VLT. We targeted the system while the exoplanet was near superior conjunction, aiming to detect the planet's thermal spectrum and the radial component of its orbital velocity. We detect molecular absorption from carbon monoxide and water vapor with a combined S/N of 6.3, at a projected planet orbital velocity of K_P = (142.8 +- 3.4) km/s, which translates into a planet mass of M_P = (0.98 +- 0.04) Jupiter masses, and an orbital inclination of i = (67.7 +- 4.3) degrees, using the known stellar radial velocity and stellar mass. The detection of absorption features rather than emission means that, despite being highly irradiated, HD 179949 b does not have an atmospheric temperature inversion in the probed range of pressures and temperatures. Since the host star is active (R_HK > -4.9), this is in line with the hypothesis that stellar activity damps the onset of thermal inversion layers owing to UV flux photo-dissociating high-altitude, optical absorbers. Finally, our analysis favors an oxygen-rich atmosphere for HD 179949 b, although a carbon-rich planet cannot be statistically ruled out based on these data alone. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.3858;Catastrophic ice lake collapse in Aram Chaos, Mars; Manuel Roda,  Maarten G. Kleinhans,  Tanja E. Zegers,  Jelmer H.P. Oosthoek;  Hesperian chaotic terrains have been recognized as the source of outflow channels formed by catastrophic outflows. Four main scenarios have been proposed for the formation of chaotic terrains that involve different amounts of water and single or multiple outflow events. Here, we test these scenarios with morphological and structural analyses of imagery and elevation data for Aram Chaos in conjunction with numerical modeling of the morphological evolution of the catastrophic carving of the outflow valley. The morphological and geological analyses of Aram Chaos suggest large-scale collapse and subsidence (1500 m) of the entire area, which is consistent with a massive expulsion of liquid water from the subsurface in one single event. The combined observations suggest a complex process starting with the outflow of water from two small channels, followed by continuous groundwater sapping and headward erosion and ending with a catastrophic lake rim collapse and carving of the Aram Valley, which is synchronous with the 2.5 Ga stage of the Ares Vallis formation. The water volume and formative time scale required to carve the Aram channels indicate that a single, rapid (maximum tens of days) and catastrophic (flood volume of 9.3?104 km3) event carved the outflow channel. We conclude that a sub-ice lake collapse model can best explain the features of the Aram Chaos Valley system as well as the time scale required for its formation. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Geophysics (physics.geo-ph)"

Ebel;  The Earth is known to be depleted in volatile lithophile elements in a fashion that defies easy explanation. We resolve this anomaly with a model that combines the porosity of collisionally grown dust grains in protoplanetary disks with heating from FU Orionis events that dramatically raise protoplanetary disk temperatures. The heating from an FU Orionis event alters the aerodynamical properties of the dust while evaporating the volatiles. This causes the dust to settle, abandoning those volatiles. The success of this model in explaining the elemental composition of the Earth is a strong argument in favor of highly porous collisionally grown dust grains in protoplanetary disks outside our Solar System. Further, it demonstrates how thermal (or condensation based) alterations of dust porosity, and hence aerodynamics, can be a strong factor in planet formation, leading to the onset of rapid gravitational instabilities in the dust disk and the subsequent collapse that forms planetesimals. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.4196;Will New Horizons see dust clumps in the Edgeworth-Kuiper belt?; Christian Vitense,  Alexander V. Krivov,  Torsten LÃ¶hne;  Debris disks are thought to be sculptured by neighboring planets. The same is true for the Edgeworth-Kuiper debris disk, yet no direct observational evidence for signatures of giant planets in the Kuiper belt dust distribution has been found so far. Here we model the dust distribution in the outer solar system to reproduce the dust impact rates onto the dust detector onboard the New Horizons spacecraft measured so far and to predict the rates during the Neptune orbit traverse. To this end, we take a realistic distribution of transneptunian objects to launch a sufficient number of dust grains of different sizes and follow their orbits by including radiation pressure, Poynting-Robertson and stellar wind drag, as well as the perturbations of four giant planets. In a subsequent statistical analysis, we calculate number densities and lifetimes of the dust grains in order to simulate a collisional cascade. In contrast to the previous work, our model not only considers collisional elimination of particles, but also includes production of finer debris. We find that particles captured in the 3:2 resonance with Neptune build clumps that are not removed by collisions, because the depleting effect of collisions is counteracted by production of smaller fragments. Our model successfully reproduces the dust impact rates measured by New Horizons out to ~23AU and predicts an increase of the impact rate of about a factor of two or three around the Neptune orbit crossing. This result is robust with respect to the variation of the vaguely known number of dust-producing scattered disk objects, collisional outcomes, and the dust properties. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.4245;The ballistic transport instability in Saturn's rings II: nonlinear wave  dynamics; Henrik Latter,  Gordon Ogilvie,  Marie Chupeau;  The ejecta discharged by impacting meteorites can redistribute a planetary ring's mass and angular momentum. This `ballistic transport' of ring properties instigates a linear instability that could generate the 100--1000-km undulations observed in Saturn's inner B-ring and in its C-ring. We present semi-analytic results demonstrating how the instability sustains steadily travelling nonlinear wavetrains. At low optical depths, the instability produces approximately sinusoidal waves of low amplitude, which we identify with those observed between radii 77,000 and 86,000 km in the C-ring. On the other hand, optical depths of 1 or more exhibit hysteresis, whereby the ring falls into multiple stable states: the homogeneous background equilibrium or large-amplitude wave states. Possibly the `flat zones' and `wave zones' between radii 93,000 and 98,000 km in the B-ring correspond to the stable homogeneous and wave states, respectively. In addition, we test the linear stability of the wavetrains and show that only a small subset are stable. In particular, stable solutions all possess wavelengths greater than the lengthscale of fastest linear growth. We supplement our calculations with a weakly nonlinear analysis that suggests the C-ring reproduces some of the dynamics of the complex Ginzburg--Landau equation. In the third paper in the series, these results will be tested and extended with numerical simulations. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.4247;The ballistic transport instability in Saturn's rings III: numerical  simulations; Henrik Latter,  Gordon Ogilvie,  Marie Chupeau;  Saturn's inner B-ring and its C-ring support wavetrains of contrasting amplitudes but with similar length scales, 100-1000 km. In addition, the inner B-ring is punctuated by two intriguing `flat' regions between radii 93,000 km and 98,000 km in which the waves die out, whereas the C-ring waves coexist with a forest of plateaus, narrow ringlets, and gaps. In both regions the waves are probably generated by a large-scale linear instability whose origin lies in the meteoritic bombardment of the rings: the ballistic transport instability. In this paper, the third in a series, we numerically simulate the long-term nonlinear evolution of this instability in a convenient local model. Our C-ring simulations confirm that the unstable system forms low-amplitude wavetrains possessing a preferred band of wavelengths. B-ring simulations, on the other hand, exhibit localised nonlinear wave `packets' separated by linearly stable flat zones. Wave packets travel slowly while spreading in time, a result that suggests the observed flat regions in Saturn's B-ring are shrinking. Finally, we present exploratory runs of the inner B-ring edge which reproduce earlier numerical results: ballistic transport can maintain the sharpness of a spreading edge while building a `ramp' structure at its base. Moreover, the ballistic transport instability can afflict the ramp region, but only in low-viscosity runs. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.4365;Stars Get Dizzy After Lunch; Michael Zhang,  Kaloyan Penev;  Exoplanet searches have discovered a large number of 'hot Jupiters'--high-mass planets orbiting very close to their parent stars in nearly circular orbits. A number of these planets are sufficiently massive and close-in to be significantly affected by tidal dissipation in the parent star, to a degree parametrized by the tidal quality factor $Q_*$. This process speeds up their stars' rotation rate while reducing the planets' semimajor axis. In this paper, we investigate the tidal destruction of hot Jupiters. Because the orbital angular momenta of these planets are a significant fraction of their stars' rotational angular momenta, they spin up their stars significantly while spiralling to their deaths. Using Monte Carlo simulation, we predict that for $Q_* = 10^6$, $3.9\times 10^{-6}$ of stars with the Kepler Target Catalog's mass distribution should have a rotation period shorter than 1/3 day (8 h) due to accreting a planet. Exoplanet surveys such as SuperWASP, HATnet, HATsouth, and KELT have already produced light curves of millions of stars. These two facts suggest that it may be possible to search for tidally-destroyed planets by looking for stars with extremely short rotational periods, then looking for remnant planet cores around those candidates, anomalies in the metal distribution, or other signatures of the recent accretion of the planet. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Quintana,  Thomas Barclay;  The Kepler-186 system consists of five planets orbiting an early-M dwarf. The planets have physical radii of 1.0-1.50 R$_\oplus$ and orbital periods of 4 to 130 days. The $1.1~$R$_\oplus$ Kepler-186f with a period of 130 days is of particular interest. Its insolation of roughly $0.32~S_\odot$places it within the liquid water habitable zone. We present a multi-faceted study of the Kepler-186 system. First, we show that the distribution of planet masses can be roughly reproduced if the planets accreted from a high-surface density disk presumably sculpted by an earlier phase of migration. However, our simulations predict the existence of 1-2 undetected planets between planets e and f. Next, we present a dynamical analysis of the system including the effect of tides. The timescale for tidal evolution is short enough that the four inner planets must have small obliquities and near-synchronous rotation rates. Tidal evolution of Kepler-186f is slow enough that its current spin state depends on a combination of its dissipation rate and the stellar age. Finally, we study the habitability of Kepler-186f with a 1-D climate model. The planet's surface temperature can be raised above 273 K with 0.5-5 bars of CO$_2$, depending on the amount of N$_2$ present. Kepler-186f represents a case study of an Earth-sized planet in the cooler regions of the habitable zone of a cool star. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Additionally, the system including proposed planet g by Vogt et al.

We present revised reduced chi-squared values for Keplerian astrocentric orbital fits assuming 4-planet and 5-planet models for GJ~581 under the condition that best fits must be stable, and find no distinguishable difference by including planet g in the model.

Fernandes,  Lee J. Grenfell,  Heike Rauer,  Roland Wagner,  Stephanie C. Werner;"  Understanding the concept of habitability is related to an evolutionary knowledge of the particular planet-in-question. Additional indications so-called ""systemic aspects"" of the planetary system as a whole governs a particular planet's claim on habitability. Here we focus on such systemic aspects and discuss their relevance to the formation of an 'Earth-like' habitable planet. We summarize our results obtained by lunar sample work and numerical models within the framework of the Research Alliance ""Planetary Evolution and Life"". We consider various scenarios which simulate the dynamical evolution of the Solar System and discuss the likelihood of forming an Earth-like world orbiting another star. Our model approach is constrained by observations of the modern Solar System and the knowledge of its history. Results suggest that the long-term presence of terrestrial planets is jeopardized due to gravitational interactions if giant planets are present. But habitability of inner rocky planets may be supported in those planetary systems hosting giant planets. Gravitational interactions within a complex multiple-body structure including giant planets may supply terrestrial planets with materials which formed in the colder region of the proto-planetary disk. During these processes, water, the prime requisite for habitability, is delivered to the inner system. This may occur either during the main accretion phase of terrestrial planets or via impacts during a post-accretion bombardment. Results for both processes are summarized and discussed with reference to the lunar crater record. Starting from a scenario involving migration of the giant planets this contribution discusses the delivery of water to Earth, the modification of atmospheres by impacts in a planetary system context and the likelihood of the existence of extrasolar Earth-like habitable worlds.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.4493;The Effect of Planetary Illumination on Climate Modelling of Earthlike  Exomoons; Duncan Forgan,  Vergil Yotov;  From analytical studies of tidal heating, eclipses and planetary illumination, it is clear that the exomoon habitable zone (EHZ) - the set of moon and host planet orbits that permit liquid water on an Earthlike moon's surface - is a manifold of higher dimension than the planetary HZ. This paper outlines the first attempt to produce climate models of exomoons which possess all the above sources and sinks of energy. We expand on our previous 1D latitudinal energy balance models (LEBMs), which follow the evolution of the temperature on an Earthlike moon orbiting a Jupiterlike planet, by adding planetary illumination. We investigate the EHZ in four dimensions, running two separate suites of simulations. The first investigates the EHZ by varying the planet's orbit, keeping the moon's orbit fixed, to compare the EHZ with planetary habitable zones. In general, planetary illumination pushes EHZs slightly further away from the star. Secondly, we fix the planet's orbit and vary the moon's orbit, to investigate the circumplanetary inner habitable edge. We demonstrate that an outer edge can exist due to eclipses (rather than merely orbital stability), but this edge may be pushed outwards when the effect of the carbonate-silicate cycle is taken into account. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Chodas,  Pasquale Tricarico,  Michael S. P. Kelley,  Tony L. Farnham;  Comet C/2013 A1 (siding Spring) will experience a high velocity encounter with Mars on October 19, 2014 at a distance of 135,000 km +- 5000 km from the planet center. We present a comprehensive analysis of the trajectory of both the comet nucleus and the dust tail. The nucleus of C/2013 A1 cannot impact on Mars even in the case of unexpectedly large nongravitational perturbations. Furthermore, we compute the required ejection velocities for the dust grains of the tail to reach Mars as a function of particle radius and density and heliocentric distance of the ejection. A comparison between our results and the most current modeling of the ejection velocities suggests that impacts are possible only for millimeter to centimeter size particles released more than 13 au from the Sun. However, this level of cometary activity that far from the Sun is considered extremely unlikely. The arrival time of these particles spans a 20-minute time interval centered at October 19, 2014 at 20:09 TDB, i.e., around the time that Mars crosses the orbital plane of C/2013 A1. Ejection velocities larger than currently estimated by a factor >2 would allow impacts for smaller particles ejected as close as 3 au from the Sun. These particles would reach Mars from 43 to 130 min after the nominal close approach epoch of the purely gravitational trajectory of the nucleus. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Poncy;  Remote sensing observations meet some limitations when used to study the bulk atmospheric composition of the giant planets of our solar system. A remarkable example of the superiority of in situ probe measurements is illustrated by the exploration of Jupiter, where key measurements such as the determination of the noble gases abundances and the precise measurement of the helium mixing ratio have only been made available through in situ measurements by the Galileo probe. This paper describes the main scientific goals to be addressed by the future in situ exploration of Saturn placing the Galileo probe exploration of Jupiter in a broader context and before the future probe exploration of the more remote ice giants. In situ exploration of Saturn's atmosphere addresses two broad themes that are discussed throughout this paper: first, the formation history of our solar system and second, the processes at play in planetary atmospheres. In this context, we detail the reasons why measurements of Saturn's bulk elemental and isotopic composition would place important constraints on the volatile reservoirs in the protosolar nebula. We also show that the in situ measurement of CO (or any other disequilibrium species that is depleted by reaction with water) in Saturn's upper troposphere would constrain its bulk O/H ratio. We highlight the key measurements required to distinguish competing theories to shed light on giant planet formation as a common process in planetary systems with potential applications to most extrasolar systems. In situ measurements of Saturn's stratospheric and tropospheric dynamics, chemistry and cloud-forming processes will provide access to phenomena unreachable to remote sensing studies. Different mission architectures are envisaged, which would benefit from strong international collaborations. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.4861;Resonance breaking due to dissipation in planar planetary systems; J.-B. Delisle,  J. Laskar,  A.C.M. Correia;  We study the evolution of two planets around a star, in mean-motion resonance and undergoing tidal effect. We derive an integrable analytical model of mean-motion resonances of any order which reproduce the main features of the resonant dynamics. Using this simplified model, we obtain a criterion showing that depending on the balance of the tidal dissipation in both planets, their final period ratio may stay at the resonant value, increase above, or decrease below the resonant value. Applying this criterion to the two inner planets orbiting GJ163, we deduce that the current period ratio (2.97) could be the outcome of dissipation in the 3:1 MMR provided that the innermost planet is gaseous (slow dissipation) while the second one is rocky (faster dissipation). We perform N-body simulations with tidal dissipation to confirm the results of our analytical model. We also apply our criterion on GJ581b, c (5:2 MMR) and reproduce the current period ratio (2.4) if the inner planet is gaseous and the outer is rocky (as for GJ163). Finally, we apply our model to the Kepler mission's statistics. We show that the excess of planets pairs close to first order MMR but in external circulation, i.e., with period ratios P_out/P_in > (p+1)/p for the resonance (p+1):p, can be reproduced by tidal dissipation in the inner planet. There is no need for any other dissipative mechanism, provided that these systems left the resonance with non-negligible eccentricities. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Waelkens;  We aimed to measure the H2O and dust production rates in C/2006 W3 (Christensen) with the Herschel Space Observatory at a heliocentric distance of ~ 5 AU. We have searched for emission in the H2O and NH3 ground-state rotational transitions at 557 GHz and 572 GHz, simultaneously, with HIFI onboard Herschel on UT 1.5 September 2010. Photometric observations of the dust coma in the 70 and 160 {\mu}m channels were acquired with the PACS instrument on UT 26.5 August 2010. A tentative 4-{\sigma} H2O line emission feature was found in the spectra obtained with the HIFI wide-band and high-resolution spectrometers, from which we derive a water production rate of $2.0(5) \times 10^{27}$ molec. s$^{-1}$. A 3-{\sigma} upper limit for the ammonia production rate of <$1.5 \times 10^{27}$ molec. s$^{-1}$ is obtained taking into account the contribution from all hyperfine components. The blueshift of the water line detected by HIFI suggests preferential emission from the subsolar point. However, it is also possible that water sublimation occurs in small ice-bearing grains that are emitted from an active region on the nucleus surface at a speed of ~ 0.2 km s$^{-1}$. The dust thermal emission was detected in the 70 and 160 {\mu}m filters, with a more extended emission in the blue channel. The dust production rates, obtained for a dust size distribution index that explains the fluxes at the photocenters of the PACS images, lie in the range 70-110 kg s$^{-1}$. Scaling the CO production rate measured post-perihelion at 3.20 and 3.32 AU, these values correspond to a dust-to-gas production rate ratio in the range 0.3-0.4. The dust production rates derived in August 2010 are roughly one order of magnitude lower than in September 2009, suggesting that the dust-to-gas production rate ratio remained approximately constant during the period when the activity became increasingly dominated by CO outgassing. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.4990;N-body Simulations of Terrestrial Planet Formation under the Influence  of a Hot Jupiter; Masahiro Ogihara,  Hiroshi Kobayashi,  Shu-ichiro Inutsuka;"  We investigate the formation of multiple-planet systems in the presence of a hot Jupiter using extended N-body simulations that are performed simultaneously with semi-analytic calculations. Our primary aims are to describe the planet formation process starting from planetesimals using high-resolution simulations, and to examine the dependences of the architecture of planetary systems on input parameters (e.g., disk mass, disk viscosity). We observe that protoplanets that arise from oligarchic growth and undergo type I migration stop migrating when they join a chain of resonant planets outside the orbit of a hot Jupiter. The formation of a resonant chain is almost independent of our model parameters, and is thus a robust process. At the end of our simulations, several terrestrial planets remain at around 0.1 AU. The formed planets are not equal-mass; the largest planet constitutes more than 50 percent of the total mass in the close-in region, which is also less dependent on parameters. In the previous work of this paper (Ogihara et al. 2013), we have found a new physical mechanism of induced migration of the hot Jupiter, which is called a crowding-out. If the hot Jupiter opens up a wide gap in the disk (e.g., owing to low disk viscosity), crowding-out becomes less efficient and the hot Jupiter remains. We also discuss angular momentum transfer between the planets and disk. ";Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.4992;Strong Dependence of the Inner Edge of the Habitable Zone on Planetary  Rotation Rate; Jun Yang,  Gwenael Boue,  Daniel C. Fabrycky,  Dorian S. Abbot;  Planetary rotation rate is a key parameter in determining atmospheric circulation and hence the spatial pattern of clouds. Since clouds can exert a dominant control on planetary radiation balance, rotation rate could be critical for determining mean planetary climate. Here we investigate this idea using a three-dimensional general circulation model with a sophisticated cloud scheme. We find that slowly rotating planets (like Venus) can maintain an Earth-like climate at nearly twice the stellar flux as rapidly rotating planets (like Earth). This suggests that many exoplanets previously believed to be too hot may actually be habitable, depending on their rotation rate. The explanation for this behavior is that slowly rotating planets have a weak Coriolis force and long daytime illumination, which promotes strong convergence and convection in the substellar region. This produces a large area of optically thick clouds, which greatly increases the planetary albedo. In contrast, on rapidly rotating planets a much narrower belt of clouds form in the deep tropics, leading to a relatively low albedo. A particularly striking example of the importance of rotation rate suggested by our simulations is that a planet with modern Earth's atmosphere, in Venus' orbit, and with modern Venus' (slow) rotation rate would be habitable. This would imply that if Venus went through a runaway greenhouse, it had a higher rotation rate at that time. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5018;The Formation of Uranus & Neptune: Challenges and Implications For  Intermediate-Mass Exoplanets; Ravit Helled,  Peter Bodenheimer;  In this paper we investigate the formation of Uranus and Neptune, according to the core-nucleated accretion model, considering formation locations ranging from 12 to 30 AU from the Sun, and with various disk solid-surface densities and core accretion rates. It is shown that in order to form Uranus-like and Neptune-like planets in terms of final mass and solid-to-gas ratio, very specific conditions are required. We also show that when recently proposed high solid accretion rates are assumed, along with solid surface densities about 10 times those in the minimum-mass solar nebula, the challenge in forming Uranus and Neptune at large radial distances is no longer the formation timescale, but is rather finding agreement with the final mass and composition of these planets. In fact, these conditions are more likely to lead to gas-giant planets. Scattering of planetesimals by the forming planetary core is found to be an important effect at the larger distances. Our study emphasizes how (even slightly) different conditions in the protoplanetary disk and the birth environment of the planetary embryos can lead to the formation of very different planets in terms of final masses and compositions (solid-to-gas ratios), which naturally explains the large diversity of intermediate-mass exoplanets. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5266;Constraints on the height of the inner disk rim in pre-main-sequence  stars; Dejan VinkoviÄ;  The structure of inner region of protoplanetary disks around young pre-main-sequence stars is still poorly understood. This part of the disk is shaped by various forces that influence dust and gas dynamics, and by dust sublimation, which creates abrupt drops in the dust density. This region also emits strong near-infrared excess that cannot be explained by classical accretion disk models, which suggests the existence of some unusual dust distribution or disk shape. The most prevalent explanation to date is the puffed-up inner disk rim model, where the disk exhibits an optically thin cavity around the star up to the distance of dust sublimation. The critical parameter in this model is the inner disk rim height $z_{\rm max}$ relative to the rim distance from the star $R_{\rm in}$. Observations often require $z_{\rm max}/R_{\rm in}\gtrsim0.2$ to reproduce the near-infrared excess in the spectra. We compile a comprehensive list of processes that can shape the inner disk rim and combine them into a self-consistent model. Two of them, radiation pressure force and the gas velocity profile, have never been applied in this context before. The aim was to find the most plausible theoretical values of $z_{\rm max}/R_{\rm in}$. The results show that this value is $\lesssim$0.13 for Herbig Ae stars, $\lesssim$0.11 for T Tau stars, and $\lesssim$0.10 for young brown dwarfs. This is lower than the observational requirements for Herbig Ae stars. We argue that the same problem exists in T Tau stars as well. We conclude that the puffed-up inner rim model cannot be the sole explanation for the near-infrared excess in young pre-main-sequence stars. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Kasting,  Shawn Domagal-Goldman,  Vincent Eymet;  The ongoing discoveries of extrasolar planets are unveiling a wide range of terrestrial mass (size) planets around their host stars. In this letter, we present estimates of habitable zones (HZs) around stars with stellar effective temperatures in the range 2600 K - 7200 K, for planetary masses between 0.1 ME and 5 ME. Assuming H2O (inner HZ) and CO2 (outer HZ) dominated atmospheres, and scaling the background N2 atmospheric pressure with the radius of the planet, our results indicate that larger planets have wider HZs than do smaller ones. Specifically, with the assumption that smaller planets will have less dense atmospheres, the inner edge of the HZ (runaway greenhouse limit) moves outward (~10% lower than Earth flux) for low mass planets due to larger greenhouse effect arising from the increased H2O column depth. For larger planets, the H2O column depth is smaller, and higher temperatures are needed before water vapor completely dominates the outgoing longwave radiation. Hence the inner edge moves inward (7% higher than Earth's flux). The outer HZ changes little due to the competing effects of the greenhouse effect and an increase in albedo. New, 3-D climate model results from other groups are also summarized, and we argue that further, independent studies are needed to verify their predictions. Combined with our previous work, the results presented here provide refined estimates of HZs around main-sequence stars and provide a step towards a more comprehensive analysis of HZs. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5337;Prospects for Detecting Oxygen, Water, and Chlorophyll on an Exo-Earth; Timothy D. Brandt,  David S. Spiegel;"  The goal of finding and characterizing nearby Earth-like planets is driving many NASA high-contrast flagship mission concepts, the latest of which is known as the Advanced Technology Large-Aperture Space Telescope (ATLAST). In this article, we calculate the optimal spectral resolution $R=\lambda/\delta\lambda$ and minimum signal-to-noise ratio per spectral bin (SNR), two central design requirements for a high-contrast space mission, in order to detect signatures of water, oxygen, and chlorophyll on an Earth twin. We first develop a minimally parametric model and demonstrate its ability to fit synthetic and observed Earth spectra; this allows us to measure the statistical evidence for each component's presence. We find that water is the easiest to detect, requiring a resolution $R \gtrsim 20$, while the optimal resolution for oxygen is likely to be closer to $R = 150$, somewhat higher than the canonical value in the literature. At these resolutions, detecting oxygen will require $\sim$2 times the SNR as water. Chlorophyll requires $\sim$6 times the SNR as oxygen for an Earth twin, only falling to oxygen-like levels of detectability for a low cloud cover and/or a large vegetation covering fraction. This suggests designing a mission for sensitivity to oxygen and adopting a multi-tiered observing strategy, first targeting water, then oxygen on the more favorable planets, and finally chlorophyll on only the most promising worlds.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5360;Planets Transiting Non-Eclipsing Binaries; David V. Martin,  Amaury H.M.J. Triaud;  The majority of binary stars do not eclipse. Current searches for transiting circumbinary planets concentrate on eclipsing binaries, and are therefore restricted to a small fraction of potential hosts. We investigate the concept of finding planets transiting non-eclipsing binaries, whose geometry would require mutually inclined planes. Using an N-body code we explore how the number and sequence of transits vary as functions of observing time and orbital parameters. The concept is then generalised thanks to a suite of simulated circumbinary systems. Binaries are constructed from RV surveys of the solar neighbourhood. They are then populated with orbiting gas giants, drawn from a range of distributions. The binary population is shown to be compatible with the Kepler eclipsing binary catalogue, indicating that the properties of binaries may be as universal as the initial mass function. These synthetic systems produce transiting circumbinary planets occurring on both eclipsing and non-eclipsing binaries. Simulated planets transiting eclipsing binaries are compared with published Kepler detections. We obtain 1) that planets transiting non-eclipsing binaries probably exist in the Kepler data, 2) that observational biases alone cannot account for the observed over-density of circumbinary planets near the stability limit, implying a physical pile-up, and 3) that the distributions of gas giants orbiting single and binary stars are likely different. Estimating the frequency of circumbinary planets is degenerate with the spread in mutual inclination. Only a minimum occurrence rate can be produced, which we find to be compatible with 9%. Searching for inclined circumbinary planets may significantly increase the population of known objects and will test our conclusions. Their existence, or absence, will reveal the true occurrence rate and help develop circumbinary planet formation theories. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5377;Radial Velocities of Stars with Multiple Co-orbital Planets; Anthony R. Dobrovolskis;"  To date, well over a thousand planets have been discovered orbiting other stars, hundreds of them in multi-planet systems. Most of these exoplanets have been detected by either the transit method or the radial velocity method, rather than by other methods such as astrometry or direct imaging. Both the radial velocity and astrometric methods rely upon the reflex motion of the parent star induced by the gravitational attraction of its planets. However, this reflex motion is subject to misinterpretation when a star has two or more planets with the same orbital period. Such co-orbital planets may effectively ""hide"" from detection by current algorithms. In principle, any number of planets can share the same orbit; the case where they all have the same mass has been studied most. Salo and Yoder (A & A 205, 309--327, 1988) have shown that more than 8 planets of equal mass sharing a circular orbit must be equally spaced for dynamical stability, while fewer than 7 equal-mass planets are stable only in a configuration where all of the planets remain on the same side of their parent star. For 7 or 8 equal-mass planets, both configurations are stable. By symmetry, it is clear that the equally-spaced systems produce no reflex motion or radial velocity signal at all in their parent stars. This could lead to their being overlooked entirely, unless they happen to be detected by the transit method. It is equally clear that the lopsided systems produce a greater radial velocity signal than a single such planet would, but a smaller signal than if all of the planets were combined into one. This could seriously mislead estimates of exoplanet masses and densities. Transit data and ellipsoidal (tidal) brightness variations in such systems also are subject to misinterpretation. This behavior is also representative of more natural systems, with co-orbital planets of different masses. ";Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5462;Planet Traps and First Planets: the Critical Metallicity for Gas Giant  Formation; Yasuhiro Hasegawa,  Hiroyuki Hirashita;  The ubiquity of planets poses an interesting question: when first planets are formed in galaxies. We investigate this problem by adopting a theoretical model developed for understanding the statistical properties of exoplanets. Our model is constructed as the combination of planet traps with the standard core accretion scenario in which the efficiency of forming planetary cores directly relates to the dust density in disks or the metallicity ([Fe/H]). We statistically compute planet formation frequencies (PFFs) as well as the orbital radius ($<R_{rapid}>$) within which gas accretion becomes efficient enough to form Jovian planets. The three characteristic exoplanetary populations are considered: hot Jupiters, exo-Jupiters densely populated around 1 AU, and low-mass planets such as super-Earths. We explore the behavior of the PFFs as well as $<R_{rapid}>$ for the three different populations as a function of metallicity ($-2 \leq$[Fe/H]$\leq -0.6$). We show that the total PFFs increase steadily with metallicity, which is the direct outcome of the core accretion picture. For the entire range of the metallicity considered here, the population of the low-mass planets dominates over the Jovian planets. The Jovian planets contribute to the PFFs above [Fe/H]-1. We find that the hot Jupiters form at lower metallcities than the exo-Jupiters. This arises from the radially inward transport of planetary cores by their host traps, which is more effective for lower metallicity disks due to the slower growth of the cores. The PFFs for the exo-Jupiters exceed those for the hot Jupiters around [Fe/H]-0.7. Finally, we show that the critical metallicity for forming Jovian planets is [Fe/H]-1.2, which is evaluated by comparing the values of $<R_{rapid}>$ between the hot Jupiters and the low-mass planets. The comparison intrinsically links to the different gas accretion efficiency between them. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Udry;  We present here the first observationally based determination of the rate of occurrence of circumbinary planets. This is derived from the publicly available Kepler data, using an automated search algorithm and debiasing process to produce occurrence rates implied by the seven systems already known. These rates depend critically on the planetary inclination distribution: if circumbinary planets are preferentially coplanar with their host binaries, as has been suggested, then the rate of occurrence of planets with $R_p>6R_\oplus$ orbiting with $P_p<300$\ d is $10.0 ^{+18}_{-6.5}$\% (95\% confidence limits), higher than but consistent with single star rates. If on the other hand the underlying planetary inclination distribution is isotropic, then this occurrence rate rises dramatically, to give a lower limit of 47\%. This implies that formation and subsequent dynamical evolution in circumbinary disks must either lead to largely coplanar planets, or proceed with significantly greater ease than in circumstellar disks. As a result of this investigation we also show that giant planets (${>}10R_\oplus$) are significantly less common in circumbinary orbits than their smaller siblings, and confirm that the proposed shortfall of circumbinary planets orbiting the shorter period binaries in the Kepler sample is a real effect. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5627;Searching for circumplanetary disks around LkCa 15; Andrea Isella,  Claire J. Chandler,  John M. Carpenter,  Laura M. Pe'rez,  Luca Ricci;  We present Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations of the 7 mm continuum emission from the disk surrounding the young star LkCa 15. The observations achieve an angular resolution of 70 mas and spatially resolve the circumstellar emission on a spatial scale of 9 AU. The continuum emission traces a dusty annulus of 45 AU in radius that is consistent with the dust morphology observed at shorter wavelengths. The VLA observations also reveal a compact source at the center of the disk, possibly due to thermal emission from hot dust or ionized gas located within a few AU from the central star. No emission is observed between the star and the dusty ring, and, in particular, at the position of the candidate protoplanet LkCa 15 b. By comparing the observations with theoretical models for circumplanetary disk emission, we find that if LkCa~15~b is a massive planet (>5 M_J) accreting at a rate greater than 1.e-6 M_J yr^{-1}, then its circumplanetary disk is less massive than 0.1 M_J, or smaller than 0.4 Hill radii. Similar constraints are derived for any possible circumplanetary disk orbiting within 45 AU from the central star. The mass estimate are uncertain by at least one order of magnitude due to the uncertainties on the mass opacity. Future ALMA observations of this system might be able to detect circumplanetary disks down to a mass of 5.e-4 M_J and as small as 0.2 AU, providing crucial constraints on the presence of giant planets in the act of forming around this young star. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Masiero;  Comet 17P/Holmes underwent a massive outburst in 2007 Oct., brightening by a factor of almost a million in under 48 hours. We used infrared images taken by the Wide-Field Survey Explorer mission to characterize the comet as it appeared at a heliocentric distance of 5.1 AU almost 3 years after the outburst. The comet appeared to be active with a coma and dust trail along the orbital plane. We constrained the diameter, albedo, and beaming parameter of the nucleus to 4.135 $\pm$ 0.610 km, 0.03 $\pm$ 0.01 and 1.03 $\pm$ 0.21, respectively. The properties of the nucleus are consistent with those of other Jupiter Family comets. The best-fit temperature of the coma was 134 $\pm$ 11 K, slightly higher than the blackbody temperature at that heliocentric distance. Using Finson-Probstein modeling we found that the morphology of the trail was consistent with ejection during the 2007 outburst and was made up of dust grains between 250 $\mu$m and a few cm in radius. The trail mass was $\sim$ 1.2 - 5.3 $\times$ 10$^{10}$ kg. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5712;Spectroscopic Coronagraphy for Planetary Radial Velocimetry of  Exoplanets; Hajime Kawahara,  Naoshi Murakami,  Taro Matsuo,  Takayuki Kotani;"  We propose the application of coronagraphic techniques to the spectroscopic direct detection of exoplanets via the Doppler shift of planetary molecular lines. Even for an unresolved close-in planetary system, we show that the combination of a visible nuller and an extreme adaptive optics system can reduce the photon noise of a main star and increase the total signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the molecular absorption of the exoplanetary atmosphere: it works as a spectroscopic coronagraph. Assuming a 30 m telescope, we demonstrate the benefit of these high-contrast instruments for nearby close-in planets that mimic 55 Cnc b ($0.6 \lambda/D$ of the angular separation in the K band). We find that the tip-tilt error is the most crucial factor; however, low-order speckles also contribute to the noise. Assuming relatively conservative estimates for future wavefront control techniques, the spectroscopic coronagraph can increase the contrast to $ \sim 50-130 $ times and enable us to obtain $\sim 3-6 $ times larger S/N for warm Jupiters and Neptunes at 10 pc those without it. If the tip-tilt error can be reduced to $\lesssim 0.3$ mas (rms), it gains $\sim 10-30$ times larger S/N and enables us to detect warm super-Earths with an extremely large telescope. This paper demonstrates the concept of spectroscopic coronagraphy for future spectroscopic direct detection. Further studies of the selection of coronagraphs and tip-tilt sensors will extend the range of application of the spectroscopic direct detection beyond the photon collecting area limit.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5817;Magnetohydrodynamic Simulations of Hot Jupiter Upper Atmospheres; George B. Trammell,  Zhi-Yun Li,  Phil Arras;  Two-dimensional simulations of hot Jupiter upper atmospheres including the planet's magnetic field are presented. The goal is to explore magnetic effects on the layer of the atmosphere that is ionized and heated by stellar EUV radiation, and the imprint of these effects on the Ly$\alpha$ transmission spectrum. The simulations are axisymmetric, isothermal, and include both rotation and azimuth-averaged stellar tides. Mass density is converted to atomic hydrogen density through the assumption of ionization equilibrium. The three-zone structure -- polar dead zone, mid-latitude wind zone, and equatorial dead zone -- found in previous analytic calculations is confirmed. For a magnetic field comparable to that of Jupiter, the equatorial dead zone, which is confined by the magnetic field and corotates with the planet, contributes at least half of the transit signal. For even stronger fields, the gas escaping in the mid-latitude wind zone is found to have a smaller contribution to the transit depth than the equatorial dead zone. Transmission spectra computed from the simulations are compared to HST STIS and ACS data for HD 209458b and HD 189733b, and the range of model parameters consistent with the data is found. The central result of this paper is that the transit depth increases strongly with magnetic field strength when the hydrogen ionization layer is magnetically dominated, for dipole magnetic field $B_0 > 10\ {\rm G}$. Hence transit depth is sensitive to magnetic field strength, in addition to standard quantities such as the ratio of thermal to gravitational binding energies. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

MÃ¼ller,  S. Hasegawa,  F. Usui;  The near-Earth asteroid (25143) Itokawa was characterised in great detail by the Japanese Hayabusa mission. We revisited the available thermal observations in the light of the true asteroid properties with the goal to evaluate the possibilities and limitations of thermal model techniques. In total, we used 25 published ground-based mid-infrared photometric observations and 5 so far unpublished measurements from the Japanese infrared astronomical satellite AKARI in combination with improved H-G values. Our thermophysical model (TPM) approach allowed us to determine correctly the sense of rotation, to estimate the thermal inertia and to derive robust effective size and albedo values by only using a simple spherical shape model. A more complex shape model, derived from light-curve inversion techniques, improved the quality of the predictions considerably and made the interpretation of thermal light-curve possible. The radiometrically derived effective diameter value agrees within 2% of the true Itokawa size value. The combination of our TPM and the final Itokawa in-situ shape model was then used as a benchmark for deriving and testing radiometric solutions. The consolidated value for the surface-averaged thermal inertia is 700 $\pm$ 200 Jm$^{-2}$s$^{-0.5}$K$^{-1}$. We found that even the high resolution shape models still require additional small-scale roughness in order to explain the disk-integrated infrared measurements. Our description of the thermal effects as a function of wavelengths, phase angle, and rotational phase facilitates the planning of crucial thermal observations for sophisticated characterization of small bodies, including other potentially hazardous asteroids. Our analysis shows the power of radiometric techniques to derive the size, albedo, thermal inertia, and also spin-axis orientation from small sets of measurements at thermal infrared wavelengths. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Altieri;  The near-Earth asteroid (99942) Apophis is a potentially hazardous asteroid. We obtained far-infrared observations of this asteroid with the Herschel Space Observatory's PACS instrument at 70, 100, and 160 micron. These were taken at two epochs in January and March 2013 during a close Earth encounter. These first thermal measurements of Apophis were taken at similar phase angles before and after opposition. We performed a detailed thermophysical model analysis by using the spin and shape model recently derived from applying a 2-period Fourier series method to a large sample of well-calibrated photometric observations. We find that the tumbling asteroid Apophis has an elongated shape with a mean diameter of 375$^{+14}_{-10}$ m (of an equal volume sphere) and a geometric V-band albedo of 0.30$^{+0.05}_{-0.06}$. We find a thermal inertia in the range 250-800 Jm$^{-2}$s$^{-0.5}$K$^{-1}$ (best solution at 600 Jm$^{-2}$s$^{-0.5}$K$^{-1}$), which can be explained by a mixture of low conductivity fine regolith with larger rocks and boulders of high thermal inertia on the surface. The thermal inertia, and other similarities with (25143) Itokawa indicate that Apophis might also have a rubble-pile structure. If we combine the new size value with the assumption of an Itokawa-like density and porosity we estimate a mass between 4.4 and 6.2 10$^{10}$ kg which is more than 2-3 times larger than previous estimates. We expect that the newly derived properties will influence impact scenario studies and influence the long-term orbit predictions of Apophis. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Its activity along the orbit's inbound leg evolved through a series of cycles. Two remarkable events preserved in SOHO's and/or STEREO's near-perihelion images of its tail were an early massive production of gravel at heliocentric distances of up to ~100 AU, evidently by the annealing of amorphous water ice on and near the nucleus' surface; and, about a week before perihelion, a rapid series of powerful explosions, from the comet's interior, of water with dust at extremely high rates, causing precipitous fragmentation of the nucleus, shattering it into a vast number of sublimating boulders, and ending up, a few days later, with a major, sudden drop in gas emission. The disintegration of the comet was completed by about 3.5 hours before perihelion, at a heliocentric distance of 5.2 Rsun, when C/2012 S1 ceased to exist as an active comet. The orbital motion in this period of time was subjected to progressively increasing outgassing-driven perturbations. A comprehensive orbital analysis results in successfully fitting the comet's observed motion from 2011 to ~7 hours before perihelion. ";Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Connections between parameters of precipitating fast ions and resulting escape fluxes, altitude-dependent energy distributions of fast atoms and their coefficients of reflection from the Mars atmosphere, are established using accurate cross sections in Monte Carlo simulations.

Udry;  The search for planets orbiting metal-poor stars is of uttermost importance for our understanding of the planet formation models. However, no dedicated searches have been conducted so far for very low mass planets orbiting such objects. Only a few cases of low mass planets orbiting metal-poor stars are thus known. Amongst these, HD41248 is a metal-poor, solar-type star on which a resonant pair of super-Earth like planets has In the present paper we present a new planet search program that is using the HARPS spectrograph to search for Neptunes and Super-Earths orbiting a sample of metal-poor FGK dwarfs. We then present a detailed analysis of an additional 162 radial velocity measurements of HD41248, obtained within this program, with the goal of confirming the existence of the proposed planetary system. We analyzed the precise radial velocities, obtained with the HARPS spectrograph, together with several stellar activity diagnostics and line profile indicators. A careful analysis shows no evidence for the planetary system previously announced. One of the signals, with a period of about 25 days, is shown to be related to the rotational period of the star, and is clearly seen in some of the activity proxies. The remaining signal (P~18 days) could not be convincingly retrieved in the new data set. We discuss possible causes for the complex (evolving) signals observed in the data of HD41248, proposing that they may be explained by the appearance and disappearance of active regions on the surface of a star with strong differential rotation, or by a combination of the sparse data sampling and active region evolution. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Eiroa;  We present an analysis of the debris disc around the nearby K2 V star HIP 17439. In the context of the Herschel DUNES key programme the disc was observed and spatially resolved in the far-IR with the Herschel PACS and SPIRE instruments. In a first model, Ertel et al. (2014) assumed the size and radial distribution of the circumstellar dust to be independent power laws. There, by exploring a very broad range of possible model parameters several scenarios capable of explaining the observations were suggested. In this paper, we perform a follow-up in-depth collisional modelling of these scenarios trying to further distinguish between them. In our models we consider collisions, direct radiation pressure, and drag forces, i.e. the actual physical processes operating in debris discs. We find that all scenarios discussed in Ertel et al. are physically sensible and can reproduce the observed SED along with the PACS surface brightness profiles reasonably well. In one model, the dust is produced beyond 120au in a narrow planetesimal belt and is transported inwards by Poynting-Robertson and stellar wind drag. A good agreement with the observed radial profiles would require stellar winds by about an order of magnitude stronger than the solar value, which is not supported, although not ruled out, by observations. Another model consists of two spatially separated planetesimal belts, a warm inner and a cold outer one. This scenario would probably imply the presence of planets clearing the gap between the two components. Finally, we show qualitatively that the observations can be explained by assuming the dust is produced in a single, but broad planetesimal disc with a surface density of solids rising outwards, as expected for an extended disc that experiences a natural inside-out collisional depletion. Prospects of discriminating between the competing scenarios by future observations are discussed. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

A routine monitoring program at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center has recorded over 300 impacts since 2006. A selection of 126 flashes recorded during periods of photometric skies was analyzed, creating the largest and most homogeneous dataset of lunar impact flashes to date. Standard CCD photometric techniques were applied to the video and the luminous energy, kinetic energy, and mass are estimated for each impactor. Shower associations were determined for most of the impactors and a range of luminous efficiencies was considered. The flux to a limiting energy of 2.5E-6 kT TNT or 1.05E7 J is 1.03E-7 km-2 hr-1 and the flux to a limiting mass of 30 g is 6.14E-10 m-2 yr-1 at the Moon. Comparisons made with measurements and models of the meteoroid population indicate that the flux of objects in this size range is slightly lower (but within error bars) than flux at this size from the near Earth object and fireball population by Brown et al. 2002.

Our images clearly show for the first time the position of the star relative to its circumstellar ring thanks to NICI's translucent focal plane occulting mask. We employ a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to constrain the offset vector between the two. The resulting probability distribution shows that the ring center is offset from the star by 16.7+/-1.3 milliarcseconds along a position angle of 26+/-3 degrees, along the PA of the ring, 26.47+/-0.04 degrees. We find that the size of this offset is not large enough to explain the brightness asymmetry of the ring. The ring is measured to have mostly red reflectivity across the JHK_s filters, which seems to indicate micron-sized grains. Just like Neptune's 3:2 and 2:1 mean-motion resonances delineate the inner and outer edges of the classical Kuiper Belt, we find that the radial extent of the HR 4796 A and Fomalhaut rings could correspond to the 3:2 and 2:1 mean-motion resonances of hypothetical planets at 54.7 AU and 97.7 AU in the two systems, respectively. A planet orbiting HR 4796 A at 54.7 AU would have to be less massive than 1.6 Mjup so as not to widen the ring too much by stirring. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

We consider a scenario where the exoplanet hosts a moon that has its own atmosphere and neither of the atmospheres is in chemical disequilibrium. Our results show that the integrated spectrum of the planet and the moon closely resembles that of a single object in strong chemical disequilibrium. We derive a firm limit on the maximum spectral resolution that can be obtained for both directly-imaged and transiting planets. The spectral resolution of even idealized space-based spectrographs that might be achievable in the next several decades is in general insufficient to break the degeneracy. Both chemical species can only be definitively confirmed in the same object if absorption features of both chemicals can be unambiguously identified and their combined depth exceeds 100%. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)"

Van Kooten,  Richard Greenberg;"  The Flora family resides in the densely populated inner main belt, bounded in semimajor axis by the $\nu_6$ secular resonance and the Jupiter 3:1 mean motion resonance. The presence of several large families that overlap dynamically with the Floras (e.g., the Vesta, Baptistina, and Nysa-Polana families), and the removal of a significant fraction of Floras via the nearby $\nu_6$ resonance complicates the Flora family's distinction in both proper orbital elements and reflectance properties. Here we use orbital information from the Asteroids Dynamic Site, color information from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and albedo information from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer to obtain the median orbital and reflectance properties of the Floras by sampling the core of the family in multidimensional phase space. We find the median Flora SDSS colors to be $a^*$ = 0.126 $\pm$ 0.007 and $i-z = -0.037 \pm 0.007$; the median Flora albedo is $p_V$ = 0.291 $\pm$ 0.012. These properties allow us to define ranges for the Flora family in orbital and reflectance properties, as required for a detailed dynamical study. We use the young Karin family, for which we have an age determined via direct backward integration of members' orbits, to calibrate the Yarkovsky drift rates for the Flora family without having to estimate the Floras' material properties. The size-dependent dispersion of the Flora members in semimajor axis (the ""V"" plot) then yields an age for the family of $910^{+160}_{-120}$ My, with the uncertainty dominated by the uncertainty in the material properties of the family members (e.g., density and surface thermal properties). We discuss the effects on our age estimate of two independent processes that both introduce obliquity variations among the family members on short (My) timescales: 1) the capture of Flora members in spin-orbit resonance, and 2) YORP-driven obliquity variation.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.6940;The compressional beta effect: a source of zonal winds in planets?; Jan Verhoeven,  Stephan Stellmach;  Giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn feature strong zonal wind patterns on their surfaces. Although several different mechanisms that may drive these jets have been proposed over the last decades, the origin of the zonal winds is still unclear. Here, we explore the possibility that the interplay of planetary rotation with the compression and expansion of the convecting fluid can drive multiple deep zonal jets by a compressional Rhines-type mechanism, as originally proposed by Ingersoll and Pollard (1982). In a certain limit, this deep mechanism is shown to be mathematically analogous to the classical Rhines mechanism possibly operating at cloud level. Jets are predicted to occur on a compressional Rhines length $l_R = (2 \Omega \langle H_\rho^{-1} \rangle v_{jet}^{-1} )^{-1/2}$, where $\Omega$ is the angular velocity, $\langle H_\rho^{-1} \rangle$ is the mean inverse density scale height and $v_{jet}$ is the typical jet velocity. Two-dimensional numerical simulations using the anelastic approximation reveal that this mechanism robustly generates jets of the predicted width, and that it typically dominates the dynamics in systems deeper than $O(l_R)$. Potential vorticity staircases are observed to form spontaneously and are typically accompanied by unstably stratified buoyancy staircases. The mechanism only operates at large rotation rates, exceeding those typically reached in three-dimensional simulations of deep convection in spherical shells. Applied to Jupiter and Saturn, the compressional Rhines scaling reasonably fits the available observations. Interestingly, even weak vertical density variations such as those in the Earth core can give rise to a large number of jets, leading to fundamentally different flow structures than predicted by the Boussinesq models typically used in this context. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn); Geophysics (physics.geo-ph)"

Rice;  We study particle dynamics in self-gravitating gaseous discs with a simple cooling law prescription via two-dimensional simulations in the shearing sheet approximation. It is well known that structures arising in the gaseous component of the disc due to a gravitational instability can have a significant effect on the evolution of dust particles. Previous results have shown that spiral density waves can be highly efficient at collecting dust particles, creating significant local over-densities of particles. The degree of such concentrations has been shown to be dependent on two parameters: the size of the dust particles and the rate of gas cooling. We expand on these findings, including the self-gravity of dust particles, to see how these particle over-densities evolve. We use the PENCIL CODE to solve the local shearing sheet equations for gas on a fixed grid together with the equations of motion for solids coupled to the gas through an aerodynamic drag force. We find that the enhancements in the surface density of particles in spiral density wave crests can reach levels high enough to allow the solid component of the disc to collapse under its own self-gravity. This produces many gravitationally bound collections of particles within the spiral structure. The total mass contained in bound structures appears nearly independent of the cooling time, suggesting that the formation of planetesimals through dust particle trapping by self-gravitating density waves may be possible at a larger range of radii within a disc than previously thought. So, density waves due to gravitational instabilities in the early stages of star formation may provide excellent sites for the rapid formation of many large, planetesimal-sized objects. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Taking the hot Jupiter HD 189733b as a fiducial example, we analytically solve a set of linear equations subject to stationary stellar heating with a uniform zonal-mean flow included. We also extract wave information in the final equilibrium state of the atmosphere from the radiative hydrodynamical simulation for HD 189733b by Dobbs-Dixon & Agol (2013). We find that the analytic wave solutions are able to qualitatively explain the three-dimensional simulation results. Studying the vertical structure of waves allows us to explore new wave features such as the westward tilt of wavefronts related to the Rossby-wave resonance as well as double gyres of dispersive Rossby waves. We also make an attempt to apply our linear wave analysis to explain some numerical features associated with the equatorial jet development seen in the GCM by Showman & Polvani (2011). During the spin-up phase of the equatorial jet, the acceleration of the jet as a result of the divergence of the wave momentum flux can be in principle boosted by the Rossby-wave resonance as the superrotating jet speed is close to the phase speed of the Rossby waves. However, we also find that as the jet speed increases, the Rossby-wave structure shifts eastward, while the Kelvin-wave structure remains approximately stationary, leading to the decline of the acceleration rate. Our analytic model of jet evolution implies that there exists only one stable equilibrium state of the atmosphere, possibly implying that the final state of the atmosphere is independent of initial conditions in the linear regime. Limitations and future improvements are also discussed. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0026;Analytical Models of Exoplanetary Atmospheres. II. Radiative Transfer  via the Two-stream Approximation; Kevin Heng,  JoÃ£o M. MendonÃ§a,  Jae-Min Lee;  We present a comprehensive analytical study of radiative transfer using the method of moments and include the effects of non-isotropic scattering in the coherent limit. Within this unified formalism, we derive the governing equations and solutions describing two-stream radiative transfer (which approximates the passage of radiation as a pair of outgoing and incoming fluxes), flux-limited diffusion (which describes radiative transfer in the deep interior) and solutions for the temperature-pressure profiles. Generally, the problem is mathematically under-determined unless a set of closures (Eddington coefficients) is specified. We demonstrate that the hemispheric (or hemi-isotropic) closure naturally derives from the radiative transfer equation if energy conservation is obeyed, while the Eddington closure produces spurious enhancements of both reflected light and thermal emission. We concoct recipes for implementing two-stream radiative transfer in stand-alone numerical calculations and general circulation models. We use our two-stream solutions to construct toy models of the runaway greenhouse effect. We present a new solution for temperature-pressure profiles with a non-constant optical opacity and elucidate the effects of non-isotropic scattering in the optical and infrared. We derive generalized expressions for the spherical and Bond albedos and the photon deposition depth. We demonstrate that the value of the optical depth corresponding to the photosphere is not always 2/3 (Milne's solution) and depends on a combination of stellar irradiation, internal heat and the properties of scattering both in optical and infrared. Finally, we derive generalized expressions for the total, net, outgoing and incoming fluxes in the convective regime. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics (physics.ao-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0280;Steady-state planet migration by the Kozai-Lidov mechanism in stellar  binaries; Cristobal Petrovich;"  We study the steady-state orbital distributions of giant planets migrating through the combination of the Kozai-Lidov (KL) mechanism due to a stellar companion and friction due to tides raised on the planet by the host star. We run a large set of Monte Carlo simulations that describe the secular evolution of a star-planet-star triple system including the effects from general relativistic precession, stellar and planetary spin evolution, and tides. Our simulations show that KL migration produces Hot Jupiters (HJs) with semi-major axes that are generally smaller than in the observations and they can only explain the observations if the following are both true: (i) tidal dissipation at high eccentricities is at least $\sim 150$ times more efficient than the upper limit inferred from the Jupiter-Io interaction; (ii) highly eccentric planets get tidally disrupted at distances $\gtrsim 0.015$ AU. Based on the occurrence rate and semi-major axis distribution of HJs, we find that KL migration in stellar binaries can produce at most $\sim 20\%$ of the observed HJs. Almost no intermediate-period (semi-major axis $\sim0.1-2$ AU) planets are formed by this mechanism - migrating planets spend most of their lifetimes undergoing KL oscillations at large orbital separations ($>2$ AU) or as Hot Jupiters.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0375;Photochemistry of atomic oxygen green and red-doublet emissions in  comets at larger heliocentric distances; Susarla Raghuram,  Anil Bhardwaj;  In comets the atomic oxygen green to red-doublet emission intensity ratio (G/R ratio) of 0.1 has been used to confirm H$_2$O as the parent species producing oxygen emission lines. The larger ($>$0.1) value of G/R ratio observed in a few comets is ascribed to the presence of higher CO$_2$ and CO relative abundances in the cometary coma. We aim to study the effect of CO$_2$ and CO relative abundances on the observed G/R ratio in comets observed at large ($>$2 au) heliocentric distances by accounting for important production and loss processes of O($^1$S) and O($^1$D) in the cometary coma. Recently we have developed a coupled chemistry-emission model to study photochemistry of O($^1$S) and O($^1$D) atoms and the production of green and red-doublet emissions in comets Hyakutake and Hale-Bopp. In the present work we applied the model to six comets where green and red-doublet emissions are observed when they are beyond 2 au from the Sun. In a water-dominated cometary coma and with significant ($>$10%) CO$_2$ relative abundance, photodissociation of H$_2$O mainly governs the red-doublet emission, whereas CO$_2$ controls the green line emission. If a comet has equal composition of CO$_2$ and H$_2$O, then ~50% of red-doublet emission intensity is controlled by the photodissociation of CO$_2$. The G/R ratio values and green and red-doublet line widths calculated by the model are consistent with the observation. Our model calculations suggest that in low gas production rate comets the G/R ratio greater than 0.1 can be used to constrain the upper limit of CO$_2$ relative abundance provided the slit-projected area on the coma is larger than the collisional zone. If a comet has equal abundances of CO$_2$ and H$_2$O, then the red-doublet emission is significantly ($\sim$50%) controlled by CO$_2$ photodissociation and thus the G/R ratio is not suitable for estimating CO$_2$ relative abundance. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0381;Three body resonances in close orbiting planetary systems: Tidal  dissipation and orbital evolution; John C. B. Papaloizou;  We study the orbital evolution of a three planet system with masses in the super-Earth regime resulting from the action of tides on the planets induced by the central star which cause orbital circularization. We consider systems either in or near to a three body commensurability for which adjacent pairs of planets are in a first order commensurability. We develop a simple analytic solution, derived from a time averaged set of equations, that describes the expansion of the system away from strict commensurability as a function of time, once a state where relevant resonant angles undergo small amplitude librations has been attained. We perform numerical simulations that show the attainment of such resonant states focusing on the Kepler 60 system. The results of the simulations confirm many of the scalings predicted by the appropriate analytic solution. We go on to indicate how the results can be applied to put constraints on the amount of tidal dissipation that has occurred in the system. For example, if the system has been in a librating state since its formation, we find that its present period ratios imply an upper limit on the time average of 1/Q', with Q' being the tidal dissipation parameter. On the other hand if a librating state has not been attained, a lower upper bound applies. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Here, we study the Kozai-Lidov mechanism systematically in the test particle limit at the octupole level of approximation. We investigate the chaotic and quasiperiodic orbital evolution by studying surfaces of section and the Lyapunov exponents. We find that the resonances introduced by the octupole level of approximation cause orbits to flip from prograde to retrograde and back as well as cause significant eccentricity excitation, and the chaotic behaviors occur when the mutual inclination between the inner and the outer binary is high. We characterize the parameter space that allows large amplitude oscillations in eccentricity and inclination. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0840;Interstellar Simulations Using A Unified Microscopic-Macroscopic Monte  Carlo Model with a full Gas-Grain Network including Bulk Diffusion in Ice  Mantles; Qiang Chang,  Eric herbst;  We have designed an improved algorithm that enables us to simulate the chemistry of cold dense interstellar clouds with a full gas-grain reaction network. The chemistry is treated by a unified microscopic-macroscopic Monte Carlo approach that includes photon penetration and bulk diffusion. To determine the significance of these two processes, we simulate the chemistry with three different models. In Model 1, we use an exponential treatment to follow how photons penetrate and photodissociate ice species throughout the grain mantle. Moreover, the products of photodissociation are allowed to diffuse via bulk diffusion and react within the ice mantle. Model 2 is similar to Model 1 but with a slower bulk diffusion rate. A reference Model 0, which only allows photodissociation reactions to occur on the top two layers, is also simulated. Photodesorption is assumed to occur from the top two layers in all three models. We found that the abundances of major stable species in grain mantles do not differ much among these three models, and the results of our simulation for the abundances of these species agree well with observations. Likewise, the abundances of gas-phase species in the three models do not vary. However, the abundances of radicals in grain mantles can differ by up to two orders of magnitude depending upon the degree of photon penetration and the bulk diffusion of photodissociation products. We also found that complex molecules can be formed at temperatures as low as 10 K in all three models. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)"

Stassun (1,2),  Joshua Pepper (3,1),  ((1) Vanderbilt University, (2) Fisk University, (3) Lehigh University);"  Most extrasolar planets have been detected by their influence on their parent star, typically either gravitationally (the Doppler method) or by the small dip in brightness as the planet blocks a portion of the star (the transit method). Therefore, the accuracy with which we know the masses and radii of extrasolar planets depends directly on how well we know those of the stars, the latter usually determined from the measured stellar surface gravity, logg. Recent work has demonstrated that the short-timescale brightness variations (""flicker"") of stars can be used to measure logg to a high accuracy of ~0.1-0.2 dex (Bastien et al. 2013). Here, we use flicker measurements of 289 bright (Kepmag<13) candidate planet-hosting stars with Teff=4500-6650 K to re-assess the stellar parameters and determine the resulting impact on derived planet properties. This re-assessment reveals that for the brightest planet-host stars, an astrophysical bias exists that contaminates the stellar sample with evolved stars: nearly 50% of the bright planet-host stars are subgiants. As a result, the stellar radii, and hence the radii of the planets orbiting these stars, are on average 20-30% larger than previous measurements had suggested.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0960;Spin-Orbit angle distribution and the origin of (mis)aligned hot  Jupiters; AurÃ©lien Crida,  Konstantin Batygin;  For 61 transiting hot Jupiters, the projection of the angle between the orbital plane and the stellar equator (called the spin-orbit angle) has been measured. For about half of them, a significant misalignment is detected, and retrograde planets have been observed. This challenges scenarios of the formation of hot Jupiters. In order to better constrain formation models, we relate the distribution of the real spin-orbit angle $\Psi$ to the projected one $\beta$. Then, a comparison with the observations is relevant. We analyse the geometry of the problem to link analytically the projected angle $\beta$ to the real spin-orbit angle $\Psi$. The distribution of $\Psi$ expected in various models is taken from the literature, or derived with a simplified model and Monte-Carlo simulations in the case of the disk-torquing mechanism. An easy formula to compute the probability density function (PDF) of $\beta$ knowing the PDF of $\Psi$ is provided. All models tested here look compatible with the observed distribution beyond 40 degrees, which is so far poorly constrained by only 18 observations. But only the disk-torquing mechanism can account for the excess of aligned hot Jupiters, provided that the torquing is not always efficient. This is the case if the exciting binaries have semi-major axes as large as 10000 AU. Based on comparison with the set of observations available today, scattering models and the Kozai cycle with tidal friction models can not be solely responsible for the production of all hot Jupiters. Conversely, the presently observed distribution of the spin-orbit angles is compatible with most hot Jupiters having been transported by smooth migration inside a proto-planetary disk, itself possibly torqued by a companion. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

This is the first model to fully account for the evolution of the angular momentum of the stellar convective envelope by the tidal coupling, the transfer of angular momentum between the stellar convective and radiative zones, the effects of the stellar evolution on the tidal dissipation efficiency and stellar core and envelope spins, the loss of stellar convective zone angular momentum to a magnetically launched wind and frequency dependent tidal dissipation. This is only a first release and further development is under way to allow calculating the evolution of inclined and eccentric orbits, with the latter including the tidal dissipation in the planet and its feedback on planetary structure. Considerable effort has been devoted to providing extensive documentation detailing both the usage and the complete implementation details, in order to make it as easy as possible for independent groups to use and/or extend the code for their purposes. POET represents a significant improvement over some previous models for planetary tidal evolution and so has many astrophysical applications. In this article, we describe and illustrate several key examples. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Santos,  StÃ©phane Udry,  Damien SÃ©gransan;  The atmospheric composition of low-mass exoplanets is the object of intense observational and theoretical investigations. GJ3470b is a warm uranus recently detected in transit across a bright late-type star. The transit of this planet has already been observed in several band passes from the ground and space, allowing observers to draw an intriguing yet incomplete transmission spectrum of the planet atmospheric limb. In particular, published data in the visible suggest the existence of a Rayleigh scattering slope, making GJ3470b a unique case among the known neptunes, while data obtained beyond 2 um are consistent with a flat infrared spectrum. The unexplored near-infrared spectral region between 1 and 2 um, is thus key to undertanding the atmospheric nature of GJ3470b. Here, we report on the first space-borne spectrum of GJ3470, obtained during one transit of the planet with WFC3 on board HST, operated in stare mode. The spectrum covers the 1.1--1.7-um region with a resolution of about 300. We retrieve the transmission spectrum of GJ3470b with a chromatic planet-to-star radius ratio precision of 0.15% (about one scale height) per 40-nm bins. At this precision, the spectrum appears featureless, in good agreement with ground-based and Spitzer infrared data at longer wavelengths, pointing to a flat transmission spectrum from 1 to 5 um. We present new simulations of transmission spectra for GJ3470b, which allow us to show that the HST/WFC3 observations rule out cloudless hydrogen-rich atmospheres (>10 sigma) as well as hydrogen-rich atmospheres with tholin haze (>5 sigma). Adding our near-infrared measurements to the full set of previously published data from 0.3 to 5 um, we find that a cloudy, hydrogen-rich atmosphere can explain the full transmission spectrum if, at the terminator, the clouds are located at low pressures (<1 mbar) or the water mixing ratio is extremely low (<1 ppm). ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)"

GutiÃ©rrez;  We analyze a sample of 139 near-Earth asteroids (NEAs), defined as those that reach perihelion distances $q < 1.3$ au, and that also fulfill the conditions of approaching or crossing Jupiter's orbit (aphelion distances $Q > 4.8$ au), having Tisserand parameters $2 < T < 3$ and orbital periods $P < 20$ yr. In order to compare the dynamics, we also analyze a sample of 42 Jupiter family comets (JFCs) in near-Earth orbits, i.e. with $q < 1.3$ au. We integrated the orbits of these two samples for $10^4$ yr in the past and in the future. We find that the great majority of the NEAs move on stable orbits during the considered period, and that a large proportion of them are in one of the main mean motion resonances with Jupiter, in particular the 2:1. We find a strong coupling between the perihelion distance and the inclination in the motion of most NEAs, due to Kozai mechanism, that generates many sungrazers. On the other hand, most JFCs are found to move on very unstable orbits, showing large variations in their perihelion distances in the last few $10^2 - 10^3$ yr, which suggests a rather recent capture in their current near-Earth orbits. Even though most NEAs of our sample move in typical 'asteroidal' orbits, we detect a small group of NEAs whose orbits are highly unstable, resembling those of the JFCs. These are: 1997 SE5, 2000 DN1, 2001 XQ, 2002 GJ8, 2002 RN38, 2003 CC11, 2003 WY25, 2009 CR2, and 2011 OL51. These objects might be inactive comets, and indeed 2003 WY25 has been associated with comet Blanpain, and it is now designed as comet 289P/Blanpain. Under the assumption that these objects are inactive comets, we can set an upper limit of $\sim 0.17$ to the fraction of NEAs with $Q > 4.8$ au of cometary origin, but it could be even lower if the NEAs in unstable orbits listed before turn out to be {\it bona fide} asteroids from the main belt. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Zaidi;  Young, nearby stars are ideal targets to search for planets using the direct imaging technique. The determination of stellar parameters is crucial for the interpretation of imaging survey results particularly since the luminosity of substellar objects has a strong dependence on system age. We have conducted a large program with NaCo at the VLT in order to search for planets and brown dwarfs in wide orbits around 86 stars. A large fraction of the targets observed with NaCo were poorly investigated in the literature. We performed a study to characterize the fundamental properties (age, distance, mass) of the stars in our sample. To improve target age determinations, we compiled and analyzed a complete set of age diagnostics. We measured spectroscopic parameters and age diagnostics using dedicated observations acquired with FEROS and CORALIE spectrographs at La Silla Observatory. We also made extensive use of archival spectroscopic data and results available in the literature. Additionally, we exploited photometric time-series, available in ASAS and Super-WASP archives, to derive rotation period for a large fraction of our program stars. We provided updated characterization of all the targets observed in the VLT NaCo Large program, a survey designed to probe the occurrence of exoplanets and brown dwarfs in wide orbits. The median distance and age of our program stars are 64 pc and 100 Myr, respectively. Nearly all the stars have masses between 0.70 and 1.50sun, with a median value of 1.01 Msun. The typical metallicity is close to solar, with a dispersion that is smaller than that of samples usually observed in radial velocity surveys. Several stars are confirmed or proposed here to be members of nearby young moving groups.

We used NaCo at VLT to explore the occurrence rate of giant planets and brown dwarfs between typically 0.1 and 8''. Diffraction-limited observations in H-band combined with angular differential imaging enabled us to reach primary star-companion brightness ratios as small as 10-6 at 1.5''. 12 systems were resolved as new binaries, including the discovery of a new white dwarf companion to the star HD8049. Around 34 stars, at least one companion candidate was detected in the observed field of view. More than 400 faint sources were detected, 90% of them in 4 crowded fields. With the exception of HD8049B, we did not identify any new comoving companions. The survey also led to spatially resolved images of the thin debris disk around HD\,61005 that have been published earlier. Finally, considering the survey detection limits, we derive a preliminary upper limit on the frequency of giant planets for semi-major axes of [10,2000] AU: typically less than 15% between 100 and 500 AU, and less than 10% between 50 and 500 AU for exoplanets more massive than 5 MJup and 10 MJup respectively, considering a uniform input distribution and with a confidence level of 95%. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

The study samples include unmelted, partially melted (scoriaceous) and completely melted (cosmic spherules) micrometeorites. This variety not only allows comparison of the mineralogy and porosity of these three micrometeorite types, but also reveals changes in meteoroid properties during atmospheric entry at various velocities. At low entry velocities, meteoroids do not melt, and their physical properties do not change. The porosity of unmelted micrometeorites varies considerably (0-12%) with one friable example having porosity around 50%. At higher velocities, the range of meteoroid porosity narrows, but average porosity increases (to 16-27%) due to volatile evaporation and partial melting (scoriaceous phase). Metal distribution seems to be mostly unaffected at this stage. At even higher entry velocities, complete melting follows the scoriaceous phase. Complete melting is accompanied by metal oxidation and redistribution, loss of porosity (1 $\pm$ 1%), and narrowing of the bulk (3.2 $\pm$ 0.5 g/cm$^{3}$) and grain (3.3 $\pm$ 0.5 g/cm$^{3}$) density range.

The large surface area of Jupiter allows us to probe cosmic rays of higher energies than previously accessible. Cosmic ray extensive air showers in Jupiter's atmosphere could in principle be detected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on the Fermi observatory. In order to be observed, these air showers would need to be oriented toward the Earth, and would need to occur sufficiently high in the atmosphere that the gamma rays can penetrate. We demonstrate that, under these assumptions, Jupiter provides an effective cosmic ray ""detector"" area of $3.3 \times 10^7$ km$^2$. We predict that Fermi-LAT should be able to detect events of energy $>10^{21}$ eV with fluence $10^{-7}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ at a rate of about one per month. The observed number of air showers may provide an indirect measure of the flux of cosmic rays $\gtrsim 10^{20}$ eV. Extensive air showers also produce a synchrotron signature that may be measurable by ALMA. Simultaneous observations of Jupiter with ALMA and Fermi-LAT could be used to provide broad constraints on the energies of the initiating cosmic rays.

Marzari;  The dynamics of systems of two and three planets, initially placed on circular and nearly coplanar orbits, is explored in the proximity of their stability limit. The evolution of a large number of systems is numerically computed and their dynamical behaviour is investigated with the frequency map analysis as chaos indicator. Following the guidance of this analysis, it is found that for two-planet systems the dependence of the Hill limit on the planet mass, usually made explicit through the Hill's radius parametrization, does not appear to be fully adequate. In addition, frequent cases of stable chaos are found in the proximity of the Hill limit. For three-planet systems, the usual approach adopted in numerical explorations of their stability, where the planets are initially separated by multiples of the mutual Hill radius, appears too reducing. A detailed sampling of the parameter space reveals that systems with more packed inner planets are stable well within previous estimates of the stability limit. This suggests that a two-dimensional approach is needed to outline when three-planet systems are dynamically stable. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1735;On the tidal origin of hot Jupiter stellar obliquity trends; Rebekah Dawson;  It is debated whether the two hot Jupiter populations --- those on orbits misaligned from their host star's spin axis and those well-aligned --- result from two migration channels or from two tidal realignment regimes. Here I demonstrate that equilibrium tides raised by a planet on its star can account for three observed spin-orbit alignment trends: the aligned orbits of hot Jupiters orbiting cool stars, the planetary mass cut-off for retrograde planets, and the stratification by planet mass of cool host stars' rotation frequencies. The first trend can be caused by strong versus weak magnetic braking (the Kraft break), rather than realignment of the star's convective envelope versus the entire star. The second trend can result from a small effective stellar moment of inertia participating in the tidal realignment in hot stars, enabling massive retrograde planets to partially realign to become prograde. The third trend is attributable to higher mass planets more effectively counteracting braking to spin up their stars. Both hot and cool star require a small effective stellar moment of inertia participating in the tidal realignment, e.g., an outer layer weakly coupled to the interior. I demonstrate via Monte Carlo that this model can match the observed trends and distributions of sky-projected misalignments and stellar rotation frequencies. I discuss implications for inferring hot Jupiter migration mechanisms from obliquities, emphasizing that even hot stars do not constitute a pristine sample. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1769;New meteor showers identified in the CAMS and SonotaCo meteoroid orbit  surveys; Regina Rudawska,  Peter Jenniskens;  A cluster analysis was applied to the combined meteoroid orbit database derived from low-light level video observations by the SonotaCo consortium in Japan (64,650 meteors observed between 2007 and 2009) and by the Cameras for All-sky Meteor Surveillance (CAMS) project in California, during its first year of operation (40,744 meteors from Oct. 21, 2010 to Dec. 31, 2011). The objective was to identify known and potentially new meteoroid streams and identify their parent bodies. The database was examined by a single-linking algorithm using the Southworth and Hawkins D-criterion to identify similar orbits, with a low criterion threshold of D < 0.05. A minimum member threshold of 6 produced a total of 88 meteoroid streams. 43 are established streams and 45 are newly identified streams. The newly identified streams were included as numbers 448-502 in the IAU Meteor Shower Working List. Potential parent bodies are proposed. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

The first results of the database analysis, in which we studied minor streams, are presented. Using the radiant-geocentric velocity method we identified 267 meteor showers, among them 67 established showers and 200 from the working list of the IAU MDC. Making a more detailed examination, we clearly identified 22 showers of 65 pro tempore showers of the working list of the IAU MDC (updated in August 2013). The identification of 18 meteor showers was questionable, while 25 showers were not found. For all the identified temporary meteor showers, we list the weighted mean orbital elements, the radiant position and the geocentric velocity. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM)"

This has a profound effect on their structure and, as a result, density measurements that assume that the planet is spherical can be incorrect. We have simulated the tidally distorted surface for 34 known short period hot-Jupiters, assuming surfaces of constant gravitational equipotential for the planet, and the resulting densities have been calculated based only on observed parameters of the exoplanet systems. Comparing these results to the density values assuming the planets are spherical shows that there is an appreciable change in the measured density for planets with very short periods (typically less than two days). For one of the shortest-period systems, WASP-19b, we determine a decrease in bulk density of 12% from the spherical case and, for the majority of systems in this study, this value is in the range of 1-5%. On the other-hand, we also find cases where the distortion is negligible (relative to the measurement errors on the planetary parameters) even in the cases of some very short period systems, depending on the mass ratio and planetary radius. For high-density gas-planets requiring apparently anomalously large core masses, density corrections due to tidal deformation could become important for the shortest-period systems. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1880;Orbital Perturbations of the Galilean Satellites During Planetary  Encounters; R. Deienno,  D. Nesvorny,  D. Vokrouhlicky,  T. Yokoyama;  The Nice model of the dynamical instability and migration of the giant planets can explain many properties of the present Solar System, and can be used to constrain its early architecture. In the jumping-Jupiter version of the Nice model, required from the terrestrial planet constraint and dynamical structure of the asteroid belt, Jupiter has encounters with an ice giant. Here we study the survival of the Galilean satellites in the jumping-Jupiter model. This is an important concern because the ice-giant encounters, if deep enough, could dynamically perturb the orbits of the Galilean satellites, and lead to implausible results. We performed numerical integrations where we tracked the effect of planetary encounters on the Galilean moons. We considered three instability cases from Nesvorny & Morbidelli (2012) that differed in the number and distribution of encounters. We found that in one case, where the number of close encounters was relatively small, the Galilean satellite orbits were not significantly affected. In the other two, the orbital eccentricities of all moons were excited by encounters, Callisto's semimajor axis changed, and, in a large fraction of trials, the Laplace resonance of the inner three moons was disrupted. The subsequent evolution by tides damps eccentricities and can recapture the moons in the Laplace resonance. A more important constraint is represented by the orbital inclinations of the moons, which can be excited during the encounters and not appreciably damped by tides. We find that one instability case taken from Nesvorny & Morbidelli (2012) clearly fails this constraint. This shows how the regular satellites of Jupiter can be used to set limits on the properties of encounters in the jumping-Jupiter model, and help us to better understand how the early Solar System evolved. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1986;Diversity of planetary systems in low-mass disks: Terrestrial-type  planet formation and water delivery; MarÃ­a Paula Ronco,  Gonzalo C. de ElÃ­a;  Several studies, observational and theoretical, suggest that planetary systems with only rocky planets should be the most common in the Universe. We study the diversity of planetary systems that might form around Sun-like stars in low-mass disks without giant planets. We focus on the formation process of terrestrial planets in the habitable zone (HZ) and analyze their water contents with the goal to determine systems of astrobiological interest. Besides, we study the formation of planets on wide orbits because they can be detected with the microlensing technique. N-body simulations of high resolution (embryos + planetesimals) are developed for a wide range of surface density profiles. The surface density profile combines a power law to the inside of the disk of the form r^{-gamma}, with an exponential decay to the outside. We adopt a disk of 0.03M_sun and values of gamma = 0.5, 1 and 1.5. All our simulations form planets in the HZ with different masses and final water contents depending on the 3 profiles. For gamma = 0.5, we produce 3 planets in the HZ with masses between 0.03 M_e to 0.1 M_e and water contents between 0.2 and 16 Earth oceans. For gamma = 1, 3 planets form in the HZ with masses between 0.18 M_e and 0.52 M_e and water contents from 34 to 167 Earth oceans. For gamma = 1.5, we find 4 planets in the HZ with masses from 0.66 M_e to 2.21 M_e and water contents between 192 and 2326 Earth oceans. This profile shows distinctive results because it is the only one of those studied here that leads to the formation of water worlds. Since planetary systems with gamma = 1 and 1.5 present planets in the HZ with suitable masses to retain a long-live atmosphere and to maintain plate tectonics, they seem to be the most outstanding candidates to be potentially habitable. Particularly, these systems form Earths and Super-Earths near the snow line which can be discovered by microlensing. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

A. Jones;  Variations related to stellar activity and correlated noise can prevent the detections of low-amplitude signals in radial velocity data if not accounted for. This can be seen as the greatest obstacle in detecting Earth-like planets orbiting nearby stars with Doppler spectroscopy regardless of developments in instrumentation and rapidly accumulating amounts of data. We use a statistical model that is not sensitive to aperiodic and/or quasiperiodic variability of stellar origin. We demonstrate the performance of our model by re-analysing the radial velocities of the moderately active star CoRoT-7 ($\log R_{\rm HK} = -4.61$) with a transiting planet whose Doppler signal has proven rather difficult to detect. We find that the signal of the transiting planet can be robustly detected together with signals of two other planet candidates. Our results suggest that rotation periods of moderately active stars can be filtered out of the radial velocity noise, which enables the detections of low-mass planets orbiting such stars. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)"

For KOI-319 and KOI-884, the observed Transit Timing Variations (TTVs) of the inner transiting planet are used to detect an outer non-transiting planet. The outer planet in KOI-884 is 2.6 Jupiter masses and has the orbital period just narrow of the 3:1 resonance with the inner planet (orbital period ratio 2.93). The distribution of parameters inferred from KOI-319.01's TTVs is bimodal with either a 1.6 Neptune-mass (M_N) planet wide of the 5:3 resonance (period 80.1 d) or a 1 Saturn-mass planet wide of the 7:3 resonance (period 109.2 d). The radial velocity measurements can be used in this case to determine which of these parameter modes is correct. KOI-227.01's TTVs with large 10 hour amplitude can be obtained for planetary-mass companions in various major resonances. Based on the Bayesian evidence, the current TTV data favor the outer 2:1 resonance with a companion mass 1.5 M_N, but this solution implies a very large density of KOI-227.01. The inner and outer 3:2 resonance solutions with sub-Neptune-mass companions are physically more plausible, but will need to be verified. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

The aim of our paper is to investigate the low-amplitude and long-period variations in evolved stars with a precise radial velocity (RV) survey. Methods. The high-resolution, the fiber-fed Bohyunsan Observatory Echelle Spectrograph (BOES) was used from 2003 to 2013 for a radial velocity survey of giant stars as part of the exoplanet search program at Bohyunsan Optical Astronomy Observatory (BOAO). Results. We report the detection of three new planetary companions orbiting the K giants beta Cnc, mu Leo, and beta UMi. The planetary nature of the radial velocity variations is supported by analyzes of ancillary data. The HIPPARCOS photometry shows no variations with periods close to those in RV variations and there is no strong correlation between the bisector velocity span (BVS) and the radial velocities for each star. Furthermore, the stars show weak or no core reversal in Ca II H lines indicating that they are inactive stars. The companion to beta Cnc has a minimum mass of 7.8 M_Jup in a 605-day orbit with an eccentricity of 0.08. The giant mu Leo is orbited by a companion of minimum mass of 2.4 M_Jup having a period of 357 days and an eccentricity of 0.09. The giant beta UMi is a known barium star and is suspected of harboring a white dwarf or substellar mass companion. Its companion has a minimum mass of 6.1 M_Jup, a period of 522 days, and an eccentricity e = 0.19. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.2259;Testing the Titius-Bode law predictions for Kepler multi-planet systems; Chelsea X. Huang,  GÃ¡spÃ¡r Ã. Bakos;  We use three and half years of Kepler Long Cadence data to search for the 97 predicted planets of Bovaird & Lineweaver (2013) in 56 of the multi-planet systems, based on a general Titius-Bode relation. Our search yields null results in the majority of systems. We detect five planetary candidates around their predicted periods. We also find an additional transit signal beyond those predicted in these systems. We discuss the possibility that the remaining predicted planets are not detected in the Kepler data due to their non-coplanarity or small sizes. We find that the detection rate is beyond the lower boundary of the expected number of detections, which indicates that the prediction power of the TB relation in general extra solar planetary systems is questionable. Our analysis of the distribution of the adjacent period ratios of the systems suggests that the general Titius-Bode relation may over-predict the presence of planet pairs near the 3:2 resonance. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.2342;Secular Effects of Tidal Damping in Compact Planetary Systems; Bradley M. S. Hansen,  Norman Murray;  We describe the long-term evolution of compact systems of terrestrial planets, using a set of simulations that match the statistical properties of the observed exoplanet distribution. The evolution is driven by tidal dissipation in the planetary interiors, but the systems evolve as a whole due to secular gravitational interactions. We find that, for Earth-like dissipation levels, planetary orbits can be circularised out to periods of order 100 days, an order of magnitude larger than is possible for single planets. The resulting distribution of eccentricities is a qualitative match to that inferred from transit timing variations, with a minority of non-zero eccentricities maintained by particular secular configurations. The coupling of the tidal and secular processes enhance the inward migration of the innermost planets in these systems, and can drive them to short orbital periods. Resonant interactions of both the mean motion and secular variety are observed, although the interactions are not strong enough to drive systemic instability in most cases. However, we demonstrate that these systems can easily be driven unstable if coupled to giant planets on longer period orbits. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Boccaletti,  J. H. Girard,  G. Chauvin;"  Very few debris discs have been imaged in scattered light at wavelengths beyond 3 microns because the thermal emission from both the sky and the telescope is generally too strong with respect to the faint emission of a debris disc. We present here the first analysis of a high angular resolution image of the disc of beta Pictoris at 3.8 microns. Our primary objective is to probe the innermost parts of the beta Pictoris debris disc and describe its morphology. We performed extensive forward modelling to correct for the biases induced by angular differential imaging on extended objects and derive the physical parameters of the disc. This work relies on a new analysis of seven archival datasets of beta Pictoris observed with VLT/NaCo in the Lp band, associated with disc forward modelling to correct for the biases induced by that technique. The disc is detected above a 5 sigma level between 0.4"" and 3.8"". The two extensions have a similar brightness within error bars. We confirm an asymmetry previously observed at larger distances from the star and at shorter wavelengths: the isophotes are more widely spaced on the north-west side (above the disc apparent midplane) than on the south-east side. This is interpreted as a small inclination of the disc combined with anisotropic scattering. Our best-fit model has an inclination of 86 degrees with an anisotropic Henyey- Greenstein coefficient of 0.36. This interpretation is supported by a new asymmetry detected in the disc: the disc is significantly bowed towards the north-west within 3"" (above the apparent midplane). We also detect a possible new asymmetry within 1"", but at this stage we cannot discern between a real feature and an underlying speckle.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.2650;Positions of equilibrium points for dust particles in the circular  restricted three-body problem with radiation; P. Pastor;  For a body with negligible mass moving in the gravitational field of a star and one planet in a circular orbit (the circular restricted three-body problem) five equilibrium points exist and are known as the Lagrangian points. The positions of the Lagrangian points are not valid for dust particles because in the derivation of the Lagrangian points is assumed that no other forces beside the gravitation act on the body with negligible mass. Here we determined positions of the equilibrium points for the dust particles in the circular restricted three-body problem with radiation. The equilibrium points are located on curves connecting the Lagrangian points in the circular restricted three-body problem. The equilibrium points for Jupiter are distributed in large interval of heliocentric distances due to its large mass. The equilibrium points for the Earth explain a cloud of dust particles trailing the Earth observed with the Spitzer Space Telescope. The dust particles moving in the equilibrium points are distributed in interplanetary space according to their properties. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.2778;Dust Transport in MRI Turbulent Disks: Ideal and Non-ideal MHD with  Ambipolar Diffusion; Zhaohuan Zhu,  James M. Stone,  Xue-Ning Bai;  We study dust transport in turbulent protoplanetary disks using three-dimensional global unstratified magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations including Lagrangian dust particles. The turbulence is driven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI) with either ideal or non-ideal MHD that includes ambipolar diffusion (AD). In ideal MHD simulations, the surface density evolution (except for dust that drifts fastest), turbulent diffusion, and vertical scale height of dust can all be reproduced by simple one-dimensoinal and/or analytical models. However, in AD dominated simulations which simulate protoplanetary disks beyond 10s of AU, the vertical scale height of dust is larger than previously predicted. To understand this anomaly in more detail, we carry out both unstratified and stratified local shearing box simulations with Lagrangian particles, and find that turbulence in AD dominated disks has very different properties (e.g., temporal autocorrelation functions and power spectra) than turbulence in ideal MHD disks, which leads to quite different particle diffusion efficiency. For example, MRI turbulence with AD has a longer correlation time for the vertical velocity, which causes significant vertical particle diffusion and large dust scale height. In ideal MHD the Schmidt numbers ($Sc$) for radial and vertical turbulent diffusion are $Sc_{r}\sim 1$ and $Sc_{z}\gtrsim 3$, but in the AD dominated regime both $Sc_{r}$ and $Sc_{z}$ are $\lesssim 1$. Particle concentration in pressure bumps induced by MRI turbulence has also been studied. Since non-ideal MHD effects dominate most regions in protoplanetary disks, our study suggests that modeling dust transport in turbulence driven by MRI with non-ideal MHD effects is important for understanding dust transport in realistic protoplanetary disks. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Paul Butler,  Russell Hanson,  Stefano Meschiari,  Eugenio J. Rivera,  Gregory W. Henry,  Gregory Laughlin;  Precision radial velocities from the Automated Planet Finder and Keck/HIRES reveal an M*sin(i) =18 +/- 2 Earth mass planet orbiting the nearby M3V star GJ 687. This planet has an orbital period, P = 38.14 days, and a low orbital eccentricity. Our Stromgren b and y photometry of the host star suggests a stellar rotation signature with a period of P = 60 days. The star is somewhat chromospherically active, with a spot filling factor estimated to be several percent. The rotationally{induced 60-day signal, however, is well-separated from the period of the radial velocity variations, instilling confidence in the interpretation of a Keplerian origin for the observed velocity variations. Although GJ 687b produces relatively little specific interest in connection with its individual properties, a compelling case can be argued that it is worthy of remark as an eminently typical, yet at a distance of 4.52 pc, a very nearby representative of the galactic planetary census. The detection of GJ 687b indicates that the APF telescope is well suited to the discovery of low-mass planets orbiting low-mass stars in the as-yet relatively un-surveyed region of the sky near the north celestial pole. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

The companion was first identified via its distinctively red i - z color (> 3.5) through a survey made with Gemini-S/GMOS. Follow-up Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope/WIRCam near-infrared (NIR) imaging, Gemini-N/GNIRS NIR spectroscopy and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer photometry indicate a spectral type of T3.5+-1 and reveal signs of low gravity which we attribute to youth. Keck/Adaptive Optics NIR observations did not resolve the companion as a binary. A comparison with atmosphere models indicates Teff = 1000-1100 K and logg = 4.5-5.0. Based on evolution models, this temperature corresponds to a mass of 9-13 MJup for the age of ABDMG (70-130 Myr). The relatively well-constrained age of this companion and its very large angular separation to its host star will allow its thorough characterization and will make it a valuable comparison for planetary-mass companions that will be uncovered by forthcoming planet-finder instruments such as Gemini Planet Imager and SPHERE.

We noticed that such high-albedo objects mostly consist of small (D < 3 km) bodies distributed in near-Earth space (with perihelion distance of q < 1.3 AU).

https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3120;High-resolution imaging of $Kepler$ planet host candidates. A  comprehensive comparison of different techniques; J. Lillo-Box,  D. Barrado,  H. Bouy;"  The Kepler mission has discovered thousands of planet candidates. Currently, some of them have already been discarded; more than 200 have been confirmed by follow-up observations, and several hundreds have been validated. However, most of them are still awaiting for confirmation. Thus, priorities (in terms of the probability of the candidate being a real planet) must be established for subsequent observations. The motivation of this work is to provide a set of isolated (good) host candidates to be further tested by other techniques. We identify close companions of the candidates that could have contaminated the light curve of the planet host. We used the AstraLux North instrument located at the 2.2 m telescope in the Calar Alto Observatory to obtain diffraction-limited images of 174 Kepler objects of interest. The lucky-imaging technique used in this work is compared to other AO and speckle imaging observations of Kepler planet host candidates. We define a new parameter, the blended source confidence level (BSC), to assess the probability of an object to have blended non-detected eclipsing binaries capable of producing the detected transit. We find that 67.2% of the observed Kepler hosts are isolated within our detectability limits, and 32.8% have at least one visual companion at angular separations below 6 arcsec. We find close companions (below 3 arcsec) for the 17.2% of the sample. The planet properties of this sample of non-isolated hosts are revised. We report one possible S-type binary (KOI-3158). We also report three possible false positives (KOIs 1230.01, 3649.01, and 3886.01) due to the presence of close companions. The BSC parameter is calculated for all the isolated targets and compared to both the value prior to any high-resolution image and, when possible, to observations from previous high-spatial resolution surveys in the Kepler sample.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3242;The Debiased Kuiper Belt: Our Solar System as a Debris Disk; S. M. Lawler,  the CFEPS Team;  The dust measured in debris disks traces the position of planetesimal belts. In our Solar System, we are also able to measure the largest planetesimals directly and can extrapolate down to make an estimate of the dust. The zodiacal dust from the asteroid belt is better constrained than the only rudimentary measurements of Kuiper belt dust. Dust models will thus be based on the current orbital distribution of the larger bodies which provide the collisional source. The orbital distribution of many Kuiper belt objects is strongly affected by dynamical interactions with Neptune, and the structure cannot be understood without taking this into account. We present the debiased Kuiper belt as measured by the Canada-France Ecliptic Plane Survey (CFEPS). This model includes the absolute populations for objects with diameters >100 km, measured orbital distributions, and size distributions of the components of the Kuiper belt: the classical belt (hot, stirred, and kernel components), the scattering disk, the detached objects, and the resonant objects (1:1, 5:4, 4:3, 3:2 including Kozai subcomponent, 5:3, 7:4, 2:1, 7:3, 5:2, 3:1, and 5:1). Because a large fraction of known debris disks are consistent with dust at Kuiper belt distances from the host stars, the CFEPS Kuiper belt model provides an excellent starting point for a debris disk model, as the dynamical interactions with planets interior to the disk are well-understood and can be precisely modelled using orbital integrations. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Soares;  Through a semi-analytic approach of the Kozai resonance inside an MMR, we show phase diagrams (e,{\omega}) that suggest the possibility of a scattered particle, after being captured in an MMR with Neptune, to become a detached object. We ran several numerical integrations with thousands of particles perturbed by the four major planets, and there are cases with and without Neptune's residual migration. These were developed to check the semi-analytic approach and to better understand the dynamical mechanisms that produce the detached objects close to an MMR. The numerical simulations with and without a residual migration for Neptune stress the importance of a particular resonance mode, which we name the hibernating mode, on the formation of fossilized detached objects close to MMRs. When considering Neptune's residual migration we are able to show the formation of detached orbits. These objects are fossilized and cannot be trapped in the MMRs again. We find a ratio of the number of fossilized objects with moderate perihelion distance (35 < q < 40 au) to the number of objects with high perihelion distance (q > 40 au) as 3.0/1 for objects close to the 2:5, and 1.7/1 for objects close to the 1:3 resonance. We estimate that the two fossilized population have a total mass between 0.1 and 0.3 Pluto's mass. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3253;Chemistry in an Evolving Protoplanetary Disk: Effects on Terrestrial  Planet Composition; John Moriarty,  Nikku Madhusudhan,  Debra Fischer;  The composition of planets is largely determined by the chemical and dynamical evolution of the disk during planetesimal formation and growth. To predict the diversity of exoplanet compositions, previous works modeled planetesimal composition as the equilibrium chemical composition of a proto- planetary disk at a single time. However, planetesimals form over an extended period of time, during which, elements sequentially condense out of the gas as the disk cools and are accreted onto planetesi- mals. To account for the evolution of the disk during planetesimal formation, we couple models of disk chemistry and dynamics with a prescription for planetesimal formation. We then follow the growth of these planetesimals into terrestrial planets with N-body simulations of late stage planet formation to evaluate the effect of sequential condensation on the bulk composition of planets. We find that our model produces results similar to those of earlier models for disks with C/O ratios close to the solar value (0.54). However, in disks with C/O ratios greater than 0.8, carbon rich planetesimals form throughout a much larger radial range of the disk. Furthermore, our model produces carbon rich planetesimals in disks with C/O ratios as low as ~0.65, which is not possible in the static equilibrium chemistry case. These results suggest that (1) there may be a large population of short period carbon rich planets around moderately carbon enhanced stars (0.65 < C/O < 0.8) and (2) carbon rich planets can form throughout the terrestrial planet region around carbon rich stars (C/O > 0.8). ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3283;Accreting planets as dust dams in `transition' discs; James E. Owen;  We investigate under what circumstances an embedded planet in a protoplanetary disc may sculpt the dust distribution such that it observationally presents as a `transition' disc. We concern ourselves with `transition' discs that have large holes ($\gtrsim 10$ AU) and high accretion rates ($\sim 10^{-9}-10^{-8}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$). Particularly, those discs which photoevaporative models struggle to explain. Assuming the standard picture for how massive planets sculpt their parent discs, along with the observed accretion rates in `transition' discs, we find that the accretion luminosity from the forming planet is significant, and can dominate over the stellar luminosity at the gap edge. This planetary accretion luminosity can apply a significant radiation pressure to small ($s\lesssim 1\mu$m) dust particles provided they are suitably decoupled from the gas. Secular evolution calculations that account for the evolution of the gas and dust components in a disc with an embedded, accreting planet, show that only with the addition of the radiation pressure can we explain the full observed characteristics of a `transition' disc (NIR dip in the SED, mm cavity and high accretion rate). At suitably high planet masses ($\gtrsim 3-4$ M$_J$), radiation pressure from the accreting planet is able to hold back the small dust particles, producing a heavily dust-depleted inner disc that is optically thin (vertically and radially) to Infra-Red radiation. We use our models to calculate synthetic observations and present a observational evolutionary scenario for a forming planet, sculpting its parent disc. The planet-disc system will present as a `transition' disc with a dip in the SED, only when the planet mass and planetary accretion rate is high enough. At other times it will present as a disc with a primordial SED, but with a cavity in the mm, as observed in a handful of protoplanetary discs. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3284;PynPoint Code for Exoplanet Imaging; Adam Amara,  Sascha P. Quanz,  Joel Akeret (ETH Zurich, Department of Physics, Wolfgang Pauli Strasse, Switzerland);  We announce the public release of PynPoint, a Python package that we have developed for analysing exoplanet data taken with the angular differential imaging observing technique. In particular, PynPoint is designed to model the point spread function of the central star and to subtract its flux contribution to reveal nearby faint companion planets. The current version of the package does this correction by using a principal component analysis method to build a basis set for modelling the point spread function of the observations. We demonstrate the performance of the package by reanalysing publicly available data on the exoplanet beta Pictoris b, which consists of close to 24,000 individual image frames. We show that PynPoint is able to analyse this typical data in roughly 1.5 minutes on a Mac Pro, when the number of images is reduced by co-adding in sets of 5. The main computational work parallelises well as a result of a reliance on SciPy and NumPy functions. For this calculation the peak memory load is 6Gb, which can be run comfortably on most workstations. A simpler calculation, by co-adding over 50, takes 3 seconds with a peak memory usage of 600 Mb. This can be performed easily on a laptop. In developing the package we have modularised the code so that we will be able to extend functionality in future releases, through the inclusion of more modules, without it affecting the users application programming interface. We distribute the PynPoint package through the central PyPi sever, and the documentation is available online (this http URL). ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM)"

Malavolta;  We present four new light curves of transiting exoplanets WASP-1b and HAT-P-20b, observed within the TASTE (The Asiago Search for Transit timing variations of Exoplanets) project. We re-analyzed light curves from the literature in a homogeneous way, calculating a refined ephemeris and orbital-physical parameters for both objects. WASP-1b does not show any significant Transit Timing Variation signal at the 120 s-level. As for HAT-P-20b, we detected a deviation from our re-estimated linear ephemeris that could be ascribed to the presence of a perturber or, more probably, to a previously unnoticed high level of stellar activity. The rotational period of HAT-P-20 A we obtained from archival data (P_rot ~ 14.5 days), combined with its optical variability and strong emission of CaII H&K lines, is consistent with a young stellar age (< 1 Gyr) and support the hypothesis that stellar activity may be responsible of the measured deviations of the transit times. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3291;Gravito-Turbulent Disks in 3D: Turbulent Velocities vs. Depth; Ji-Ming Shi,  Eugene Chiang;"  Characterizing turbulence in protoplanetary disks is crucial for understanding how they accrete and spawn planets. Recent measurements of spectral line broadening promise to diagnose turbulence, with different lines probing different depths. We use 3D local hydrodynamic simulations of cooling, self-gravitating disks to resolve how motions driven by ""gravito-turbulence"" vary with height. We find that gravito-turbulence is practically as vigorous at altitude as at depth: even though gas at altitude is much too rarefied to be itself self-gravitating, it is strongly forced by self-gravitating overdensities at the midplane. The long-range nature of gravity means that turbulent velocities are nearly uniform vertically, increasing by just a factor of 2 from midplane to surface, even as the density ranges over nearly three orders of magnitude. The insensitivity of gravito-turbulence to height contrasts with the behavior of disks afflicted by the magnetorotational instability (MRI); in the latter case, non-circular velocities increase by at least a factor of 15 from midplane to surface, with various non-ideal effects only magnifying this factor. The distinct vertical profiles of gravito-turbulence vs. MRI turbulence may be used in conjunction with measurements of non-thermal linewidths at various depths to identify the source of transport in protoplanetary disks.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3437;Convective overstability in accretion disks: 3D linear analysis and  nonlinear saturation; Wladimir Lyra;  Recently, Klahr & Hubbard (2014) claimed that a hydrodynamical linear overstability exists in protoplanetary disks, powered by buoyancy in the presence of thermal relaxation. We analyse this claim, confirming it through rigorous compressible linear analysis. We model the system numerically, reproducing the linear growth rate for all cases studied. We also study the saturated properties of the overstability in the shearing box, finding that the saturated state produces finite amplitude fluctuations strong enough to trigger the subcritical baroclinic instability. Saturation leads to a fast burst of enstrophy in the box, and a large-scale vortex develops in the course of the next $\approx$100 orbits. The amount of angular momentum transport achieved is of the order of $\alpha \approx 10^{-3}$, as in compressible SBI models. For the first time, a self-sustained 3D vortex is produced from linear amplitude perturbation of a quiescent base state. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Irwin,  Ryan Varley,  Enzo Pascale;"  We demonstrate the effectiveness of the Exoplanet Characterisation Observatory mission concept for constraining the atmospheric properties of hot and warm gas giants and super Earths. Synthetic primary and secondary transit spectra for a range of planets are passed through EChOSim (Waldmann & Pascale 2014) to obtain the expected level of noise for different observational scenarios; these are then used as inputs for the NEMESIS atmospheric retrieval code and the retrieved atmospheric properties (temperature structure, composition and cloud properties) compared with the known input values, following the method of Barstow et al. (2013a). To correctly retrieve the temperature structure and composition of the atmosphere to within 2 {\sigma}, we find that we require: a single transit or eclipse of a hot Jupiter orbiting a sun-like (G2) star at 35 pc to constrain the terminator and dayside atmospheres; 20 transits or eclipses of a warm Jupiter orbiting a similar star; 10 transits/eclipses of a hot Neptune orbiting an M dwarf at 6 pc; and 30 transits or eclipses of a GJ1214b-like planet.

Kawaler,  Hans Kjeldsen,  Mikkel N. Lund,  Mia Lundkvist;  We present the characterization of the Kepler-93 exoplanetary system, based on three years of photometry gathered by the Kepler spacecraft. The duration and cadence of the Kepler observations, in tandem with the brightness of the star, enable unusually precise constraints on both the planet and its host. We conduct an asteroseismic analysis of the Kepler photometry and conclude that the star has an average density of 1.652+/-0.006 g/cm^3. Its mass of 0.911+/-0.033 M_Sun renders it one of the lowest-mass subjects of asteroseismic study. An analysis of the transit signature produced by the planet Kepler-93b, which appears with a period of 4.72673978+/-9.7x10^-7 days, returns a consistent but less precise measurement of the stellar density, 1.72+0.02-0.28 g/cm^3. The agreement of these two values lends credence to the planetary interpretation of the transit signal. The achromatic transit depth, as compared between Kepler and the Spitzer Space Telescope, supports the same conclusion. We observed seven transits of Kepler-93b with Spitzer, three of which we conducted in a new observing mode. The pointing strategy we employed to gather this subset of observations halved our uncertainty on the transit radius ratio R_p/R_star. We find, after folding together the stellar radius measurement of 0.919+/-0.011 R_Sun with the transit depth, a best-fit value for the planetary radius of 1.481+/-0.019 R_Earth. The uncertainty of 120 km on our measurement of the planet's size currently renders it one of the most precisely measured planetary radii outside of the Solar System. Together with the radius, the planetary mass of 3.8+/-1.5 M_Earth corresponds to a rocky density of 6.3+/-2.6 g/cm^3. After applying a prior on the plausible maximum densities of similarly-sized worlds between 1--1.5 R_Earth, we find that Kepler-93b possesses an average density within this group. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Farris;  Most standard descriptions of Type II migration state that massive, gap-opening planets must migrate at the viscous drift rate. This is based on the idea that the disk is separated into an inner and outer region and gas is considered unable to cross the gap. In fact, gas easily crosses the gap on horseshoe orbits, nullifying this necessary premise which would set the migration rate. In this work, it is demonstrated using highly accurate numerical calculations that the actual migration rate is dependent on disk and planet parameters, and can be significantly larger or smaller than the viscous drift rate. In the limiting case of a disk much more massive than the secondary, the migration rate saturates to a constant which is sensitive to disk parameters and is not necessarily of order viscous rate. In the opposite limit of a low-mass disk, the migration rate decreases linearly with disk mass. Steady-state solutions in the low disk mass limit show no pile-up outside the secondary's orbit, and no corresponding drainage of the inner disk. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3788;Chaotic zones around gravitating binaries; Ivan I. Shevchenko;  The extent of the continuous zone of chaotic orbits of a small-mass tertiary around a system of two gravitationally bound primaries (a double star, a double black hole, a binary asteroid, etc.) is estimated analytically, in function of the tertiary's orbital eccentricity. The separatrix map theory is used to demonstrate that the central continuous chaos zone emerges (above a threshold in the primaries mass ratio) due to overlapping of the orbital resonances corresponding to the integer ratios p:1 between the tertiary and the central binary periods. In this zone, the unlimited chaotic orbital diffusion of the tertiary takes place, up to its ejection from the system. The primaries mass ratio, above which such a chaotic zone is universally present at all initial eccentricities of the tertiary, is estimated. The diversity of the observed orbital configurations of biplanetary and circumbinary exosystems is shown to be in accord with the existence of the primaries mass parameter threshold. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3798;The Albedos of Kepler's Close-in super-Earths; Brice-Olivier Demory;  Exoplanet research focusing on the characterization of super-Earths is currently limited to those handful targets orbiting bright stars that are amenable to detailed study. This Letter proposes to look at alternative avenues to probe the surface and atmospheric properties of this category of planets, known to be ubiquitous in our galaxy. I conduct Markov Chain Monte Carlo lightcurve analyses for 97 Kepler close-in $R_P \lesssim 2.0 R_{\oplus}$ super-Earth candidates with the aim to detect their occultations at visible wavelengths. Brightness temperatures and geometric albedos in the Kepler bandpass are constrained for 27 super-Earth candidates. A hierarchical Bayesian modeling approach is then employed to characterize the population-level reflective properties of these close-in super-Earths. I find median geometric albedos $A_g$ in the Kepler bandpass ranging between 0.16 and 0.30, once decontaminated from thermal emission. These super-Earths geometric albedos are statistically larger than for hot Jupiters, which have medians $A_g$ ranging between 0.06 and 0.11. A subset of objects, including Kepler-10b, exhibit significantly larger albedos ($A_g\gtrsim$0.4). I argue that a better understanding of the incidence of stellar irradiation on planetary surface and atmospheric processes is key to explain the diversity in albedos observed for close-in super-Earths. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Irwin,  Olivier Mousis,  James A. Sinclair,  Rohini S. Giles;  The Texas Echelon cross Echelle Spectrograph (TEXES), mounted on NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF), was used to map mid-infrared ammonia absorption features on both Jupiter and Saturn in February 2013. Ammonia is the principle reservoir of nitrogen on the giant planets, and the ratio of isotopologues ($^{15}$N/$^{14}$N) can reveal insights into the molecular carrier (e.g., as N$_2$ or NH$_3$) of nitrogen to the forming protoplanets, and hence the source reservoirs from which these worlds accreted. We targeted two spectral intervals (900 and 960 cm$^{-1}$) that were relatively clear of terrestrial atmospheric contamination and contained close features of $^{14}$NH$_3$ and $^{15}$NH$_3$, allowing us to derive the ratio from a single spectrum without ambiguity due to radiometric calibration (the primary source of uncertainty in this study). We present the first ground-based determination of Jupiter's $^{15}$N/$^{14}$N ratio (in the range from $1.4\times10^{-3}$ to $2.5\times10^{-3}$), which is consistent with both previous space-based studies and with the primordial value of the protosolar nebula. On Saturn, we present the first upper limit on the $^{15}$N/$^{14}$N ratio of no larger than $2.0\times10^{-3}$ for the 900-cm$^{-1}$ channel and a less stringent requirement that the ratio be no larger than $2.8\times10^{-3}$ for the 960-cm$^{-1}$ channel ($1\sigma$ confidence). Specifically, the data rule out strong $^{15}$N-enrichments such as those observed in Titan's atmosphere and in cometary nitrogen compounds. To the extent possible with ground-based radiometric uncertainties, the saturnian and jovian $^{15}$N/$^{14}$N ratios appear indistinguishable, implying that $^{15}$N-enriched ammonia ices could not have been a substantial contributor to the bulk nitrogen inventory of either planet, favouring the accretion of primordial N$_2$ from the gas phase or as low-temperature ices. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3991;Radial Stresses and Energy Transport in Accretion Disks; Alexander Hubbard,  Colin P. McNally,  Jeffrey S. Oishi,  Wladimir Lyra,  Mordecai-Mark Mac Low;  Early in the study of viscous accretion disks it was realized that energy transfers from distant sources must be important, not least because the flow at the disk midplane in the bulk of the disk is likely outwards, out of the gravitational potential well. If the source of the viscosity is powered by accretion, such as in the case of the magneto-rotational instability, such distant energy sources must lie in the innermost regions of the disk, where accretion occurs even at the midplane. We argue here that modulations in this energy supply can alter the accretion rate on dynamical, rather than far longer viscous, time scales. This means that both the steady state value of and fluctuations in the inner disk's accretion rate, depending on the details of the inner boundary condition and occurring on the inner disk's rapid evolution time, can affect the outer disk. This is particularly interesting because observations have shown that disk accretion is not steady (e.g.~EX Lupi type objects). We also note that the power supplied to shearing boxes is set by the boxes themselves rather than the physical energy fluxes in a global disk. That is, their saturated magnetic field is not subject to the full set of energy constraints present in an actual disk. Our analysis suggests that large scale radial transport of energy has a critical impact on the evolution and variability of accretion disks. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)"

Wainscoat,  Nader Haghighipour;  We have calculated the coherence and detectable lifetimes of synthetic near-Earth object (NEO) families created by catastrophic disruption of a progenitor as it suffers a very close Earth approach. The closest or slowest approaches yield the most violent `s-class' disruption events. We found that the average slope of the absolute magnitude (H) distribution, $N(H)\propto10^{(0.55\pm0.04)\,H}$, for the fragments in the s-class families is steeper than the slope of the NEO population \citep{mainzer2011} in the same size range. The families remain coherent as statistically significant clusters of orbits within the NEO population for an average of $\bar\tau_c = (14.7\pm0.6)\times10^3$ years after disruption. The s-class families are detectable with the techniques developed by \citet{fu2005} and \citet{Schunova2012} for an average duration ($\bar\tau_{det}$) ranging from about 2,000 to about 12,000 years for progenitors in the absolute magnitude ($H_p$) range from 20 to 13 corresponding to diameters in the range from about 0.5 to 10$\km$ respectively. The short detectability lifetime explains why zero NEO families have been discovered to-date. Nonetheless, every tidal disruption event of a progenitor with D$>0.5\km$ is capable of producing several million fragments in the $1\meter$ to $10\meter$ diameter range that can contribute to temporary local density enhancements of small NEOs in Earth's vicinity. We expect that there are about 1,200 objects in the steady state NEO population in this size range due to tidal disruption assuming that one $1\km$ diameter NEO tidally disrupts at Earth every 2,500 years. These objects may be suitable targets for asteroid retrieval missions due to their Earth-like orbits with corresponding low $v_{\infty}$. The fragments from the tidal disruptions at Earth have $\sim5\times$ the collision probability with Earth compared to the background NEO population. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

These data span a range of phase angles, including a rare crescent phase view. For each epoch, the satellite acquired near-infrared and mid-infrared full-disk images, and partial-disk spectra at 0.26-0.65 microns (R~500) and 1.17-2.48 microns (R~50). Spectra show strong absorption features due to water vapor and ozone, which is a biosignature gas. We perform a significant recalibration of the UV-visible spectra and provide the first comparison of high-resolution visible Earth spectra to the NASA Astrobiology Institute's Virtual Planetary Laboratory three-dimensional spectral Earth model. We find good agreement with the observations, reproducing the absolute brightness and dynamic range at all wavelengths for all observation epochs, thus validating the model to within the ~10% data calibration uncertainty. Data-model comparisons reveal a strong ocean glint signature in the crescent phase dataset, which is well matched by our model predictions throughout the observed wavelength range. This provides the first observational test of a technique that could be used to determine exoplanet habitability from disk-integrated observations at visible and near-infrared wavelengths, where the glint signal is strongest. We examine the detection of the ozone 255 nm Hartley and 400-700 nm Chappuis bands. While the Hartley band is the strongest ozone feature in Earth's spectrum, false positives for its detection could exist. Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings for future exoplanet characterization missions. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Salazar (GIGA/Escuela Ambiental/UdeA),  Pablo Cuartas-Restrepo (FACom/IF/UdeA),  German Poveda (Escuela de Geociencias y Medio Ambiente/UNAL);  In this paper we discuss and illustrate the hypothesis that life substantially alters the state of a planetary environment and therefore, modifies the limits of the HZ as estimated for an uninhabited planet. This hypothesis lead to the introduction of the Habitable Zone for Inhabited planets (hereafter InHZ), defined here as the region where the complex interaction between life and its abiotic environment is able to produce plausible equilibrium states with the necessary physical conditions for the existence and persistence of life itself. We support our hypothesis of an InHZ with three theoretical arguments, multiple evidences coming from observations of the Earth system, several conceptual experiments and illustrative numerical simulations. Conceptually the diference between the InHZ and the Abiotic HZ (AHZ) depends on unique and robust properties of life as an emergent physical phenomenon and not necesarily on the particular life forms bearing in the planet. Our aim here is to provide conceptual basis for the development of InHZ models incorporating consistently life-environment interactions. Although previous authors have explored the effects of life on habitability there is a gap in research developing the reasons why life should be systematically included at determining the HZ limits. We do not provide here definitive limits to the InHZ but we show through simple numerical models (as a parable of an inhabited planet) how the limits of the AHZ could be modified by including plausible interactions between biota and its environment. These examples aim also at posing the question that if limits of the HZ could be modified by the presence of life in those simple dynamical systems how will those limits change if life is included in established models of the AHZ. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems (nlin.AO); Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph); Geophysics (physics.geo-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.4738;Disruption of co-orbital (1:1) planetary resonances during gas-driven  orbital migration; Arnaud Pierens,  Sean Raymond;  Planets close to their stars are thought to form farther out and migrate inward due to angular momentum exchange with gaseous protoplanetary disks. This process can produce systems of planets in co-orbital (Trojan or 1:1) resonance, in which two planets share the same orbit, usually separated by 60 degrees. Co-orbital systems are detectable among the planetary systems found by the Kepler mission either directly or by transit timing variations. However, no co-orbital systems have been found within the thousands of Kepler planets and candidates. Here we study the orbital evolution of co-orbital planets embedded in a protoplanetary disk using a grid-based hydrodynamics code. We show that pairs of similar-mass planets in co-orbital resonance are disrupted during large-scale orbital migration. Destabilization occurs when one or both planets is near the critical mass needed to open a gap in the gaseous disk. A confined gap is opened that spans the 60 degree azimuthal separation between planets. This alters the torques imparted by the disk on each planet -- pushing the leading planet outward and the trailing planet inward -- and disrupts the resonance. The mechanism applies to systems in which the two planets' masses differ by a factor of two or less. In a simple flared disk model the critical mass for gap opening varies from a few Earth masses at the inner edge of the disk to 1 Saturn-mass at 5 AU. A pair of co-orbital planets with masses in this range that migrates will enter a region where the planets are at the gap-opening limit. At that point the resonance is disrupted. We therefore predict an absence of planets on co-orbital configurations with masses in the super-Earth to Saturn mass range with similar masses. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Stevenson,  on behalf of ExoPAG SAG-X;  [Abridged] We have only been able to comprehensively characterize the atmospheres of a handful of transiting planets, because most orbit faint stars. TESS will discover transiting planets orbiting the brightest stars, enabling, in principle, an atmospheric survey of 10^2 to 10^3 bright hot Jupiters and warm sub-Neptunes. Uniform observations of such a statistically significant sample would provide leverage to understand---and learn from---the diversity of short-period planets. We argue that the best way to maximize the scientific returns of TESS is with a follow-up space mission consisting of a ~1 m telescope with an optical--NIR spectrograph: it could measure molecular absorption for non-terrestrial planets, as well as eclipses and phase variations for the hottest jovians. Such a mission could observe up to 10^3 transits per year, thus enabling it to survey a large fraction of the bright (J<11) TESS planets. JWST could be used to perform detailed atmospheric characterization of the most interesting transiting targets (transit, eclipse, and---when possible---phase-resolved spectroscopy). TESS is also expected to discover a few temperate terrestrial planets transiting nearby M-Dwarfs. Characterizing these worlds will be time-intensive: JWST will need months to provide tantalizing constraints on the presence of an atmosphere, planetary rotational state, clouds, and greenhouse gases. Future flagship missions should be designed to provide better constraints on the habitability of M-Dwarf temperate terrestrial planets. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

As the enstatite chondrites are thought to have formed in a reduced environment at higher temperatures than carbonaceous chondrites, they constitute an interesting comparative material to test the heterogeneities of the IOM in the solar system and to constrain the processes that could affect IOM during solar system evolution. The SAH 97096 IOM is found in situ: as submicrometer grains in the network of fine-grained matrix occurring mostly around chondrules and as inclusions in metallic nodules, where the carbonaceous matter appears to be more graphitized. IOM in these two settings has very similar $\delta^{15}N$ and $\delta^{13}C$; this supports the idea that graphitized inclusions in metal could be formed by metal catalytic graphitization of matrix IOM. A detailed comparison between the IOM extracted from a fresh part and a terrestrially weathered part of SAH 97096 shows the similarity between both IOM samples in spite of the high degree of mineral alteration in the latter. The isolated IOM exhibits a heterogeneous polyaromatic macromolecular structure, sometimes highly graphitized, without any detectable free radicals and deuterium-heterogeneity and having mean H- and N-isotopic compositions in the range of values observed for carbonaceous chondrites. It contains some submicrometer-sized areas highly enriched in $^{15}N$ ($\delta^{15}N$ up to 1600 permil). These observations reinforce the idea that the IOM found in carbonaceous chondrites is a common component widespread in the solar system. Most of the features of SAH 97096 IOM could be explained by the thermal modification of this main component. ";Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

It exhibits several peculiar features, most notably its polarimetric behavior. In recent years other objects sharing the same property (collectively known as ""Barbarians"") have been discovered. Interferometric observations in the mid-infrared with the ESO VLTI suggested that (234) Barbara might have a bi-lobated shape or even a large companion satellite. We use a large set of 57 optical lightcurves acquired between 1979 and 2014, together with the timings of two stellar occultations in 2009, to determine the rotation period, spin-vector coordinates, and 3-D shape of (234) Barbara, using two different shape reconstruction algorithms. By using the lightcurves combined to the results obtained from stellar occultations, we are able to show that the shape of (234) Barbara exhibits large concave areas. Possible links of the shape to the polarimetric properties and the object evolution are discussed. We also show that VLTI data can be modeled without the presence of a satellite.

Schmitt;  Giant gas planets in close proximity to their host stars experience strong irradiation. In extreme cases photoevaporation causes a transonic, planetary wind and the persistent mass loss can possibly affect the planetary evolution. We have identified nine hot Jupiter systems in the vicinity of the Sun, in which expanded planetary atmospheres should be detectable through Lyman alpha transit spectroscopy according to predictions. We use X-ray observations with Chandra and XMM-Newton of seven of these targets to derive the high-energy irradiation level of the planetary atmospheres and the resulting mass loss rates. We further derive improved Lyman alpha luminosity estimates for the host stars including interstellar absorption. According to our estimates WASP-80 b, WASP-77 b, and WASP-43 b experience the strongest mass loss rates, exceeding the mass loss rate of HD 209458 b, where an expanded atmosphere has been confirmed. Furthermore, seven out of nine targets might be amenable to Lyman alpha transit spectroscopy. Finally, we check the possibility of angular momentum transfer from the hot Jupiters to the host stars in the three binary systems among our sample, but find only weak indications for increased stellar rotation periods of WASP-77 and HAT-P-20. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)"

Recently a number of new datasets have been released that probe the physical properties of a large number of asteroids, many of which are members of identified families. We review these data sets and the composite properties of asteroid families derived from this plethora of new data.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01067;Micron-scale D/H heterogeneity in chondrite matrices: a signature of the  pristine solar system water?; Laurette Piani,  FranÃ§ois Robert,  Laurent Remusat;  Organic matter and hydrous silicates are intimately mixed in the matrix of chondrites and in-situ determination of their individual D/H ratios is therefore challenging. Nevertheless, the D/H ratio of each pure component in this mixture should yield a comprehensible signature of the origin and evolution of water and organic matter in our solar system. We measured hydrogen isotope ratios of organic and hydrous silicates in the matrices of two carbonaceous chondrites (Orgueil CI1 and Renazzo CR2) and one unequilibrated ordinary chondrite (Semarkona, LL3.0). A novel protocol was adopted, involving NanoSIMS imaging of H isotopes of monoatomatic ($H^-$) and molecular ($OH^-$) secondary ions collected at the same location. This allowed the most enriched component with respect to D to be identified in the mixture. Using this protocol, we found that in carbonaceous chondrites the isotopically homogeneous hydrous silicates are mixed with D-rich organic matter. The opposite was observed in Semarkona. Hydrous silicates in Semarkona display highly heterogeneous D/H ratios, ranging from $150$ to $1800$ ${\times}$ $10^{-6}$ (${\delta}D_{SMOW} = -40$ to $10,600$ permil). Organic matter in Semarkona does not show such large isotopic variations. This suggests limited isotopic exchange between the two phases during aqueous alteration. Our study greatly expands the range of water isotopic values measured so far in solar system objects. This D-rich water reservoir was sampled by the LL ordinary chondrite parent body and an estimate (up to 9 %) of its relative contribution to the D/H ratio of water in Oort cloud family comets is proposed. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01160;Critical core mass for enriched envelopes: the role of H2O condensation; J. Venturini,  Y. Alibert,  W. Benz,  M. Ikoma;  Context. Within the core accretion scenario of planetary formation, most simulations performed so far always assume the accreting envelope to have a solar composition. From the study of meteorite showers on Earth and numerical simulations, we know that planetesimals must undergo thermal ablation and disruption when crossing a protoplanetary envelope. Once the protoplanet has acquired an atmosphere, the primordial envelope gets enriched in volatiles and silicates from the planetesimals. This change of envelope composition during the formation can have a significant effect in the final atmospheric composition and on the formation timescale of giant planets. Aims. To investigate the physical implications of considering the envelope enrichment of protoplanets due to the disruption of icy planetesimals during their way to the core. Particular focus is placed on the effect on the critical core mass for envelopes where condensation of water can occur. Methods. Internal structure models are numerically solved with the implementation of updated opacities for all ranges of metallicities and the software CEA to compute the equation of state. CEA computes the chemical equilibrium for an arbitrary mixture of gases and allows the condensation of some species, including water. This means that the latent heat of phase transitions is consistently incorporated in the total energy budget. Results. The critical core mass is found to decrease significantly when an enriched envelope composition is considered in the internal structure equations. A particular strong reduction of the critical core mass is obtained for planets whose envelope metallicity is larger than Z=0.45 when the outer boundary conditions are suitable for condensation of water to occur in the top layers of the atmosphere. We show that this effect is qualitatively preserved when the atmosphere is out of chemical equilibrium. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Statler;"  The Yarkovsky effect describes a small but significant force that affects the orbital motion of meteoroids and asteroids smaller than $30-40$ kilometers in diameter. It is caused by sunlight; when these bodies heat up in the Sun, they eventually re-radiate the energy away in the thermal waveband, which in turn creates a tiny thrust. This recoil acceleration is much weaker than solar and planetary gravitational forces, but it can produce measurable orbital changes over decades and substantial orbital effects over millions to billions of years. The same physical phenomenon also creates a thermal torque that, complemented by a torque produced by scattered sunlight, can modify the rotation rates and obliquities of small bodies as well. This rotational variant has been coined the Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (YORP) effect. During the past decade or so, the Yarkovsky and YORP effects have been used to explore and potentially resolve a number of unsolved mysteries in planetary science dealing with small bodies. Here we review the main results to date, and preview the goals for future work. ";Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01299;Compound Chondrules fused Cold; Alexander Hubbard;"  About 4-5% of chondrules are compound: two separate chondrules stuck together. This is commonly believed to be the result of the two component chondrules having collided shortly after forming, while still molten. This allows high velocity impacts to result in sticking. However, at T ~ 1100K, the temperature below which chondrules collide as solids (and hence usually bounce), coalescence times for droplets of appropriate composition are measured in tens of seconds. Even at 1025K, at which temperature theory predicts that the chondrules must have collided extremely slowly to have stuck together, the coalescence time scale is still less than an hour. These coalescence time scales are too short for the collision of molten chondrules to explain the observed frequency of compound chondrules. We suggest instead a scenario where chondrules stuck together in slow collisions while fully solid; and the resulting chondrule pair was subsequently briefly heated to a temperature in the range of 900-1025K. In that temperature window the coalescence time is finite but long, covering a span of hours to a decade. This is particularly interesting because those temperatures are precisely the critical window for thermally ionized MRI activity, so compound chondrules provide a possible probe into that vital regime.

Han,  J.-Y. Choi,  K.-H. Hwang,  Y. K. Jung,  H. Park;  High-magnification gravitational microlensing events provide an important channel of detecting planetary systems with multiple giants located at their birth places. In order to investigate the potential existence of additional planets, we reanalyze the light curves of the eight high-magnification microlensing events for each of which a single planet was previously detected. The analyzed events include OGLE-2005-BLG-071, OGLE-2005-BLG-169, MOA-2007-BLG-400, MOA-2008-BLG-310, MOA-2009-BLG-319, MOA-2009-BLG-387, MOA-2010-BLG-477, and MOA-2011-BLG-293. We find that including an additional planet improves fits with $\Delta\chi^2 < 80$ for seven out of eight analyzed events. For MOA-2009-BLG-319, the improvement is relatively big with $\Delta\chi^2 \sim 143$. From inspection of the fits, we find that the improvement of the fits is attributed to systematics in data. Although no clear evidence of additional planets is found, it is still possible to constrain the existence of additional planets in the parameter space. For this purpose, we construct exclusion diagrams showing the confidence levels excluding the existence of an additional planet as a function of its separation and mass ratio. We also present the exclusion ranges of additional planets with 90\% confidence level for Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus-mass planets. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01472;Contribution to the study of the resonant rotation in the Solar System; BenoÃ®t Noyelles;  This HDR-thesis is devoted to the study of the rotation of the natural satellites of the giant planets and of Mercury. These bodies have a resonant rotation. Most of the natural satellites rotate synchronously, showing the same hemisphere to their parent planet (1:1 spin-orbit resonance). The case of Mercury is unique since its spin rate is exactly 1.5 its mean motion (3:2 spin-orbit resonance). These two configurations are dynamical equilibria, reached after damping of the initial rotation of the relevant bodies. Thus, the rotation quantities are a signature of the interior, in particular of a putative global ocean. This manuscript divides into 3 parts. The first part is devoted to the synchronous resonance. It presents different models of rotation from a fully rigid body to a one with a global subsurfacic ocean. We always consider all the degrees of freedom simultaneously, using analytical and numerical resolutions. These models are applied on Titan, Callisto, Janus, Epimetheus, Mimas, Hyperion, and Io. The second part presents the resonant rotation of Mercury, target of the two space missions MESSENGER and BepiColombo. We reveal in particular how it got trapped into its 3:2 resonance. The final part presents an algorithm I have elaborated to tackle the rotational problems. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01834;Constraining the orbits of sub-stellar companions imaged over short  orbital arcs; Tim D. Pearce,  Mark C. Wyatt,  Grant M. Kennedy;  Imaging a star's companion at multiple epochs over a short orbital arc provides only four of the six coordinates required for a unique orbital solution. Probability distributions of possible solutions are commonly generated by Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, but these are biased by priors and may not probe the full parameter space. We suggest alternative methods to characterise possible orbits, which compliment the MCMC technique. Firstly the allowed ranges of orbital elements are prior-independent, and we provide means to calculate these ranges without numerical analyses. Hence several interesting constraints (including whether a companion even can be bound, its minimum possible semi-major axis and its minimum eccentricity) may be quickly computed using our relations as soon as orbital motion is detected. We also suggest an alternative to posterior probability distributions as a means to present possible orbital elements, namely contour plots of elements as functions of line of sight coordinates. These plots are prior-independent, readily show degeneracies between elements and allow readers to extract orbital solutions themselves. This approach is particularly useful when there are other constraints on the geometry, for example if a companion's orbit is assumed to be aligned with a disc. As examples we apply our methods to several imaged sub-stellar companions including Fomalhaut b, and for the latter object we show how different origin hypotheses affect its possible orbital solutions. We also examine visual companions of A- and G-type main sequence stars in the Washington Double Star Catalogue, and show that $\gtrsim50$ per cent must be unbound. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01847;Chondrule trace element geochemistry at the mineral scale; Emmanuel Jacquet,  Olivier Alard,  Matthieu Gounelle;  We report trace element analyses from mineral phases in chondrules from carbonaceous chondrites (Vigarano, Renazzo and Acfer 187), carried out by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Results are similar in all three meteorites. Mesostasis has Rare Earth Element (REE) concentrations of 10-20 x CI. Low-Ca pyroxene has light REE (LREE) concentrations near 0.1 x CI and heavy REE (HREE) near 1 x CI respectively. Olivine has HREE concentrations at 0.1-1 x CI and LREE around 10-2 x CI. The coarsest olivine crystals tend to have the most fractionated REE patterns, indicative of equilibrium partitioning. Low-Ca pyroxene in the most pyroxene-rich chondrules tends to have the lowest REE concentrations. Type I chondrules seem to have undergone a significant degree of batch crystallization (as opposed to fractional crystallization), which requires cooling rates slower than 1-100 K/h. This would fill the gap between igneous CAIs and type II chondrules. The anticorrelation between REE abundances and pyroxene mode may be understood as due to dilution by addition of silica to the chondrule melt, as in the gas-melt interaction scenario of Libourel et al. (2006). The rapid cooling rate (of the order of 1000 K/h) which seems recorded by low-Ca pyroxene, contrasted with the more diverse record of olivine, may point to a nonlinear cooling history or suggest that formation of pyroxene-rich chondrule margins was an event distinct from the crystallization of the interior. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Save for a few anomalous grains, Ni-normalized trace element patterns are similar for all three petrographical settings, with largely unfractionated refractory siderophile elements and depleted volatile Au, Cu, Ag, S. All types of grains are interpreted to derive from a common precursor approximated by the least melted, fine-grained objects in CR chondrites. This also excludes recondensation of metal vapor as the origin of the bulk of margin grains. The metal precursors presumably formed by incomplete condensation, with evidence for high-temperature isolation of refractory platinum-group-element (PGE)-rich condensates before mixing with lower temperature PGE-depleted condensates. The rounded shape of the Ni-rich, interior grains indicates melting and equilibration with silicates upon slow cooling (1-100 K/h), largely by oxidation/evaporation of Fe. We propose that Ni-poorer, amoeboid margin grains, often included in the pyroxene-rich periphery common to type I chondrules, result from less intense processing of a rim accreted onto the chondrule subsequent to the melting event recorded by the interior. This means either that there were two separate heating events, which formed olivine/interior grains and pyroxene/margin grains, respectively, between which dust was accreted around the chondrule, or there was a single high-temperature event, of which the chondrule margin record a late ""quenching phase"", in which case dust accreted onto chondrules while they were molten. In the latter case, high dust concentrations in the chondrule-forming region are indicated. ";Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01860;SPH calculations of asteroid disruptions: The role of pressure dependent  failure models; Martin Jutzi;  We present recent improvements of the modeling of the disruption of strength dominated bodies using the Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) technique. The improvements include an updated strength model and a friction model, which are successfully tested by a comparison with laboratory experiments. In the modeling of catastrophic disruptions of asteroids, a comparison between old and new strength models shows no significant deviation in the case of targets which are initially non-porous, fully intact and have a homogeneous structure (such as the targets used in the study by Benz&Asphaug (1999). However, for many cases (e.g. initially partly or fully damaged targets, rubble-pile structures, etc.) we find that it is crucial that friction is taken into account and the material has a pressure dependent shear strength. Our investigations of the catastrophic disruption threshold $Q^*_{D}$ as a function of target properties and target sizes up to a few 100 km show that a fully damaged target modeled without friction has a $Q^*_{D}$ which is significantly (5-10 times) smaller than in the case where friction is included. When the effect of the energy dissipation due to compaction (pore crushing) is taken into account as well, the targets become even stronger ($Q^*_{D}$ is increased by a factor of 2-3). On the other hand, cohesion is found to have an negligible effect at large scales and is only important at scales $\lesssim$ 1km. Our results show the relative effects of strength, friction and porosity on the outcome of collisions among small ($\lesssim$ 1000 km) bodies. These results will be used in a future study to improve existing scaling laws for the outcome of collisions (e.g. Leinhardt&Stewart, 2012). ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Trigo-RodrÃ­guez;  Despite ablation and drag processes associated with atmospheric entry of meteoroids were a subject of intensive study over the last century, little attention was devoted to interpret the observed fireball terminal height. This is a key parameter because it not only depends on the initial mass, but also on the bulk physical properties of the meteoroids and hence of their ability to ablate in the atmosphere. In this work we have developed a new approach that is tested using the fireball terminal heights observed by the Meteorite Observation and Recovery Project operated in Canada between 1970-1985 (hereafter referred as MORP). We then compare them to the calculation made. Our results clearly show that the new methodology is able to forecast the degree of deepening of meteoroids in the Earth's atmosphere. Then, this approach has important applications in predicting the impact hazard from cm- to meter-sized bodies that are represented, in part, in the MORP bolide list. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01946;The pH of Enceladus' ocean; Christopher Glein,  John Baross,  Hunter Waite;"  Observational data from the Cassini spacecraft are used to obtain a chemical model of ocean water on Enceladus. The model indicates that Enceladus' ocean is a Na-Cl-CO3 solution with an alkaline pH of ~11-12. The dominance of aqueous NaCl is a feature that Enceladus' ocean shares with terrestrial seawater, but the ubiquity of dissolved Na2CO3 suggests that soda lakes are more analogous to the Enceladus ocean. The high pH implies that the hydroxide ion should be relatively abundant, while divalent metals should be present at low concentrations owing to buffering by clays and carbonates on the ocean floor. The high pH is interpreted to be a key consequence of serpentinization of chondritic rock, as predicted by prior geochemical reaction path models; although degassing of CO2 from the ocean may also play a role depending on the efficiency of mixing processes in the ocean. Serpentinization leads to the generation of H2, a geochemical fuel that can support both abiotic and biological synthesis of organic molecules such as those that have been detected in Enceladus' plume. Serpentinization and H2 generation should have occurred on Enceladus, like on the parent bodies of aqueously altered meteorites; but it is unknown whether these critical processes are still taking place, or if Enceladus' rocky core has been completely altered by past hydrothermal activity. The high pH also suggests that the delivery of oxidants from the surface to the ocean has not been significant, and the rocky core did not experience partial melting and igneous differentiation. On the other hand, the pH is compatible with life as we know it; life on Earth may have begun under similar conditions, and serpentinites on Earth support microbial communities that are centered on H2 that is provided by water-rock reactions.

Although thermal tides cause Venus to rotate retrogradely, simple scaling arguments tend to attribute this peculiarity to the massive Venusian atmosphere. Using a global climate model, we show that even a relatively thin atmosphere can drive terrestrial planets' rotation away from synchronicity. We derive a more realistic atmospheric tide model that predicts four asynchronous equilibrium spin states, two being stable, when the amplitude of the thermal tide exceeds a threshold that is met for habitable Earth-like planets with a 1-bar atmosphere around stars more massive than 0.5-0.7Msun. Thus, many recently discovered terrestrial planets could exhibit asynchronous spin-orbit rotation, even with a thin atmosphere. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics (physics.ao-ph)"

This best-fit model is composed of a hot continuous power-law disk and two rings. We characterized the grain temperature profile and found that the grains in all three populations are emitting at temperatures higher than blackbodies. In particular, the grains in the continuous disk are unusually warm; even when considering small graphite particles as the composition.

";  \We present the sixth catalog of Kepler candidate planets based on nearly 4 years of high precision photometry. This catalog builds on the legacy of previous catalogs released by the Kepler project and includes 1493 new Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs) of which 554 are planet candidates, and 131 of these candidates have best fit radii <1.5 R_earth. This brings the total number of KOIs and planet candidates to 7305 and 4173 respectively. We suspect that many of these new candidates at the low signal-to-noise limit may be false alarms created by instrumental noise, and discuss our efforts to identify such objects. We re-evaluate all previously published KOIs with orbital periods of >50 days to provide a consistently vetted sample that can be used to improve planet occurrence rate calculations. We discuss the performance of our planet detection algorithms, and the consistency of our vetting products. The full catalog is publicly available at the NASA Exoplanet Archive. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Richardson,  B. J. Thompson,  A. Pulkkinen,  R. Evans,  T. Nieves-Chinchilla;  The process by which the Sun affects the terrestrial environment on short timescales is predominately driven by the amount of magnetic reconnection between the solar wind and Earth's magnetosphere. Reconnection occurs most efficiently when the solar wind magnetic field has a southward component. The most severe impacts are during the arrival of a coronal mass ejection (CME) when the magnetosphere is both compressed and magnetically connected to the heliospheric environment. Unfortunately, forecasting magnetic vectors within coronal mass ejections remains elusive. Here we report how, by combining a statistically robust helicity rule for a CME's solar origin with a simplified flux rope topology the magnetic vectors within the Earth-directed segment of a CME can be predicted. In order to test the validity of this proof-of-concept architecture for estimating the magnetic vectors within CMEs, a total of eight CME events (between 2010 and 2014) have been investigated. With a focus on the large false alarm of January 2014, this work highlights the importance of including the early evolutionary effects of a CME for forecasting purposes. The angular rotation in the predicted magnetic field closely follows the broad rotational structure seen within the in situ data. This time-varying field estimate is implemented into a process to quantitatively predict a time-varying Kp index that is described in detail in paper II. Future statistical work, quantifying the uncertainties in this process, may improve the more heuristic approach used by early forecasting systems. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Space Physics (physics.space-ph)"

MontaÃ±es-Rodriguez,  B Gonzalez-Merino,  E. Palle,  M. Lopez-Puertas,  E. Garcia-Melendo;  Currently, the analysis of transmission spectra is the most successful technique to probe the chemical composition of exoplanet atmospheres. But the accuracy of these measurements is constrained by observational limitations and the diversity of possible atmospheric compositions. Here we show the UV-VIS-IR transmission spectrum of Jupiter, as if it were a transiting exoplanet, obtained by observing one of its satellites, Ganymede, while passing through Jupiter's shadow i.e., during a solar eclipse from Ganymede. The spectrum shows strong extinction due to the presence of clouds (aerosols) and haze in the atmosphere, and strong absorption features from CH4. More interestingly, the comparison with radiative transfer models reveals a spectral signature, which we attribute here to a Jupiter stratospheric layer of crystalline H2O ice. The atomic transitions of Na are also present. These results are relevant for the modeling and interpretation of giant transiting exoplanets. They also open a new technique to explore the atmospheric composition of the upper layers of Jupiter's atmosphere. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02315;The dynamical structure of HR 8799's inner debris disk; Bruna Contro,  Rob Wittenmyer,  Jonti Horner,  Jonathan P. Marshall;  The HR 8799 system, with its four giant planets and two debris belts, has an architecture closely mirroring that of our Solar system where the inner, warm asteroid belt and outer, cool Edgeworth-Kuiper belt bracket the giant planets. As such, it is a valuable laboratory for examining exoplanetary dynamics and debris disk-exoplanet interactions. Whilst the outer debris belt of HR 8799 has been well resolved by previous observations, the spatial extent of the inner disk remains unknown. This leaves a significant question mark over both the location of the planetesimals responsible for producing the belt's visible dust and the physical properties of those grains. We have performed the most extensive simulations to date of the inner, unresolved debris belt around HR 8799, using UNSW Australia's Katana supercomputing facility to follow the dynamical evolution of a model inner disk comprising 300,298 particles for a period of 60 million years. These simulations have enabled the characterisation of the extent and structure of the inner disk in detail, and will in future allow us to provide a first estimate of the small-body impact rate and water delivery prospects for possible (as-yet undetected) terrestrial planet(s) in the inner system. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02361;The Active Asteroids; David Jewitt,  Henry Hsieh,  Jessica Agarwal;"  Some asteroids eject dust, producing transient, comet-like comae and tails; these are the active asteroids. The causes of activity in this newly-identified population are many and varied. They include impact ejection and disruption, rotational instabilities, electrostatic repulsion, radiation pressure sweeping, dehydration stresses and thermal fracture, in addition to the sublimation of asteroidal ice. These processes were either unsuspected or thought to lie beyond the realm of observation before the discovery of asteroid activity. Scientific interest in the active asteroids lies in their promise to open new avenues into the direct study of asteroid destruction, the production of interplanetary debris, the abundance of asteroid ice and the origin of terrestrial planet volatiles.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02662;One-armed spirals in locally isothermal, radially structured  self-gravitating discs; Min-Kai Lin (Arizona);  We describe a new mechanism that leads to the destabilisation of non-axisymmetric waves in astrophysical discs with an imposed radial temperature gradient. This might apply, for example, to the outer parts of protoplanetary discs. We use linear density wave theory to show that non-axisymmetric perturbations generally do not conserve their angular momentum in the presence of a forced temperature gradient. This implies an exchange of angular momentum between linear perturbations and the background disc. In particular, when the disturbance is a low-frequency trailing wave and the disc temperature decreases outwards, this interaction is unstable and leads to the growth of the wave. We demonstrate this phenomenon through numerical hydrodynamic simulations of locally isothermal discs in 2D using the FARGO code and in 3D with the ZEUS-MP and PLUTO codes. We consider radially structured discs with a self-gravitating region which remains stable in the absence of a temperature gradient. However, when a temperature gradient is imposed we observe exponential growth of a one-armed spiral mode (azimuthal wavenumber $m=1$) with co-rotation radius outside the bulk of the spiral arm, resulting in a nearly-stationary one-armed spiral pattern. The development of this one-armed spiral does not require the movement of the central star, as found in previous studies. Because destabilisation by a forced temperature gradient does not explicitly require disc self-gravity, we suggest this mechanism may also affect low-frequency one-armed oscillations in non-self-gravitating discs. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02937;Planetary Systems and the Formation of Habitable Planets; Rudolf Dvorak,  Thomas I. Maindl,  Christoph Burger,  Christoph SchÃ¤fer,  Roland Speith;"  As part of a national scientific network 'Pathways to Habitability' the formation of planets and the delivery of water onto these planets is a key question as water is essential for the development of life. In the first part of the paper we summarize the state of the art of planet formation - which is still under debate in the astronomical community - before we show our results on this topic. The outcome of our numerical simulations depends a lot on the choice of the initial distribution of planetesimals and planetary embryos after gas disappeared in the protoplanetary disk. We also take into account that some of these planetesimals of sizes in the order of the mass of the Moon already contained water; the quantity depends on the distance from the Sun - close-by bodies are dry, but starting from a distance of about 2 AU they can contain substantial amounts of water. We assume that the gas giants and terrestrial planets are already formed when we check the collisions of the small bodies containing water (in the order of a few percent) with the terrestrial planets. We thus are able to give an estimate of the respective contribution to the actual water content (of some Earth-oceans) in the mantle, in the crust and on the surface of Earth. In the second part we discuss in more detail how the formation of larger bodies after a collision may happen as the outcome depends on parameters like collision velocity, impact angle, and the materials involved. We present results obtained by SPH (Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics) simulations. We briefly describe this method and show different scenarios with respect to the formed bodies, possible fragmentation and the water content before and after the collision. In an appendix we discuss detection methods for extrasolar planets (close to 2000 such objects have been discovered so far). ";Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Cieza,  Dimitri Mawet,  Bin Yang,  Hector Canovas,  Jos De Boer,  Simon Casassus,  Francois Menard,  Matthias R. Schreiber,  Michael C. Liu,  Beth A. Biller,  Eric L. Nielsen,  Thomas L. Hayward;  We present a new algorithm designed to improve the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of point and extended source detections in direct imaging data. The novel part of our method is that it finds the linear combination of the science images that best match counterpart images with signal removed from suspected source regions. The algorithm, based on the Locally Optimized Combination of Images (LOCI) method, is called Matched LOCI or MLOCI. We show using data obtained with the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) and Near-Infrared Coronagraphic Imager (NICI) that the new algorithm can improve the SNR of point source detections by 30-400% over past methods. We also find no increase in false detections rates. No prior knowledge of candidate companion locations is required to use MLOCI. While non-blind applications may yield linear combinations of science images which seem to increase the SNR of true sources by a factor > 2, they can also yield false detections at high rates. This is a potential pitfall when trying to confirm marginal detections or to re-detect point sources found in previous epochs. Our findings are relevant to any method where the coefficients of the linear combination are considered tunable, e.g. LOCI and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Thus we recommend that false detection rates be analyzed when using these techniques. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03189;Exploring Exogenic Sources for the Olivine on Asteroid (4) Vesta; Lucille Le Corre,  Vishnu Reddy,  Juan A. Sanchez,  Tasha Dunn,  Edward A. Cloutis,  Matthew R.M. Izawa,  Paul Mann,  Andreas Nathues;  The detection of olivine on Vesta is interesting because it may provide critical insights into planetary differentiation early in our Solar System's history. Ground-based and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of asteroid (4) Vesta have suggested the presence of olivine on the surface. These observations were reinforced by the discovery of olivine-rich HED meteorites from Vesta in recent years. However, analysis of data from NASA's Dawn spacecraft has shown that this olivine-bearing unit is actually impact melt in the ejecta of Oppia crater. The lack of widespread mantle olivine, exposed during the formation of the 19 km deep Rheasilvia basin on Vesta's South Pole, further complicated this picture. Ammannito et al., (2013a) reported the discovery of local scale olivine-rich units in the form of excavated material from the mantle using the Visible and InfraRed spectrometer (VIR) on Dawn. Here we explore alternative sources for the olivine in the northern hemisphere of Vesta by reanalyzing the data from the VIR instrument using laboratory spectral measurements of meteorites. We suggest that these olivine exposures could be explained by the delivery of olivine-rich exogenic material. Based on our spectral band parameters analysis, the lack of correlation between the location of these olivine-rich terrains and possible mantle-excavating events, and supported by observations of HED meteorites, we propose that a probable source for olivine seen in the northern hemisphere are remnants of impactors made of olivine-rich meteorites. Best match suggests these units are HED material mixed with either ordinary chondrites, or with some olivine-dominated meteorites such as R-chondrites. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Geophysics (physics.geo-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03267;Kepler-447b: a hot-Jupiter with an extremely grazing transit; J. Lillo-Box,  D. Barrado,  N. C. Santos,  L. Mancini,  P. Figueira,  S. Ciceri,  Th. Henning;  We present the radial velocity confirmation of the extrasolar planet Kepler-447b, initially detected as a candidate by the Kepler mission. In this work, we analyze its transit signal and the radial velocity data obtained with the Calar Alto Fiber-fed Echelle spectrograph (CAFE). By simultaneously modeling both datasets, we obtain the orbital and physical properties of the system. According to our results, Kepler-447b is a Jupiter-mass planet ($M_p=1.37^{+0.48}_{-0.46}~M_{\rm Jup}$), with an estimated radius of $R_p=1.65^{+0.59}_{-0.56}~R_{\rm Jup}$ (uncertainties provided in this work are $3\sigma$ unless specified). This translates into a sub-Jupiter density. The planet revolves every $\sim7.8$ days in a slightly eccentric orbit ($e=0.123^{+0.037}_{-0.036}$) around a G8V star with detected activity in the Kepler light curve. Kepler-447b transits its host with a large impact parameter ($b=1.076^{+0.112}_{-0.086}$), being one of the few planetary grazing transits confirmed so far and the first in the Kepler large crop of exoplanets. We estimate that only around 20% of the projected planet disk occults the stellar disk. The relatively large uncertainties in the planet radius are due to the large impact parameter and short duration of the transit. Planets with such an extremely large impact parameter can be used to detect and analyze interesting configurations such as additional perturbing bodies, stellar pulsations, rotation of a non-spherical planet, or polar spot-crossing events. All these scenarios would periodically modify the transit properties (depth, duration, and time of mid-transit), what could be detectable with sufficient accurate photometry. Short-cadence photometric data (at the 1 minute level) would help in the search for these exotic configurations in grazing planetary transits like that of Kepler-447b. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03270;Convection and Mixing in Giant Planet Evolution; Allona Vazan,  Ravit Helled,  Attay Kovetz,  Morris Podolak;  The primordial internal structures of gas giant planets are unknown. Often giant planets are modeled under the assumption that they are adiabatic, convective, and homogeneously mixed, but this is not necessarily correct. In this work, we present the first self-consistent calculation of convective transport of both heat and material as the planets evolve. We examine how planetary evolution depends on the initial composition and its distribution, whether the internal structure changes with time, and if so, how it affects the evolution. We consider various primordial distributions, different compositions, and different mixing efficiencies and follow the distribution of heavy elements in a Jupiter-mass planet as it evolves. We show that a heavy-element core cannot be eroded by convection if there is a sharp compositional change at the core-envelope boundary. If the heavy elements are initially distributed within the planet according to some compositional gradient, mixing occurs in the outer regions resulting in a compositionally homogeneous outer envelope. Mixing of heavy materials that are injected in a convective gaseous envelope are found to mix efficiently. Our work demonstrates that the primordial internal structure of a giant planet plays a substantial role in determining its long-term evolution and that giant planets can have non-adiabatic interiors. These results emphasize the importance of coupling formation, evolution, and internal structure models of giant planets self-consistently. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

This process is accompanied by a luminous phenomena in the atmosphere, called bolides or fireballs. Observations of bolides provide pre-atmospheric orbits of meteorites, physical and chemical properties of small asteroids, and the flux (i.e. frequency of impacts) of bodies at the Earth in the centimeter to decameter size range. In this chapter we explain the processes occurring during the penetration of cosmic bodies through the atmosphere and review the methods of bolide observations. We compile available data on the fireballs associated with 22 instrumentally observed meteorite falls. Among them are the heterogeneous falls Almahata Sitta (2008 TC$_3$) and Bene\v{s}ov, which revolutionized our view on the structure and composition of small asteroids, the P\v{r}\'{\i}bram-Neuschwanstein orbital pair, carbonaceous chondrite meteorites with orbits on the asteroid-comet boundary, and the Chelyabinsk fall, which produced a damaging blast wave.

Katherina Feng,  Tabetha Boyajian,  Jason Wright,  Debra A. Fischer,  Andrew W. Howard;  Exoplanetary systems closest to the Sun, with the brightest host stars, provide the most favorable opportunities for characterization studies of the host star and their planet(s). The Transit Ephemeris Refinement and Monitoring Survey uses both new radial velocity measurements and photometry in order to greatly improve planetary orbit uncertainties and the fundamental properties of the star, in this case HD 130322. The only companion, HD 130322b, orbits in a relatively circular orbit, e = 0.029 every ~10.7 days. Radial velocity measurements from multiple sources, including 12 unpublished from the Keck I telescope, over the course of ~14 years have reduced the uncertainty in the transit midpoint to ~2 hours. The transit probability for the b-companion is 4.7%, where M_p sin i = 1.15 M_J and a = 0.0925 AU. In this paper, we compile photometric data from the T11 0.8m Automated Photoelectric Telescope at Fairborn Observatory taken over ~14 years, including the constrained transit window, which results in a dispositive null result for both full transit exclusion of HD 130322b to a depth of 0.017 mag and grazing transit exclusion to a depth of ~0.001 mag. Our analysis of the starspot activity via the photometric data reveals a highly accurate stellar rotation period: 26.53 +/-0.70 days. In addition, the brightness of the host with respect to the comparison stars is anti-correlated with the Ca II H and K indices, typical for a young solar-type star. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

To study correctly these C-rich atmospheres, a chemical scheme adapted to this composition is necessary. We have implemented a chemical scheme that can describe the kinetics of species with up to 6 carbon atoms. This chemical scheme has been developed with specialists of combustion and validated through experiments on a wide range of T and P. This chemical network is available on the online database KIDA. We have created a grid of 12 models to explore different thermal profiles and C/O ratios. For each of them, we have compared the chemical composition determined with a C0-C2 chemical scheme (species with up to 2 carbon atoms) and with the C0-C6 scheme. We found no difference in the results obtained with the two schemes when photolyses are not included in the model, whatever the temperature of the atmosphere. In contrast, when there is photochemistry, differences can appear in the upper atmosphere. These differences are found for all the tested PT profiles in the case that the C/O ratio is above 1. When the C/O ratio of the atmosphere is solar, differences are only found at temperatures lower than 1000K. The differences linked to the use of different chemical schemes do not have important influence on the synthetic spectra. However, we have confirmed that C2H2 and HCN as possible tracers of warm C-rich atmospheres. The use of this new chemical scheme is mandatory to model atmospheres with a high C/O ratio and, in particular, if one is interested in studying in details the photochemistry. If one is just interested in the synthetic spectra, the use of a smaller scheme may be sufficient. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Connolly,  Willy Benz,  Paul Tackley;"  We present an inversion method based on Bayesian analysis to constrain the interior structure of terrestrial exoplanets, in the form of chemical composition of the mantle and core size. Specifically, we identify what parts of the interior structure of terrestrial exoplanets can be determined from observations of mass, radius, and stellar elemental abundances. We perform a full probabilistic inverse analysis to formally account for observational and model uncertainties and obtain confidence regions of interior structure models. This enables us to characterize how model variability depends on data and associated uncertainties. We test our method on terrestrial solar system planets and find that our model predictions are consistent with independent estimates. Furthermore, we apply our method to synthetic exoplanets up to 10 Earth masses and up to 1.7 Earth radii as well as to exoplanet Kepler-36b. Importantly, the inversion strategy proposed here provides a framework for understanding the level of precision required to characterize the interior of exoplanets. Our main conclusions are: (1) observations of mass and radius are sufficient to constrain core size; (2) stellar elemental abundances (Fe, Si, Mg) are key constraints to reduce degeneracy in interior structure models and to constrain mantle composition; (3) the inherent degeneracy in determining interior structure from mass and radius observations does not only depend on measurement accuracies but also on the actual size and density of the exoplanet. We argue that precise observations of stellar elemental abundances are central in order to place constraints on planetary bulk composition and to reduce model degeneracy.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03852;Earth and Terrestrial Planet Formation; Seth A. Jacobson,  Kevin J. Walsh;  The growth and composition of Earth is a direct consequence of planet formation throughout the Solar System. We discuss the known history of the Solar System, the proposed stages of growth and how the early stages of planet formation may be dominated by pebble growth processes. Pebbles are small bodies whose strong interactions with the nebula gas lead to remarkable new accretion mechanisms for the formation of planetesimals and the growth of planetary embryos. Many of the popular models for the later stages of planet formation are presented. The classical models with the giant planets on fixed orbits are not consistent with the known history of the Solar System, fail to create a high Earth/Mars mass ratio, and, in many cases, are also internally inconsistent. The successful Grand Tack model creates a small Mars, a wet Earth, a realistic asteroid belt and the mass-orbit structure of the terrestrial planets. In the Grand Tack scenario, growth curves for Earth most closely match a Weibull model. The feeding zones, which determine the compositions of Earth and Venus follow a particular pattern determined by Jupiter, while the feeding zones of Mars and Theia, the last giant impactor on Earth, appear to randomly sample the terrestrial disk. The late accreted mass samples the disk nearly evenly. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Durda,  Martin Jutzi,  Erik Asphaug;  In the last decade, thanks to the development of sophisticated numerical codes, major breakthroughs have been achieved in our understanding of the formation of asteroid families by catastrophic disruption of large parent bodies. In this review, we describe numerical simulations of asteroid collisions that reproduced the main properties of families, accounting for both the fragmentation of an asteroid at the time of impact and the subsequent gravitational interactions of the generated fragments. The simulations demonstrate that the catastrophic disruption of bodies larger than a few hundred meters in diameter leads to the formation of large aggregates due to gravitational reaccumulation of smaller fragments, which helps explain the presence of large members within asteroid families. Thus, for the first time, numerical simulations successfully reproduced the sizes and ejection velocities of members of representative families. Moreover, the simulations provide constraints on the family dynamical histories and on the possible internal structure of family members and their parent bodies. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Colors provide limited information but remain the best tool to study the bulk surface properties. We explore recurrent effects in the study of visible colors: i) how a correlation could be missed or weakened as a result of the data error bars, ii) the ""risk"" of missing an existing trend because of low sampling, and the possibility of making quantified predictions on the sample size needed to detect a trend at a given significance level, iii) the use of partial correlations to distinguish the mutual effect of two or more parameters, and iv) the sensitivity of the ""reddening line"" tool to the central wavelength of the filters used. We have compiled the visible colors of about 370 objects available in the literature and carried out an analysis per dynamical family. Our results show how a) data error bars impose a limit on the detectable correlations regardless of sample size and that therefore, once that limit is achieved, it is important to diminish the error bars, but it is pointless to enlarge the sampling with the same or larger errors; b) almost all dynamical families still require larger samplings to ensure the detection of correlations stronger than 0.5; c) the correlation strength between (V-R) vs. (R-I) is systematically lower than the one between (B-V) vs. (V-R) and is not related with error-bar differences between these colors; d) it is statistically equivalent to use any of the different flavors of orbital excitation or collisional velocity parameters regarding the color-inclination correlation of classical KBOs whereas the inclination and Tisserand parameter relative to Neptune cannot be separated from one another; and e) classical KBOs are the only dynamical family that shows neither (B-V) vs. (V-R) nor (V-R) vs. (R-I) correlations.

We use the symplectic integrator SyMBA to numerically integrate the orbits of planets for 100 Ma, using populations from previous studies as initial conditions.We show that within the populations studied, mass and semi-major axis distributions experience only minor changes from post-formation evolution. We also show that, depending upon their initial distribution, planetary eccentricities can statistically increase or decrease as a result of gravitational interactions. We find that planetary masses and orbital spacings provided by planet formation models do not result in eccentricity distributions comparable to observed exoplanet eccentricities, requiring other phenomena such as e.g. stellar fly-bys to account for observed eccentricities. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Qiu,  X. M. Meng,  H. B. Cai,  L. Cao,  J. S. Deng,  X. H. Han,  J. Y. Wei;  The content of $\mathrm{OH/H_2O}$ molecules in the tenuous exosphere of the Moon is still an open issue at present. We here report an unprecedented upper limit of the content of the OH radicals, which is obtained from the in-situ measurements carried out \rm by the Lunar-based Ultraviolet Telescope, a payload of Chinese Chang'e-3 mission. By analyzing the diffuse background in the images taken by the telescope, the column density and surface concentration of the OH radicals are inferred to be $<10^{11}\ \mathrm{cm^{-2}}$ and $<10^{4}\ \mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ (by assuming a hydrostatic equilibrium with a scale height of 100km), respectively, by assuming that the recorded background is fully contributed by their resonance fluorescence emission. The resulted concentration is lower than the previously reported value by about two orders of magnitude, and is close to the prediction of the sputtering model. In addition, the same measurements and method allow us to derive a surface concentration of $<10^{2}\ \mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ for the neutral magnesium, which is lower than the previously reported upper limit by about two orders of magnitude. These results are the best known of the OH (MgI) content in the lunar exosphere to date. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Space Physics (physics.space-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04410;Detecting the oldest geodynamo and attendant shielding from the solar  wind: Implications for habitability; John A. Tarduno,  Eric G. Blackman,  Eric E. Mamajek;  The onset and nature of the earliest geomagnetic field is important for understanding the evolution of the core, atmosphere and life on Earth. A record of the early geodynamo is preserved in ancient silicate crystals containing minute magnetic inclusions. These data indicate the presence of a geodynamo during the Paleoarchean, between 3.4 and 3.45 billion years ago. While the magnetic field sheltered Earth's atmosphere from erosion at this time, standoff of the solar wind was greatly reduced, and similar to that during modern extreme solar storms. These conditions suggest that intense radiation from the young Sun may have modified the atmosphere of the young Earth by promoting loss of volatiles, including water. Such effects would have been more pronounced if the field were absent or very weak prior to 3.45 billion years ago, as suggested by some models of lower mantle evolution. The frontier is thus trying to obtain geomagnetic field records that are >>3.45 billion-years-old, as well as constraining solar wind pressure for these times. In this review we suggest pathways for constraining these parameters and the attendant history of Earth's deep interior, hydrosphere and atmosphere. In particular, we discuss new estimates for solar wind pressure for the first 700 million years of Earth history, the competing effects of magnetic shielding versus solar ion collection, and bounds on the detection level of a geodynamo imposed by the presence of external fields. We also discuss the prospects for constraining Hadean-Paleoarchean magnetic field strength using paleointensity analyses of zircons. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

The self-diffusion is largely higher and the shear viscosity is notably lower predicted with the quantum mechanical description of the nuclear motion compared with the description by Newton equation. The results show that nuclear quantum effects (NQEs), which depends on the temperature and density of the matter via the thermal de Broglie wavelength and the ionization of electrons, are essential for the transport properties of dense liquid helium at certain astrophysical conditions. The Stokes-Einstein relation between diffusion and viscosity in strongly coupled regime is also examined to display the influences of NQEs. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Disordered Systems and Neural Networks (cond-mat.dis-nn); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)"

Littlefair;"  We present simultaneous multi-color optical photometry using ULTRACAM of the transiting exoplanet KIC 12557548 b (also known as KIC 1255 b). This reveals, for the first time, the color dependence of the transit depth. Our g and z transits are similar in shape to the average Kepler short-cadence profile, and constitute the highest-quality extant coverage of individual transits. Our Night 1 transit depths are 0.85 +/- 0.04% in z; 1.00 +/- 0.03% in g; and 1.1 +/- 0.3% in u. We employ a residual-permutation method to assess the impact of correlated noise on the depth difference between the z and g bands and calculate the significance of the color dependence at 3.2{\sigma}. The Night 1 depths are consistent with dust extinction as observed in the ISM, but require grain sizes comparable to the largest found in the ISM: 0.25-1{\mu}m. This provides direct evidence in favor of this object being a disrupting low-mass rocky planet, feeding a transiting dust cloud. On the remaining four nights of observations the object was in a rare shallow-transit phase. If the grain size in the transiting dust cloud changes as the transit depth changes, the extinction efficiency is expected to change in a wavelength- and composition-dependent way. Observing a change in the wavelength-dependent transit depth would offer an unprecedented opportunity to determine the composition of the disintegrating rocky body KIC 12557548 b. We detected four out-of-transit u band events consistent with stellar flares. ";Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

We apply high-resolution (R = 100 000) infrared spectroscopy to probe the temperature-pressure profile of HD 209458 b. This bright, transiting hot-Jupiter has long been considered the gold standard for a hot Jupiter with an inversion layer, but this has been challenged in recent publications. We observed the thermal dayside emission of HD 209458 b with CRIRES / VLT during three nights, targeting the carbon monoxide band at 2.3 microns. Thermal inversions give rise to emission features, which means that detecting emission lines in the planetary spectrum, as opposed to absorption lines, would be direct evidence of a region in which the temperature increases with altitude. We do not detect any significant absorption or emission of CO in the dayside spectrum of HD 209458 b, although cross-correlation with template spectra either with CO absorption lines or with weak emission at the core of the lines show a low-significance correlation signal with a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 - 3.5. Models with strong CO emission lines show a weak anti-correlation with similar or lower significance levels. Furthermore, we found no evidence of absorption or emission from H2O at these wavelengths. The non-detection of CO in the dayside spectrum of HD 209458 b is interesting in light of a previous CO detection in the transmission spectrum. That there is no signal indicates that HD 209458 b either has a nearly isothermal atmosphere or that the signal is heavily muted. Assuming a clear atmosphere, we can rule out a full-disc dayside inversion layer in the pressure range 1 bar to 1 mbar. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

We present a method for searching K2 light curves for evidence of exoplanets by simultaneously fitting for these systematics and the transit signals of interest. This method is more computationally expensive than standard search algorithms but we demonstrate that it can be efficiently implemented and used to discover transit signals. We apply this method to the full Campaign 1 dataset and report a list of 36 planet candidates transiting 31 stars, along with an analysis of the pipeline performance and detection efficiency based on artificial signal injections and recoveries. For all planet candidates, we present posterior distributions on the properties of each system based strictly on the transit observables. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04747;Orbital instability of close-in exomoons in non-coplanar systems; Yu-Cian Hong,  Matthew S. Tiscareno,  Philip D. Nicholson,  Jonathan I. Lunine;  This work shows the dynamical instability that can happen to close-in satellites when planet oblateness is not accounted for in non-coplanar multiplanet systems. Simulations include two secularly interacting Jupiter-mass planets mutually inclined by 10 degrees, with the host planet either oblate or spherical. With a spherical host planet, moons within a critical planetocentric distance experience high inclinations and in some cases high eccentricities, while more distant moons orbit stably with low inclinations and eccentricities, as expected. These counter-intuitive dynamical phenomena disappear with an oblate host planet, in which case the moons' Laplace plane transitions from the host planet's equatorial plane to the host planet's precessing orbital plane as their semi-major axes increase, and all moons are dynamically stable with very mild changes in orbits. Direct perturbation from the perturbing planet has been investigated and ruled out as an explanation for the behavior of the innermost satellites, therefore leaving the central star's perturbation as the cause. Instability occurs while the nodal precession of the satellite and the central star (as seen from the host planet's frame) approaches the 1:1 secular resonance. In non-coplanar systems, around a non-oblate planet, the nodal precession of the moon becomes slow and comparable to that of the planet, giving rise to resonant configurations. The above effect needs to be taken into account in setting up numerical simulations. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Viikinkoski;  In the past decade, hundreds of asteroid shape models have been derived using the lightcurve inversion method. At the same time, a new framework of 3-D shape modeling based on the combined analysis of widely different data sources such as optical lightcurves, disk-resolved images, stellar occultation timings, mid-infrared thermal radiometry, optical interferometry, and radar delay-Doppler data, has been developed. This multi-data approach allows the determination of most of the physical and surface properties of asteroids in a single, coherent inversion, with spectacular results. We review the main results of asteroid lightcurve inversion and also recent advances in multi-data modeling. We show that models based on remote sensing data were confirmed by spacecraft encounters with asteroids, and we discuss how the multiplication of highly detailed 3-D models will help to refine our general knowledge of the asteroid population. The physical and surface properties of asteroids, i.e., their spin, 3-D shape, density, thermal inertia, surface roughness, are among the least known of all asteroid properties. Apart for the albedo and diameter, we have access to the whole picture for only a few hundreds of asteroids. These quantities are nevertheless very important to understand as they affect the non-gravitational Yarkovsky effect responsible for meteorite delivery to Earth, or the bulk composition and internal structure of asteroids. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

(2013). Using detailed computation we confirm that the orbit of the Chelyabinsk impactor is anomalously close to 1999 NC43. We find about (1-3) x 10-4 likelihood of that to happen by chance. Taking the standpoint that the Chelyabinsk impactor indeed separated from 1999 NC43 by a cratering or rotational fission event, we run a forward probability calculation, which is an independent statistical test. However, we find this scenario is unlikely at the about (10-3 -10-2) level. We also verified compositional link between Chelyabinska and 1999NC43. Mineralogical analysis of Chelyabinsk (LL chondrite) and (8) Flora (the largest member of the presumed LL chondrite parent family) shows that their olivine and pyroxene chemistries are similar to LL chondrites. Similar analysis of 1999 NC43 shows that its olivine and pyroxene chemistries are more similar to L chondrites than LL chondrites (like Chelyabinsk). We also took photometric observations of 1999 NC43 over 54 nights during two apparitions (2000, 2014). The lightcurve of 1999 NC43 resembles simulated lightcurves of tumblers in Short-Axis Mode with the mean wobbling angle 20-30 deg. While, a mechanism of the non-principal axis rotation excitation is unclear, we can rule out the formation of asteroid in disruption of its parent body as a plausible cause, as it is unlikely that the rotation of an asteroid fragment from catastrophic disruption would be nearly completely halted. Considering all these facts, we find the proposed link between the Chelyabinsk meteoroid and the asteroid 1999 NC43 to be unlikely. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)"

This has enabled the accurate identification of several meteorite parent bodies in the main asteroid belt and helped constrain the mineral chemistries and abundances in ordinary chondrites and basaltic achondrites. With better quantification of spectral effects due to temperature, phase angle, and grain size, systematic discrepancies due to non-compositional factors can now be virtually eliminated for mafic silicate-bearing asteroids. Interpretation of spectrally featureless asteroids remains a challenge.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05011;The Mass Distribution Function of Planets; Renu Malhotra;  The distribution of orbital period ratios of adjacent planets in extra-solar planetary systems discovered by the {\it Kepler} space telescope exhibits a peak near $\sim1.5$--$2$, a long tail of larger period ratios, and a steep drop-off in the number of systems with period ratios below $\sim1.5$. We find from this data that the dimensionless orbital separations have an approximately log-normal distribution. Using Hill's criterion for the dynamical stability of two planets, we find an upper bound on planet masses such that the most common planet mass does not exceed $10^{-3.2}m_*$, or about two-thirds Jupiter mass for solar mass stars. Assuming that the mass ratio and the dynamical separation (orbital spacings in units of mutual Hill radius) of adjacent planets are independent random variates, and adopting empirical distributions for these, we use Hill's criterion in a statistical way to estimate the planet mass distribution function from the observed distribution of orbital separations. We find that the planet mass function is peaked in logarithm of mass, with a peak value and standard deviation of $\log m/M_\oplus$ of $\sim(0.6-1.0)$ and $\sim(1.1-1.2)$, respectively. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

We test a recently developed method for exomoon search, the orbital sampling effect (OSE), using the full exoplanet photometry from the Kepler Space Telescope. The OSE is applied to phase-folded transits, for which we present a framework to detect false positives, and discuss four candidates which pass several of our tests. Using numerical simulations, we inject exomoon signals into real Kepler data and retrieve them, showing that under favorable conditions, exomoons can be found with Kepler and the OSE method. In addition, we super-stack a large sample of Kepler planets to search for the average exomoon OSE and the accompanying increase in noise, the scatter peak. We find a significant OSE-like signal, which might indicate the presence of moons, for planets with 35d<P<80d, having an average dip per planet of 6+-2ppm, corresponding to a moon radius of 2120 +330 -370km for the average star radius of 1.24R_Sun in this sample. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

We present motivation and survey design for an ongoing project with the SDSS-III multiplexed APOGEE near-infrared spectrograph to monitor hundreds of KOI host stars. We report some of our first results using representative targets from our sample, which include current planet candidates that we find to be false positives, as well as candidates listed as false positives that we do not find to be spectroscopic binaries. With this survey, KOI hosts are observed over ~20 epochs at a radial velocity precision of 100-200 m/s. These observations can easily identify a majority of false positives caused by physically-associated stellar or substellar binaries, and in many cases, fully characterize their orbits. We demonstrate that APOGEE is capable of achieving RV precision at the 100-200 m/s level over long time baselines, and that APOGEE's multiplexing capability makes it substantially more efficient at identifying false positives due to binaries than other single-object spectrographs working to confirm KOIs as planets. These APOGEE RVs enable ancillary science projects, such as studies of fundamental stellar astrophysics or intrinsically rare substellar companions. The coadded APOGEE spectra can be used to derive stellar properties (T_eff, log(g)) and chemical abundances of over a dozen elements to probe correlations of planet properties with individual elemental abundances. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)"

Tuthill;  T Chamaeleontis is a young star surrounded by a transitional disk, and a plausible candidate for ongoing planet formation. Recently, a substellar companion candidate was reported within the disk gap of this star. However, its existence remains controversial, with the counter-hypothesis that light from a high inclination disk may also be consistent with the observed data. The aim of this work is to investigate the origin of the observed closure phase signal to determine if it is best explained by a compact companion. We observed T Cha in the L and K s filters with sparse aperture masking, with 7 datasets covering a period of 3 years. A consistent closure phase signal is recovered in all L and K s datasets. Data were fit with a companion model and an inclined circumstellar disk model based on known disk parameters: both were shown to provide an adequate fit. However, the absence of expected relative motion for an orbiting body over the 3-year time baseline spanned by the observations rules out the companion model. Applying image reconstruction techniques to each dataset reveals a stationary structure consistent with forward scattering from the near edge of an inclined disk. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Triaud,  Kristen Menou,  Hanno Rein;  A recent ALMA image revealed several concentric gaps in the protoplanetary disk surrounding the young star HL Tau. We consider the hypothesis that these gaps are carved by planets, and present a general framework for understanding the dynamical stability of such systems over typical disk lifetimes, providing estimates for the maximum planetary masses. We collect these easily evaluated constraints into a workflow that can help guide the design and interpretation of new observational campaigns and numerical simulations of gap opening in such systems. We argue that the locations of resonances should be significantly shifted in massive disks like HL Tau, and that theoretical uncertainties in the exact offset, together with observational errors, imply a large uncertainty in the dynamical state and stability in such disks. This presents an important barrier to using systems like HL Tau as a proxy for the initial conditions following planet formation. An important observational avenue to breaking this degeneracy is to search for eccentric gaps, which could implicate resonantly interacting planets. Unfortunately, massive disks like HL Tau should induce swift pericenter precession that would smear out any such eccentric features of planetary origin. This motivates pushing toward more typical, less massive disks. For a nominal non-resonant model of the HL Tau system with five planets, we find a maximum mass for the outer three bodies of approximately 2 Neptune masses. In a resonant configuration, these planets can reach at least the mass of Saturn. The inner two planets' masses are unconstrained by dynamical stability arguments. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)"

Using the new extreme-AO instrument SPHERE, we image the prototype eclipsing post-common envelope binary V471 Tau in search of the brown dwarf that is believed to be responsible for variations in its eclipse arrival times. We report that an unprecedented contrast of 12.1 magnitudes in the H band at a separation of 260 mas was achieved, but resulted in a non-detection. This implies that there is no brown dwarf present in the system unless it is three magnitudes fainter than predicted by evolutionary track models, and provides damaging evidence against the circumbinary interpretation of eclipse timing variations. In the case of V471 Tau, a more consistent explanation is offered with the Applegate mechanism, in which these variations are prescribed to changes in the quadrupole moment within the main-sequence star ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)"

We use a new method to determine these jitter components, considering them as a second and third signals in the system. A discussion on possible magnetic star-planet-interaction is included, based on the Bayesian analysis of the activity indices. We propose two possible sources for flare events of this star: one related to the geometry of the system and the relative movement of the star+planet, and a second one purely stochastic source that is related to the evolution of stellar active regions. Also, we observe for the first time the magnetic field of the star, from spectropolarimetric data. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)"

Greaves,  J. A. Raven,  C. S. Cockell;  Earth will become uninhabitable within 2-3 Gyr as a result of the moving boundaries of the habitable zone caused by the increasing luminosity of the Sun. Predictions about the future of habitable conditions on Earth include a decline in species diversity and habitat extent, ocean loss and changes in the magnitudes of geochemical cycles. However, testing these predictions on the present-day Earth is difficult. The discovery of a planet that is a near analogue to the far future Earth could provide a means to test these predictions. Such a planet would need to have an Earth-like biosphere history, requiring it to have been in its system's habitable zone (HZ) for Gyr-long periods during the system's past, and to be approaching the inner-edge of the HZ at present. Here we assess the possibility of finding this very specific type of exoplanet and discuss the benefits of analysing older Earths in terms of improving our understanding of long-term geological and bio-geological processes. As an illustrative example, G stars within 10 parsecs are assessed as potential old-Earth-analogue hosts. Surface temperature estimates for hypothetical inner-HZ Earth analogues are used to determine whether any such planets in these systems would be at the right stage in their late-habitable lifetimes to exhibit detectable biosignatures. Predictions from planet formation studies and biosphere evolution models suggest that only 0.36% of G stars in the solar neighbourhood could host an old-Earth-analogue. However, if the development of an Earth-like biosphere is assumed to be rare, requiring a sequence of low-probability events to occur, then such planets are unlikely to be found in the solar neighbourhood - although 1000s could be present in the galaxy as a whole. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

These putative planets would interact with the remnant circumstellar disk, accreting gas and generating substantial luminosity. Here I explore the expected appearance of accreting protoplanets at a range of evolutionary states. I compare synthetic spectral energy distributions with the handful of claimed detections of substellar-mass companions in transition disks. While observed fluxes of candidate companions are generally compatible with accreting protoplanets, challenges remain in reconciling the extended structure inferred in observed objects with the compact emission expected from protoplanets or circumplanetary disks. I argue that a large fraction of transition disks should harbor bright protoplanets, and that more may be detected as larger telescopes open up additional parameter space. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05449;Spacing of Kepler Planets: Sculpting by Dynamical Instability; Bonan Pu,  Yanqin Wu (Toronto);  We study the orbital architecture of multi-planet systems detected by the Kepler transit mission using N-body simulations, focusing on the orbital spacing between adjacent planets in systems showing four or more transiting planets. We find that the observed spacings are tightly clustered around 12 mutual Hill radii, when transit geometry and sensitivity limits are accounted for. In comparison, dynamical integrations reveal that the minimum spacing required for systems of similar masses to survive dynamical instability for as long as a billion years is, ~10 if all orbits are circular and coplanar, and ~12 if planetary orbits have eccentricities ~0.02 (a value suggested by studies of planet transit-time-variations). This apparent coincidence, between the observed spacing and the theoretical stability threshold, leads us to propose that typical planetary systems were formed with even tighter spacing, but most, except for the widest ones, have undergone dynamical instability, and are pared down to a more anemic version of their former selves, with fewer planets and larger spacings. So while the high multiple systems (five or more transiting planets) are primordial systems that remain stable, the single or double planetary systems, abundantly discovered by the Kepler mission, may be the descendants of more closely packed high multiple systems. If this hypothesis is correct, we infer that the formation environment of Kepler systems should be different from that of the terrestrial planets. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

The polar flattening is predicted to affect the magnetosheath magnetic field structure and thus the solar wind-magnetosphere interaction. Here we investigate the magnetic field in the magnetosheath with the expectation that polar flattening is manifested in the overall draping pattern. We compare an accumulation of Cassini data between 2004 and 2010 with global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations and an analytical model representative of a draped field between axisymmetric boundaries. The draping patterns measured are well captured and in broad agreement for given upstream conditions with those of the MHD simulations (which include polar flattening). The deviations from the analytical model, based on no polar flattening, suggest that non-axisymmetry is invariably a key feature of the magnetosphere's global structure. Our results show a comprehensive overview of the configuration of the magnetic field in a non-axisymmetric magnetosheath as revealed by Cassini. We anticipate our assessment to provide an insight to this barely studied interface between a high Alfv\'enic bow shock and a dynamic magnetosphere. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Space Physics (physics.space-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05518;On the accuracy of close stellar approaches determination; Piotr A. DybczyÅski,  Filip Berski;  The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the accuracy of our knowledge of close stellar passage distances in the pre-GAIA era.We used the most precise astrometric and kinematic data available at the moment and prepared a list of 40 stars nominally passing (in the past or future) closer than 2 pc from the Sun.We used a full gravitational potential of the Galaxy to calculate the motion of the Sun and a star from their current positions to the proximity epoch. For this calculations we used a numerical integration in rectangular, Galactocentric coordinates. We showed that in many cases the numerical integration of the star motion gives significantly different results than popular rectilinear approximation.We found several new stellar candidates for close visitors in past or in future. We used a covariance matrices of the astrometric data for each star to estimate the accuracy of the obtained proximity distance and epoch. To this aim we used a Monte Carlo method, replaced each star with 10 000 of its clones and studied the distribution of their individual close passages near the Sun. We showed that for contemporary close neighbours the precision is quite good but for more distant stars it strongly depends on the quality of astrometric and kinematic data. Several examples are discussed in detail, among them the case of HIP 14473. For this star we obtained the nominal proximity distance as small as 0.22 pc 3.78 Myr ago. However there exist strong need for more precise astrometry of this star since the proximity point uncertainty is unacceptably large. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05611;Low 60Fe abundance in Semarkona and Sahara 99555; Haolan Tang,  Nicolas Dauphas;  Iron-60 (t1/2=2.62 Myr) is a short-lived nuclide that can help constrain the astrophysical context of solar system formation and date early solar system events. A high abundance of 60Fe (60Fe/56Fe= 4x10-7) was reported by in situ techniques in some chondrules from the LL3.00 Semarkona meteorite, which was taken as evidence that a supernova exploded in the vicinity of the birthplace of the Sun. However, our previous MC-ICPMS measurements of a wide range of meteoritic materials, including chondrules, showed that 60Fe was present in the early solar system at a much lower level (60Fe/56Fe=10-8). The reason for the discrepancy is unknown but only two Semarkona chondrules were measured by MC-ICPMS and these had Fe/Ni ratios below ~2x chondritic. Here, we show that the initial 60Fe/56Fe ratio in Semarkona chondrules with Fe/Ni ratios up to ~24x chondritic is 5.4x10-9. We also establish the initial 60Fe/56Fe ratio at the time of crystallization of the Sahara 99555 angrite, a chronological anchor, to be 1.97x10-9. These results demonstrate that the initial abundance of 60Fe at solar system birth was low, corresponding to an initial 60Fe/56Fe ratio of 1.01x10-8. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05620;Detection and characterization of Io's atmosphere from high-resolution  4-Î¼m spectroscopy; E. Lellouch,  M. Ali-Dib,  K.-L. Jessup,  A. Smette,  H.-U. KÃ¤ufl,  F. Marchis;  We report on high-resolution and spatially-resolved spectra of Io in the 4.0 {\mu}m region, recorded with the VLT/CRIRES instrument in 2008 and 2010, which provide the first detection of the {\nu}1 + {\nu}3 band of SO2 in Io's atmosphere. Data are analyzed to constrain the latitudinal, longitudinal, and diurnal distribution of Io's SO2 atmosphere as well as its characteristic temperature. equatorial SO2 column densities clearly show longitudinal asymmetry, but with a maximum of around 1.5e17 cm-2 at central meridian longitude L = 200-220 and a minimum of around 3e16 cm-2 at L = 285-300, the longitudinal pattern somewhat differs from earlier inferences from Ly {\alpha} and thermal IR measurements. Within the accuracy of the measurements, no evolution of the atmospheric density from mid-2008 to mid-2010 can be distinguished. The decrease of the SO2 column density towards high latitude is apparent, and the typical latitudinal extent of the atmosphere found to be (+-) 40{\deg} at half-maximum. The data show moderate diurnal variations of the equatorial atmosphere, which is evidence for a partially sublimation-supported atmospheric component. Compared to local noon, factor of 2 lower densities are observed around 40{\deg} before and 80{\deg} after noon. Best-fit gas temperatures range from 150 to 220 K, with a weighted mean value of 170 (+-) 20 K, which should represent the column-weighted mean kinetic temperature of Io's atmosphere. Finally, although the data include clear thermal emission due to Pillan (in outburst in July 2008) and Loki, no detectable enhancements in the SO2 atmosphere above these volcanic regions are found, with an upper limit of 4e16 cm-2 at Pillan and 1e17 cm-2 at Loki. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

";  The discovery of almost 2000 exoplanets has revealed an unexpectedly diverse planet population. Observations to date have shown that our Solar System is certainly not representative of the general population of planets in our Milky Way. The key science questions that urgently need addressing are therefore: What are exoplanets made of? Why are planets as they are? What causes the exceptional diversity observed as compared to the Solar System? EChO (Exoplanet Characterisation Observatory) has been designed as a dedicated survey mission for transit and eclipse spectroscopy capable of observing a large and diverse planet sample within its four-year mission lifetime. EChO can target the atmospheres of super-Earths, Neptune-like, and Jupiter-like planets, in the very hot to temperate zones (planet temperatures of 300K-3000K) of F to M-type host stars. Over the next ten years, several new ground- and space-based transit surveys will come on-line (e.g. NGTS, CHEOPS, TESS, PLATO), which will specifically focus on finding bright, nearby systems. The current rapid rate of discovery would allow the target list to be further optimised in the years prior to EChO's launch and enable the atmospheric characterisation of hundreds of planets. Placing the satellite at L2 provides a cold and stable thermal environment, as well as a large field of regard to allow efficient time-critical observation of targets randomly distributed over the sky. A 1m class telescope is sufficiently large to achieve the necessary spectro-photometric precision. The spectral coverage (0.5-11 micron, goal 16 micron) and SNR to be achieved by EChO, thanks to its high stability and dedicated design, would enable a very accurate measurement of the atmospheric composition and structure of hundreds of exoplanets. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05781;An Unbiased Near-infrared Interferometric Survey for Hot Exozodiacal  Dust; Steve Ertel,  Jean-Charles Augereau,  Olivier Absil,  Denis DefrÃ¨re,  Jean-Baptiste LeBouquin,  Lindsay Marion,  Amy Bonsor,  JÃ©rÃ©my Lebreton;  Exozodiacal dust is warm or hot dust found in the inner regions of planetary systems orbiting main sequence stars, in or around their habitable zones. The dust can be the most luminous component of extrasolar planetary systems, but predominantly emits in the near- to mid-infrared where it is outshone by the host star. Interferometry provides a unique method of separating this dusty emission from the stellar emission. The visitor instrument PIONIER at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) has been used to search for hot exozodiacal dust around a large sample of nearby main sequence stars. The results of this survey are summarised: 9 out of 85 stars show excess exozodiacal emission over the stellar photospheric emission. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05893;Saturn's Great Storm of 2010-2011: Evidence for ammonia and water ices  from analysis of VIMS spectra; Lawrence Sromovsky,  Kevin Baines,  Patrick Fry;  Our analysis of Cassini/VIMS near-infrared spectra of Saturn's Great Storm of 2010-2011 reveals a multi-component aerosol composition comprised primarily of ammonia ice, with a significant component of water ice. The most likely third component is ammonium hydrosulfide or some weakly absorbing material similar to what dominates visible clouds outside the storm region. Horizontally heterogeneous models favor ammonium hydrosulfide as the third component, while horizontally uniform models favor the weak absorber. Both models rely on water ice absorption to compensate for residual spectral gradients produced by ammonia ice from 3.0 microns to 3.1 microns and need the third component to fill in the sharp ammonia ice absorption peak near 2.96 microns. The best heterogeneous model has spatial coverage fractions of 55% ammonia ice, 22% water ice, and 23% ammonium hydrosulfide. The best homogeneous model has an optically thin layer of weakly absorbing particles above an optically thick layer of water ice particles coated by ammonia ice. This is the first spectroscopic evidence of water ice in Saturn's atmosphere, found near the level of Saturn's visible cloud deck where it could only be delivered by powerful convection originating from ~200 km deeper in the atmosphere. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Madiedo;  By using an array of high-sensitivity CCD video devices and spectrographs, the activity of meteor events from the poorly-known $\rho$-Geminid meteoroid stream has been monitored during January 2012 and 2013. As a result of this research, the atmospheric trajectory and radiant position of 10 of these events has been obtained, but also the orbital parameters of the progenitor meteoroids and the tensile strength of these particles. The data reveal that the progenitor of this stream must be a comet. In addition, the emission spectra produced by three $\rho$-Geminid meteors were also recorded. These are the first $\rho$-Geminid spectra discussed in the scientific literature, and have provided clues about the chemical nature of these meteoroids and their parent body. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Buratti,  Driss Takir,  Beth Ellen Clark;  Asteroid photometry has three major applications: providing clues about asteroid surface physical properties and compositions, facilitating photometric corrections, and helping design and plan ground-based and spacecraft observations. The most significant advances in asteroid photometry in the past decade were driven by spacecraft observations that collected spatially resolved imaging and spectroscopy data. In the mean time, laboratory measurements and theoretical developments are revealing controversies regarding the physical interpretations of models and model parameter values. We will review the new developments in asteroid photometry that have occurred over the past decade in the three complementary areas of observations, laboratory work, and theory. Finally we will summarize and discuss the implications of recent findings. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.06387;Analytic orbit propagation for transiting circumbinary planets; Nikolaos Georgakarakos,  Siegfried Eggl;  The herein presented analytical framework fully describes the motion of coplanar systems consisting of a stellar binary and a planet orbiting both stars on orbital as well as secular timescales. Perturbations of the Runge-Lenz vector are used to derive short period evolution of the system, while octupole secular theory is applied to describe its long term behaviour. A post Newtonian correction on the stellar orbit is included. The planetary orbit is initially circular and the theory developed here assumes that the planetary eccentricity remains relatively small (e_2<0.2). Our model is tested against results from numerical integrations of the full equations of motion and is then applied to investigate the dynamical history of some of the circumbinary planetary systems discovered by NASA's Kepler satellite. Our results suggest that the formation history of the systems Kepler-34 and Kepler-413 has most likely been different from the one of Kepler-16, Kepler-35, Kepler-38 and Kepler-64, since the observed planetary eccentricities for those systems are not compatible with the assumption of initially circular orbits. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

However, in the time since the publication of Asteroids III, evolution of astronomical instrumentation, laboratory capabilities, and theoretical models have led to great advances in our understanding of H2O/OH on small bodies, and spacecraft observations of the Moon and Vesta have important implications for our interpretations of the asteroidal population. We begin this chapter with the importance of water/OH in asteroids, after which we will discuss their spectral features throughout the visible and near-infrared. We continue with an overview of the findings in meteorites and asteroids, closing with a discussion of future opportunities, the results from which we can anticipate finding in Asteroids V. Because this topic is of broad importance to asteroids, we also point to relevant in-depth discussions elsewhere in this volume. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.06480;Methane depletion in both polar regions of Uranus inferred from HST/STIS  and Keck/NIRC2 observations; Lawrence Sromovsky,  Erich Karkoschka,  Patrick Fry,  Heidi Hammel,  Imke de Pater,  Kathy Rages;  From STIS observations of Uranus in 2012, we found that the methane volume mixing ratio declined from about 4% at low latitudes to about 2% at 60 deg N and beyond. This is similar to that found in the south polar regions in 2002, in spite of what appears to be strikingly different convective activity in the two regions. Keck and HST imaging observations close to equinox imply that the depletions were simultaneously present in 2007, suggesting they are persistent features. The depletions appear to be mainly restricted to the upper troposphere, with depth increasing poleward from about 30 deg N, reaching ~4 bars at 45 deg N and perhaps much deeper at 70 deg N. The latitudinal variations in degree and depth of the depletions are important constraints on models of meridional circulation. Our observations are qualitatively consistent with previously suggested circulation cells in which rising methane-rich gas at low latitudes is dried out by condensation and sedimentation of methane ice particles as the gas ascends to altitudes above the methane condensation level, then is transported to high latitudes, where it descends and brings down methane depleted gas. Since this cell would seem to inhibit formation of condensation clouds in regions where clouds are actually inferred from spectral modelling, it suggests that sparse localized convective events may be important in cloud formation. The small-scale latitudinal variations we found in the effective methane mixing ratio between 55 deg N and 82 deg N have significant inverse correlations with zonal mean latitudinal variations in cloud reflectivity in near-IR Keck images taken before and after the HST observations. If the CH4/H2 absorption ratio variations are interpreted as local variations in para fraction instead of methane mixing ratio, we find that downwelling correlates with reduced cloud reflectivity. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.06550;Analytical Model of Tidal Distortion and Dissipation for a Giant Planet  with a Viscoelastic Core; Natalia I. Storch,  Dong Lai;  We present analytical expressions for the tidal Love numbers of a giant planet with a solid core and a fluid envelope. We model the core as a uniform, incompressible, elastic solid, and the envelope as a non-viscous fluid satisfying the $n=1$ polytropic equation of state. We discuss how the Love numbers depend on the size, density, and shear modulus of the core. We then model the core as a viscoelastic Maxwell solid and compute the tidal dissipation rate in the planet as characterized by the imaginary part of the Love number $k_2$. Our results improve upon existing calculations based on planetary models with a solid core and a uniform ($n=0$) envelope. Our analytical expressions for the Love numbers can be applied to study tidal distortion and viscoelastic dissipation of giant planets with solid cores of various rheological properties, and our general method can be extended to study tidal distortion/dissipation of super-earths. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.06558;Consolidating and Crushing Exoplanets: Did it happen here?; Kathryn Volk,  Brett Gladman;  The Kepler mission results indicate that systems of tightly-packed inner planets (STIPs) are present around of order 5% of FGK field stars (whose median age is ~5 Gyr). We propose that STIPs initially surrounded nearly all such stars and those observed are the final survivors of a process in which long-term metastability eventually ceases and the systems proceed to collisional consolidation or destruction, losing roughly equal fractions of systems every decade in time. In this context, we also propose that our Solar System initially contained additional large planets interior to the current orbit of Venus, which survived in a metastable dynamical configuration for 1-10% of the Solar System's age. Long-term gravitational perturbations caused the system to orbit cross, leading to a cataclysmic event which left Mercury as the sole surviving relic. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.06597;On the gap-opening criterion of migrating planets in protoplanetary  disks; Matej Malik,  Farzana Meru,  Lucio Mayer,  Michael R. Meyer;  We perform two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations to quantitatively explore the torque balance criterion for gap-opening (as formulated by Crida et al. 2006) in a variety of disks when considering a migrating planet. We find that even when the criterion is satisfied, there are instances when planets still do not open gaps. We stress that gap-opening is not only dependent on whether a planet has the ability to open a gap, but whether it can do so quickly enough. This can be expressed as an additional condition on the gap-opening timescale versus the crossing time, i.e. the time it takes the planet to cross the region which it is carving out. While this point has been briefly made in the previous literature, our results quantify it for a range of protoplanetary disk properties and planetary masses, demonstrating how crucial it is for gap-opening. This additional condition has important implications for the survival of planets formed by core accretion in low mass disks as well as giant planets or brown dwarfs formed by gravitational instability in massive disks. It is particularly important for planets with intermediate masses susceptible to Type III-like migration. For some observed transition disks or disks with gaps, we expect that estimates on the potential planet masses based on the torque balance gap-opening criterion alone may not be sufficient. With consideration of this additional timescale criterion theoretical studies may find a reduced planet survivability or that planets may migrate further inwards before opening a gap. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.06612;The Hubble Wide Field Camera 3 Test of Surfaces in the Outer Solar  System: Spectral Variation on Kuiper Belt Objects; Wesley C. Fraser,  Michael E. Brown,  Florian Glass;  Here we present additional photometry of targets observed as part of the Hubble Wide Field Camera 3 Test of Surfaces in the Outer Solar System. 12 targets were re-observed with the Wide Field Camera 3 in optical and NIR wavebands designed to compliment those used during the first visit. Additionally, all observations originally presented by Fraser and Brown (2012) were reanalyzed through the same updated photometry pipeline. A reanalysis of the optical and NIR colour distribution reveals a bifurcated optical colour distribution and only two identifiable spectral classes, each of which occupies a broad range of colours and have correlated optical and NIR colours, in agreement with our previous findings. We report the detection of significant spectral variations on 5 targets which cannot be attributed to photometry errors, cosmic rays, point spread function or sensitivity variations, or other image artifacts capable of explaining the magnitude of the variation. The spectrally variable objects are found to have a broad range of dynamical classes, absolute magnitudes, exhibit a broad range of apparent magnitude variations, and are found in both compositional classes. The spectrally variable objects with sufficiently accurate colours for spectral classification maintain their membership, belonging to the same class at both epochs. 2005 TV189 exhibits a sufficiently broad difference in colour at the two epochs that span the full range of colours of the neutral class. This strongly argues that the neutral class is one single class with a broad range of colours, rather than the combination of multiple overlapping classes. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

";  We reanalyze microlensing events in the published list of anomalous events that were observed from the OGLE lensing survey conducted during 2004-2008 period. In order to check the existence of possible degenerate solutions and extract extra information, we conduct analyses based on combined data from other survey and follow-up observation and consider higher-order effects. Among the analyzed events, we present analyses of 8 events for which either new solutions are identified or additional information is obtained. We find that the previous binary-source interpretations of 5 events are better interpreted by binary-lens models. These events include OGLE-2006-BLG-238, OGLE-2007-BLG-159, OGLE-2007-BLG-491, OGLE-2008-BLG-143, and OGLE-2008-BLG-210. With additional data covering caustic crossings, we detect finite-source effects for 6 events including OGLE-2006-BLG-215, OGLE-2006-BLG-238, OGLE-2006-BLG-450, OGLE-2008-BLG-143, OGLE-2008-BLG-210, and OGLE-2008-BLG-513. Among them, we are able to measure the Einstein radii of 3 events for which multi-band data are available. These events are OGLE-2006-BLG-238, OGLE-2008-BLG-210, and OGLE-2008-BLG-513. For OGLE-2008-BLG-143, we detect higher-order effect induced by the changes of the observer's position caused by the orbital motion of the Earth around the Sun. In addition, we present degenerate solutions resulting from the known close/wide or ecliptic degeneracy. Finally, we note that the masses of the binary companions of the lenses of OGLE-2006-BLG-450 and OGLE-2008-BLG-210 are in the brown-dwarf regime. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.06701;Theory for planetary exospheres: I. Radiation pressure effect on  dynamical trajectories; Arnaud Beth,  Philippe Garnier,  Dominique Toublanc,  Iannis Dandouras,  Christian Mazelle;  The planetary exospheres are poorly known in their outer parts, since the neutral densities are low compared with the instruments detection capabilities. The exospheric models are thus often the main source of information at such high altitudes. We present a new way to take into account analytically the additional effect of the radiation pressure on planetary exospheres. In a series of papers, we present with an Hamiltonian approach the effect of the radiation pressure on dynamical trajectories, density profiles and escaping thermal flux. Our work is a generalization of the study by Bishop and Chamberlain (1989). In this first paper, we present the complete exact solutions of particles trajectories, which are not conics, under the influence of the solar radiation pressure. This problem was recently partly solved by Lantoine and Russell (2011) and completely by Biscani and Izzo (2014). We give here the full set of solutions, including solutions not previously derived, as well as simpler formulations for previously known cases and comparisons with recent works. The solutions given may also be applied to the classical Stark problem (Stark,1914): we thus provide here for the first time the complete set of solutions for this well-known effect in term of Jacobi elliptic functions. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.06854;Linking Europa's plume activity to tides, tectonics, and liquid water; Alyssa R. Rhoden,  Terry A. Hurford,  Lorenz Roth,  Kurt Retherford;  Much of the geologic activity preserved on Europa's icy surface has been attributed to tidal deformation, mainly due to Europa's eccentric orbit. Although the surface is geologically young (30 - 80 Myr), there is little information as to whether tidally-driven surface processes are ongoing. However, a recent detection of water vapor near Europa's south pole suggests that it may be geologically active. Initial observations indicated that Europa's plume eruptions are time-variable and may be linked to its tidal cycle. Saturn's moon, Enceladus, which shares many similar traits with Europa, displays tidally-modulated plume eruptions, which bolstered this interpretation. However, additional observations of Europa at the same time in its orbit failed to yield a plume detection, casting doubt on the tidal control hypothesis. The purpose of this study is to analyze the timing of plume eruptions within the context of Europa's tidal cycle to determine whether such a link exists and examine the inferred similarities and differences between plume activity on Europa and Enceladus. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Guilera;  Models of planet formation are mainly focused on the accretion and dynamical processes of the planets, neglecting their chemical composition. In this work, we calculate the condensation sequence of the different chemical elements for a low-mass protoplanetary disk around a solar-type star. We incorporate this sequence of chemical elements (refractory and volatile elements) in our semi-analytical model of planet formation which calculates the formation of a planetary system during its gaseous phase. The results of the semi-analytical model (final distributions of embryos and planetesimals) are used as initial conditions to develope N-body simulations that compute the post-oligarchic formation of terrestrial-type planets. The results of our simulations show that the chemical composition of the planets that remain in the habitable zone has similar characteristics to the chemical composition of the Earth. However, exist differences that can be associated to the dynamical environment in which they were formed. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.06965;Calibrating Gyrochronology using Kepler Asteroseismic targets; Ruth Angus,  Suzanne Aigrain,  Daniel Foreman-Mackey,  Amy McQuillan;  Among the available methods for dating stars, gyrochronology is a powerful one because it requires knowledge of only the star's mass and rotation period. Gyrochronology relations have previously been calibrated using young clusters, with the Sun providing the only age dependence, and are therefore poorly calibrated at late ages. We used rotation period measurements of 310 Kepler stars with asteroseismic ages, 50 stars from the Hyades and Coma Berenices clusters and 6 field stars (including the Sun) with precise age measurements to calibrate the gyrochronology relation, whilst fully accounting for measurement uncertainties in all observable quantities. We calibrated a relation of the form $P=A^n\times(B-V-c)^b$, where $P$ is rotation period in days, $A$ is age in Myr, $B$ and $V$ are magnitudes and $a$, $b$ and $n$ are the free parameters of our model. We found $a = 0.40^{+0.3}_{-0.05}$, $b = 0.31^{+0.05}_{-0.02}$ and $n = 0.55^{+0.02}_{-0.09}$. Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods were used to explore the posterior probability distribution functions of the gyrochronology parameters and we carefully checked the effects of leaving out parts of our sample, leading us to find that no single relation beween rotation period, colour and age can adequately describe all the subsets of our data. The Kepler asteroseismic stars, cluster stars and local field stars cannot all be described by the same gyrochronology relation. The Kepler asteroseismic stars may be subject to observational biases, however the clusters show unexpected deviations from the predicted behaviour, providing concerns for the overall reliability of gyrochronology as a dating method. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.06970;Balancing the Energy Budget of Short-Period Giant Planets: Evidence for  Reflective Clouds and Optical Absorbers; Joel C. Schwartz,  Nicolas B. Cowan;"  We consider fifty transiting short-period giant planets for which eclipse depths have been measured at multiple infrared wavelengths. The aggregate dayside emission spectrum of these planets exhibits no molecular features, nor is brightness temperature greater in the near-infrared. We combine brightness temperatures at various infrared wavelengths to estimate the dayside effective temperature of each planet. We find that dayside temperatures are proportional to irradiation temperatures, indicating modest Bond albedo and no internal energy sources, plus weak evidence that dayside temperatures of the hottest planets are disproportionately high. We place joint constraints on Bond albedo, $A_{B}$, and day-to-night transport efficiency, $\varepsilon$, for six planets by combining thermal eclipse and phase variation measurements (HD 149026b, HD 189733b, HD 209458b, WASP-12b, WASP-18b, and WASP-43b). We confirm that planets with high irradiation temperatures have low heat transport efficiency, and that WASP-43b has inexplicably poor transport; these results are statistically significant even if the precision of single-eclipse measurements has been overstated by a factor of three. Lastly, we attempt to break the $A_{B}$-$\varepsilon$ degeneracy for nine planets with both thermal and optical eclipse observations, but no thermal phase measurements. We find a systematic offset between Bond albedos inferred from thermal phase variations ($A_{B} \approx 0.35$) and geometric albedos extracted from visible light measurements ($A_{g} \approx 0.1$). These observations can be reconciled if most hot Jupiters have clouds that reflect 30-50 per cent of incident near-infrared radiation, as well as optical absorbers in the cloud particles or above the cloud deck.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.06971;The destruction of inner planetary systems during high-eccentricity  migration of gas giants; Alexander J. Mustill,  Melvyn B. Davies,  Anders Johansen;  Hot Jupiters are giant planets on orbits a few hundredths of an AU. They do not share their system with low-mass close-in planets, despite these latter being exceedingly common. Two migration channels for hot Jupiters have been proposed: through a protoplanetary gas disc or by tidal circularisation of highly-eccentric planets. We show that highly-eccentric giant planets that will become hot Jupiters clear out any low-mass inner planets in the system, explaining the observed lack of such companions to hot Jupiters. A less common outcome of the interaction is that the giant planet is ejected by the inner planets. Furthermore, the interaction can implant giant planets on moderately-high eccentricities at semimajor axes $<1$ AU, a region otherwise hard to populate. Our work supports the hypothesis that most hot Jupiters reached their current orbits following a phase of high eccentricity, possibly excited by other planetary or stellar companions. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.06991;What are little worlds made of? Stellar abundances and the building  blocks of planets; Eric Gaidos;"  If the photospheres of solar-type stars represent the composition of circumstellar disks from which any planets formed, spectroscopic determinations of stellar elemental abundances offer information on the composition of those planets, including smaller, rocky planets. In particular, the C/O ratio is proposed to be a key determinant of the composition of solids that condense from disk gas and are incorporated into planets. Also, planets may leave chemical signatures on the photospheres of their host stars by sequestering heavy elements, or by being accreted by the stars. The presence, absence, and composition of planets could be revealed by small differences in the relative abundances between stars. I critically examine these scenarios and show that (i) a model of Galactic chemical evolution predicts that the C/O ratio is expected to be close to the solar value and vary little between dwarf stars in the solar neighborhood; (ii) spectroscopic surveys of M dwarf stars limit the occurrence of stars with C/O $\gtrsim 1$ to $<10^{-3}$; and (iii) planetesimal chemistry will be controlled by the composition of oxygen-rich dust inherited from the molecular cloud and processed in a dust-rich environment, not a gas with the stellar composition. A second generation of more reduced planetesimals could be produced by re-equilibration of some material with dust-depleted gas. Finally, I discuss how minor differences in relative abundances between stars that correlate with condensation temperature can be explained by dust-gas segregation, perhaps in circumstellar disks, rather than planet formation.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.07090;Viscoelastic Models of Tidally Heated Exomoons; Vera Dobos,  Edwin L. Turner;  Tidal heating of exomoons may play a key role in their habitability, since the elevated temperature can melt the ice on the body even without significant solar radiation. The possibility of life is intensely studied on Solar System moons such as Europa or Enceladus, where the surface ice layer covers tidally heated water ocean. Tidal forces may be even stronger in extrasolar systems, depending on the properties of the moon and its orbit. For studying the tidally heated surface temperature of exomoons, we used a viscoelastic model for the first time. This model is more realistic than the widely used, so-called fixed Q models, because it takes into account the temperature dependency of the tidal heat flux, and the melting of the inner material. With the use of this model we introduced the circumplanetary Tidal Temperate Zone (TTZ), that strongly depends on the orbital period of the moon, and less on its radius. We compared the results with the fixed Q model and investigated the statistical volume of the TTZ using both models. We have found that the viscoelastic model predicts 2.8 times more exomoons in the TTZ with orbital periods between 0.1 and 3.5 days than the fixed Q model for plausible distributions of physical and orbital parameters. The viscoelastic model gives more promising results in terms of habitability, because the inner melting of the body moderates the surface temperature, acting like a thermostat. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.07216;The pre-perihelion activity of dynamically new comet C/2013 A1 (Siding  Spring) and its close encounter with Mars; Dennis Bodewits,  Michael S.P. Kelley,  Jian-Yang Li,  Tony L. Farnham,  Michael F. A'Hearn;  We used the UltraViolet-Optical Telescope on board Swift to systematically follow the dynamically new comet C/2013 A1 (Siding Spring) on its approach to the Sun. The comet was observed from a heliocentric distance of 4.5 AU pre-perihelion to its perihelion at 1.4 AU. From our observations, we estimate that the water production rate during closest approach to Mars was 1.5 +/- 0.3 x 1E28 molecules/s, that peak gas delivery rates were between 4.5-8.8 kg/s, and that in total between 3.1-5.4 x 1E4 kg cometary gas was delivered to the planet. Seasonal and evolutionary effects on the nucleus govern the pre-perihelion activity of comet Siding Spring. The sudden increase of its water production between 2.46-2.06 AU suggests the onset of the sublimation of icy grains in the coma, likely driven by CO2. As the comet got closer to the Sun, the relative contribution of the nucleus' water production increased, while CO2 production rates decreased. The changes in the comet's activity can be explained by a depletion of CO2, but the comet's high mass loss rate suggests they may also reflect primordial heterogeneities in the nucleus. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.07346;A primordial origin for the composition similarity between the Earth and  the Moon; Alessandra Mastrobuono-Battisti,  Hagai B. Perets,  Sean N. Raymond;  Most of the properties of the Earth-Moon system can be explained by a collision between a planetary embryo and the growing Earth late in the accretion process. Simulations show that most of the material that eventually aggregates to form the Moon originates from the impactor. However, analysis of the terrestrial and lunar isotopic composition show them to be highly similar. In contrast, the compositions of other solar system bodies are significantly different than the Earth and Moon. This poses a major challenge to the giant impact scenario since the Moon-forming impactor is then thought to also have differed in composition from the proto-Earth. Here we track the feeding zones of growing planets in a suite of simulations of planetary accretion, in order to measure the composition of Moon-forming impactors. We find that different planets formed in the same simulation have distinct compositions, but the compositions of giant impactors are systematically more similar to the planets they impact. A significant fraction of planet-impactor pairs have virtually identical compositions. Thus, the similarity in composition between the Earth and Moon could be a natural consequence of a late giant impact. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.07369;The Impact of Dust Evolution and Photoevaporation on Disk Dispersal; Uma Gorti,  David Hollenbach,  Cornelis Dullemond;"  Protoplanetary disks are dispersed by viscous evolution and photoevaporation in a few million years; in the interim small, sub-micron sized dust grains must grow and form planets. The time-varying abundance of small grains in an evolving disk directly affects gas heating by far-ultraviolet photons, while dust evolution affects photoevaporation by changing the disk opacity and resulting penetration of FUV photons in the disk. Photoevaporative flows, in turn, selectively carry small dust grains leaving the larger particles---which decouple from the gas---behind in the disk. We study these effects by investigating the evolution of a disk subject to viscosity, photoevaporation by EUV, FUV and X-rays, dust evolution, and radial drift using a 1-D multi-fluid approach (gas + different dust grain sizes) to solve for the evolving surface density distributions. The 1-D evolution is augmented by 1+1D models constructed at each epoch to obtain the instantaneous disk structure and determine photoevaporation rates. The implementation of a dust coagulation/fragmentation model results in a marginal decrease in disk lifetimes when compared to models with no dust evolution; the disk lifetime is thus found to be relatively insensitive to the evolving dust opacity. We find that photoevaporation can cause significant reductions in the gas/dust mass ratio in the planet-forming regions of the disk as it evolves, and may result in a corresponding increase in heavy element abundances relative to hydrogen. We discuss implications for theories of planetesimal formation and giant planet formation, including the formation of gas-poor giants. After gas disk dispersal, $\sim 3\times 10^{-4}$ \ms\ of mass in solids typically remain, comparable to the solids inventory of our solar system. ";Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

We also discover new planets orbiting the known exoplanet host stars HD 164922 and HD 143761 ($\rho$ CrB). The new planet orbiting HD 164922 has a minimum mass of $12.9 \pm 1.6$ M$_{\oplus}$ and orbits interior to the previously known Jovian mass planet orbiting at 2.1 AU. HD 164922 c has a semi-major axis of 0.34 AU and an equilibrium temperature of 418 K. HD 143761 c orbits with a semi-major axis of 0.44 AU, has a minimum mass of $25 \pm 2$ M$_{\oplus}$, and is the warmest of the three new planets with an equilibrium temperature of 445 K. It orbits exterior to the previously known warm Jupiter in the system. A transit search using space-based CoRoT data and ground-based photometry from the Automated Photometric Telescopes (APTs) at Fairborn Observatory failed to detect any transits, but the precise, high-cadence APT photometry helped to disentangle planetary-reflex motion from stellar activity. These planets were discovered as part of an ongoing radial velocity survey of bright, nearby, chromospherically-inactive stars using the Automated Planet Finder (APF) telescope at Lick Observatory. The high-cadence APF data combined with nearly two decades of radial velocity data from Keck Observatory and gives unprecedented sensitivity to both short-period low-mass, and long-period intermediate-mass planets. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

We present the projected rotational velocity of the young sub-stellar companion GQ Lupi b, along with its barycentric radial velocity. The directly imaged exoplanet or brown dwarf companion joins a small but growing ensemble of wide-orbit sub-stellar companions with a spin measurement. The GQ Lupi system was observed at high spectral resolution (R ~ 100000), and in the analysis we made use of both spectral and spatial filtering to separate the signal of the companion from that of the host star. We detect both CO (S/N=11.6) and H2O (S/N=7.7) in the atmosphere of GQ Lupi b by cross-correlating with model spectra, and we find it to be a slow rotator with a projected rotational velocity of $5.3^{+0.9}_{-1.0}$ km/s. The slow rotation is most likely due to its young age of < 5 Myr, as it is still in the process of accreting material and angular momentum. We measure the barycentric radial velocity of GQ Lupi b to be $2.0 \pm 0.4$ km/s, and discuss the allowed orbital configurations and their implications for formation scenarios for GQ Lupi b. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

HATS-19b is in an eccentric orbit (e = 0.30) around this star with an orbital period of 4.5697 days and has a mass of 0.427 Mjup and a highly inflated radius of 1.66 Rjup. The planet HATS-20b has a Saturn-like mass and radius of 0.273 Mjup and 0.776 Rjup respectively. It orbits the V = 13.8 G9V star HATS-20 (Ms = 0.910 Msun; Rs = 0.892 Rsun) with a period of 3.7993 days. Finally, HATS-21 is a V = 12.2 G4V star with [Fe/H] = 0.300, a mass of 1.080 Msun, and a radius of 1.021 Rsun. Its accompanying planet HATS-21b has a 3.5544-day orbital period, a mass of 0.332 Mjup, and a moderately inflated radius of 1.123 Rjup. With the addition of these three very different planets to the growing sample of hot-Saturns, we re-examine the relations between the observed giant planet radii, stellar irradiation, and host metallicity. We find a significant positive correlation between planet equilibrium temperature and radius, and a weak negative correlation between host metallicity and radius. To assess the relative influence of various physical parameters on observed planet radii, we train and fit models using Random Forest regression. We find that for hot-Saturns (0.1 < Mp < 0.5 Mjup), the planetary mass and equilibrium temperature play dominant roles in determining radii. For hot-Jupiters (0.5 < Mp < 2.0 Mjup), the most important parameter is equilibrium temperature alone. Finally, for irradiated higher-mass planets (Mp > 2.0 Mjup), we find that equilibrium temperature dominates in influence, with smaller contributions from planet mass and host metallicity.

Birnstiel;  Spatially resolved polarized (sub-)mm emission has been observed for example in the protoplanetary disk around HL Tau. Magnetically aligned grains are commonly interpreted as the source of polarization. However, self-scattering by large dust grains with a high enough albedo is another polarization mechanism, becoming a compelling method independent of the spectral index to constrain the dust grain size in protoplanetary disks. We study the dust polarization at mm wavelength in the dust trapping scenario proposed for transition disks, when a giant planet opens a gap in the disk. We investigate the characteristic polarization patterns and their dependence on disk inclination, dust size evolution, planet position, and observing wavelength. We combine two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of planet-disk interactions with self-consistent dust growth models. These size-dependent dust density distributions are used for follow-up three-dimensional radiative transfer calculations to predict the polarization degree at ALMA bands due to scattered thermal emission. We find that the polarization pattern of a disk with a planetary gap after 1 Myr of dust evolution shows a distinctive three ring structure. Two narrow inner rings are located at the planet gap edges. For increasing observing wavelengths all three rings slightly change their position, where the innermost and outermost rings move inward. This distance is detectable comparing the results at ALMA bands 3, 6 and 7. Within the highest polarized intensity regions the polarization vectors are oriented in the azimuthal direction. For an inclined disk there is an interplay between polarization originating from a flux gradient and inclination-induced quadrupole polarization. For intermediate inclined transition disks the polarization degree is as high as ~ 2% at band 3, which is well above the detection limit of future ALMA observations. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Rimmer,  Daniel Kitzmann,  Kevin Heng;"  We present an open-source and validated chemical kinetics code for studying hot exoplanetary atmospheres, which we name VULCAN. It is constructed for gaseous chemistry from 500 to 2500 K using a reduced C-H-O chemical network with about 300 reactions. It uses eddy diffusion to mimic atmospheric dynamics and excludes photochemistry. We have provided a full description of the rate coefficients and thermodynamic data used. We validate VULCAN by reproducing chemical equilibrium and by comparing its output versus the disequilibrium-chemistry calculations of Moses et al. and Rimmer & Helling. It reproduces the models of HD 189733b and HD 209458b by Moses et al., which employ a network with nearly 1600 reactions. We also use VULCAN to examine the theoretical trends produced when the temperature-pressure profile and carbon-to-oxygen ratio are varied. Assisted by a sensitivity test designed to identify the key reactions responsible for producing a specific molecule, we revisit the quenching approximation and find that it is accurate for methane but breaks down for acetylene, because the disequilibrium abundance of acetylene is not directly determined by transport-induced quenching, but is rather indirectly controlled by the disequilibrium abundance of methane. Therefore, we suggest that the quenching approximation should be used with caution and must always be checked against a chemical kinetics calculation. A one-dimensional model atmosphere with 100 layers, computed using VULCAN, typically takes several minutes to complete.

GonzÃ¡lez;  In the present paper, using the first-order approximation of the $n$-body Lagrangian (derived on the basis of the post-Newtonian gravitational theory of Einstein, Infeld, and Hoffman), we explicitly write down the equations of motion for the planar circular restricted three-body problem. Additionally, with some simplified assumptions, we obtain two formulas for estimating the values of the mass/distance and velocity/speed of light ratios appropriate for a given post-Newtonian approximation. We show that the formulas derived in the present study, lead to a good numerical conservation of the Jacobi constant and allow for an approximate equivalence between the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian approaches at the same post-Newtonian order. Accordingly, the dynamics of the system is analyzed in terms of the Poincar\'e sections method and Lyapunov exponents, finding that for specific values of the Jacobi constant the dynamics can be either chaotic or regular. Our results suggest that the chaoticity of the post-Newtonian system is slightly in- creased in comparison with its Newtonian counterpart. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)"

EVEREST employs a variant of pixel level decorrelation (PLD) to remove systematics introduced by the spacecraft's pointing error and a Gaussian process (GP) to capture astrophysical variability. We apply EVEREST to all K2 targets in campaigns 0-7, yielding light curves with precision comparable to that of the original Kepler mission for stars brighter than $K_p \approx 13$, and within a factor of two of the Kepler precision for fainter targets. We perform cross-validation and transit injection and recovery tests to validate the pipeline, and compare our light curves to the other de-trended light curves available for download at the MAST High Level Science Products archive. We find that EVEREST achieves the highest average precision of any of these pipelines for unsaturated K2 stars. The improved precision of these light curves will aid in exoplanet detection and characterization, investigations of stellar variability, asteroseismology, and other photometric studies. The EVEREST pipeline can also easily be applied to future surveys, such as the TESS mission, to correct for instrumental systematics and enable the detection of low signal-to-noise transiting exoplanets.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00628;On the orbital evolution of a pair of giant planets in mean motion  resonance; Q. AndrÃ©,  J.C.B. Papaloizou;  Pairs of extrasolar giant planets in a mean motion commensurability are common with 2:1 resonance occurring most frequently. Disc-planet interaction provides a mechanism for their origin. However, the time scale on which this could operate in particular cases is unclear. We perform 2D and 3D numerical simulations of pairs of giant planets in a protoplanetary disc as they form and maintain a mean motion commensurability. We consider systems with current parameters similar to those of HD 155358, 24 Sextantis and HD 60532, and disc models of varying mass, decreasing mass corresponding to increasing age. For the lowest mass discs, systems with planets in the Jovian mass range migrate inwards maintaining a 2:1 commensurability. Systems with the inner planet currently at around 1 au from the central star could have originated at a few au and migrated inwards on a time scale comparable to protoplanetary disc lifetimes. Systems of larger mass planets such as HD 60532 attain 3:1 resonance as observed. For a given mass accretion rate, results are insensitive to the disc model for the range of viscosity prescriptions adopted, there being good agreement between 2D and 3D simulations. However, in a higher mass disc a pair of Jovian mass planets passes through 2:1 resonance before attaining a temporary phase lasting a few thousand orbits in an unstable 5:3 resonance prior to undergoing a scattering. Thus finding systems in this commensurability is unlikely. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01013;Knot a Bad Idea: Testing BLISS Mapping for Spitzer Space Telescope  Photometry; Joel C. Schwartz,  Nicolas B. Cowan;  Much of transiting exoplanet science relies on high-precision photometry. The current generation of instruments can exhibit sensitivity variations greater than the astrophysical signals. For the InfraRed Array Camera (IRAC) on the Spitzer Space Telescope, a popular way to handle this is BiLinearly-Interpolated Subpixel Sensitivity (BLISS) mapping. As part of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), BLISS mapping estimates the sensitivity at many locations (knots) on the pixel, then interpolates to the target star's centroids. We show that such embedded optimization schemes can misfit or bias parameters. Thus, we construct a model of $\textit{Spitzer}$ eclipse light curves to test the accuracy and precision of BLISS mapping. We compare standard BLISS mapping to a variant where the knots are fit during the MCMC, as well as to a polynomial model. Both types of BLISS mapping give similar eclipse depths, and we find that standard knots behave like real parameters. Standard BLISS mapping is therefore a reasonable shortcut to fitting for knots in an MCMC. BLISS maps become inaccurate when the photon noise is low, but typically approximate the real sensitivity well. We also find there is no perfect method for choosing the ideal number of BLISS knots to use on given data. BLISS mapping gives fits that are usually more accurate than precise (i.e. they are overly conservative), and the routine is more precise than polynomial models for significant eclipses or pixels with more varied sensitivities. BLISS mapping has better predictive power for most of these particular synthetic data, depending on how one treats time-correlated residuals. Overall, we conclude that BLISS mapping can be a reasonable sensitivity model for IRAC photometry. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Trigo-RodrÃ­guez,  Jordi Llorca,  Sonia Fornasier,  Maria A. Barucci,  Albert Rimola;  A crucial topic in planetology research is establishing links between primitive meteorites and their parent asteroids. In this study we investigate the feasibility of a connection between asteroids similar to 21 Lutetia, encountered by the Rosetta mission in July 2010, and the CH3 carbonaceous chondrite Pecora Escarpment 91467 (PCA 91467). Several spectra of this meteorite were acquired in the ultraviolet to near-infrared (0.3 to 2.2 {\mu}m) and in the mid-infrared to thermal infrared (2.5 to 30.0 {\mu}m or 4000 to ~333 cm^-1), and they are compared here to spectra from the asteroid 21 Lutetia. There are several similarities in absorption bands and overall spectral behavior between this CH3 meteorite and 21 Lutetia. Considering also that the bulk density of Lutetia is similar to that of CH chondrites, we suggest that this asteroid could be similar, or related to, the parent body of these meteorites, if not the parent body itself. However, the apparent surface diversity of Lutetia pointed out in previous studies indicates that it could simultaneously be related to other types of chondrites. Future discovery of additional unweathered CH chondrites could provide deeper insight in the possible connection between this family of metal-rich carbonaceous chondrites and 21 Lutetia or other featureless, possibly hydrated high-albedo asteroids. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01282;Impact-induced differentiation in icy bodies; W. Brian Tonks,  Elisabetta Pierazzo,  H. Jay Melosh;  By the time icy objects grow to about the mass of Europa and silicate bodies grow to approximately lunar mass, a large high-speed impact can generate an intact melt region that allows the dense material to gravitationally segregate, forming a large density anomaly. If this anomaly generates sufficient differential stress, it rapidly segregates to the object's center, triggering whole body differentiation. We used an impact melting model based on the Hugoniot equations, the linear shock-particle velocity relationship, and the empirical relationship between shock pressure and distance coupled with a Monte Carlo simulation of the late accretion process to determine conditions under which large impacts trigger differentiation in icy bodies. In a gas-free environment, impacts of projectiles in the satellite's accretion zone have a small probability of triggering differentiation in surviving proto-satellites as small as Triton. The probability increases to 100% by the time surviving proto-satellites grow to the mass of Europa. The impact of heliocentric particles captured by the central planet also effectively triggers differentiation in the icy satellites. If the largest projectiles in the heliocentric distribution are comparable to the mass of the growing satellites, they trigger differentiation in all surviving proto-satellites by the time they grow to the mass of Callisto. However, Callisto and Ganymede have different probabilities of impact-induced differentiation if they captured a small fraction (0.01 and 0.5%) of the particles they accreted from a distribution of small (largest particles ~10% of the satellite's mass) heliocentric objects. Impact induced differentiation explains the apparent difference between these two objects in a plausible way. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Most of our objects are K & M stars with large excesses at 24 $\mu$m. We used irradiated accretion disk models of D'Alessio et al. (2006) to compare their spectral energy distributions with our observational data. We arrive at the following six conclusions. (i) The observed disks are consistent with irradiated accretion disks systems. (ii) Most of our objects (60%) can be explained by significant dust depletion from the upper disk layers. (iii) Similarly, 61% of our objects can be modeled with large disk sizes ($\rm R_{\rm d} \geq$ 100 AU). (iv) The masses of our disks range between 0.03 to 39 $\rm M_{Jup}$, where 35% of our objects have disk masses lower than 1 Jupiter. Although these are lower limits, high mass ($>$ 0.05 M$_{\odot}$) disks, which are present e.g, in Taurus, are missing. (v) By assuming a uniform distribution of objects around the brightest stars at the center of the cluster, we found that 80% of our disks are exposed to external FUV radiation of $300 \leq G_{0} \leq 1000$, which can be strong enough to photoevaporate the outer edges of the closer disks. (vi) Within 0.6 pc from $\sigma$ Ori we found forbidden emission lines of [NII] in the spectrum of one of our large disk (SO662), but no emission in any of our small ones. This suggests that this object may be an example of a photoevaporating disk. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01397;White dwarf pollution by planets in stellar binaries; Adrian S. Hamers,  Simon F. Portegies Zwart;  Approximately $0.2 \pm 0.2$ of white dwarfs (WDs) show signs of pollution by metals, which is likely due to the accretion of tidally disrupted planetary material. Models invoking planet-planet interactions after WD formation generally cannot explain pollution at cooling times of several Gyr. We consider a scenario in which a planet is perturbed by Lidov-Kozai oscillations induced by a binary companion and exacerbated by stellar mass loss, explaining pollution at long cooling times. Our computed accretion rates are consistent with observations assuming planetary masses between $\sim 0.01$ and $1\,M_\mathrm{Mars}$, although nongravitational effects may already be important for masses $\lesssim 0.3 \, M_\mathrm{Mars}$. The fraction of polluted WDs in our simulations, $\sim 0.05$, is consistent with observations of WDs with intermediate cooling times between $\sim 0.1$ and 1 Gyr. For cooling times $\lesssim 0.1$ Gyr and $\gtrsim 1$ Gyr, our scenario cannot explain the high observed pollution fractions of up to 0.7. Nevertheless, our results motivate searches for companions around polluted WDs. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01777;Tracking Neptune's Migration History through High-Perihelion Resonant  Trans-Neptunian Objects; Nathan A. Kaib,  Scott S. Sheppard;  Recently, Sheppard et al. (2016) presented the discovery of seven new trans-Neptunian objects with moderate eccentricities, perihelia beyond 40 AU, and semimajor axes beyond 50 AU. Like the few previously known objects on similar orbits, these objects' semimajor axes are just beyond the Kuiper belt edge and clustered around Neptunian mean motion resonances (MMRs). These objects likely obtained their observed orbits while trapped within MMRs, when the Kozai-Lidov mechanism raised their perihelia and weakened Neptune's dynamical influence. Using numerical simulations that model the production of this population, we find that high-perihelion objects near Neptunian MMRs can constrain the nature and timescale of Neptune's past orbital migration. In particular, the population near the 3:1 MMR (near 62 AU) is especially useful due to its large population and short dynamical evolution timescale. If Neptune finishes migrating within ~100 Myrs or less, we predict over 90% of high-perihelion objects near the 3:1 MMR will have semimajor axes within 1 AU of each other, very near the modern resonance's center. On the other hand, if Neptune's migration takes ~300 Myrs, we expect ~50% of this population to reside in dynamically fossilized orbits over ~1 AU closer to the Sun than the modern resonance. We highlight 2015 KH162 as a likely member of this fossilized 3:1 population. Under any plausible migration scenario, nearly all high-perihelion objects in resonances beyond the 4:1 MMR (near 76 AU) reach their orbits well after Neptune stops migrating and comprise a recently generated, dynamically active population. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01792;Self-Destructing Spiral Waves: Global Simulations of a Spiral Wave  Instability in Accretion Disks; Jaehan Bae,  Richard P. Nelson,  Lee Hartmann,  Samuel Richard;  We present results from a suite of three-dimensional global hydrodynamic simulations which show that spiral density waves propagating in circumstellar disks are unstable to the growth of a parametric instability that leads to break-down of the flow into turbulence. This spiral wave instability (SWI) arises from a resonant interaction between pairs of inertial waves, or inertial-gravity waves, and the background spiral wave. The development of the instability in the linear regime involves the growth of a broad spectrum of inertial modes, with growth rates on the order of the orbital time, and results in a nonlinear saturated state in which turbulent velocity perturbations are of a similar magnitude to those induced by the spiral wave. The turbulence induces angular momentum transport, and vertical mixing, at a rate that depends locally on the amplitude of the spiral wave (we obtain a stress parameter $\alpha \sim 5 \times 10^{-4}$ in our reference model). The instability is found to operate in a wide-range of disk models, including those with isothermal or adiabatic equations of state, and in viscous disks where the dimensionless kinematic viscosity $\nu\le 10^{-5}$. This robustness suggests that the instability will have applications to a broad range of astrophysical disk-related phenomena, including those in close binary systems, planets embedded in protoplanetary disks (including Jupiter in our own Solar System) and FU Orionis outburst models. Further work is required to determine the nature of the instability, and to evaluate its observational consequences, in physically more complete disk models than we have considered in this paper. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

The primary objective of the project is to search for new hot Jupiters which transit their host stars, mainly in the Galactic plane, in the $R_c$ magnitude range of 11 to 14 mag. Our observations were performed with the telescope of the MASTER robotic network, installed at the Kourovka astronomical observatory of the Ural Federal University (Russia), and the Rowe-Ackermann Schmidt Astrograph, installed at the private Acton Sky Portal Observatory (USA). As test observations, we observed three celestial fields of size $2\times2$ deg$^2$ during the period from 2012 to 2015. As a result, we discovered four transiting exoplanet candidates among the 39000 stars of the input catalogue. In this paper, we provide the description of the project and analyse additional photometric, spectral, and speckle interferometric observations of the discovered transiting exoplanet candidates. Three of the four transiting exoplanet candidates are most likely astrophysical false positives, while the nature of the fourth (most promising) candidate remains to be ascertained. Also, we propose an alternative observing strategy that could increase the project's exoplanet haul. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Tsirvoulis;"  In this work we have estimated 10 collisional ages of 9 families for which for different reasons our previous attempts failed. In general, these are difficult cases that required dedicated effort, such as a new family classifications for asteroids in mean motion resonances, as well as a revision of the classification inside the $3/2$ resonance. Of the families locked in mean motion resonances, we succeeded in determining ages of the families of (1911) Schubart and of the ""super-Hilda"" family, assuming this is actually a severely eroded original family of (153) Hilda. In the Trojan region we found families with almost no Yarkovsky evolution, for which we could compute only physically implausible ages. Hence, we interpreted their modest dispersions of proper eccentricities and inclinations as implying that the Trojan asteroid families are fossil families, frozen at their proper elements determined by the original ejection velocity field. We have found a new family, among the Griquas locked in the 2/1 resonance with Jupiter: (11097) 1994 UD1. We have estimated the ages of 6 families affected by secular resonances: families of (5) Astraea, (25) Phocaea, (283) Emma, (363) Padua, (686) Gersuind, and (945) Barcelona. By using a numerical calibration method, we have shown that the secular resonances do not affect significanly the secular change of proper a. For the family of (145) Adeona we could estimate the age only after removal of a number of assumed interlopers. With the present paper we have concluded the series dedicated to the determination of asteroid ages with a uniform method. We computed the ages for a total of 57 families with $>100$ members. There remain families too small at present to provide reliable estimates, as well as some complex families (221, 135, 298) which may have more ages than we could currently estimate.

First we determine the location of the linear secular resonances with Ceres and Vesta in the main belt, using a purely numerical technique. Then we use a set of numerical simulations of fictitious asteroids to investigate the importance of these secular resonances in the orbital evolution of main-belt asteroids. We found, evaluating the magnitude of the perturbations in the proper elements of the test particles, that in some cases the strength of these secular resonances is comparable to that of known non-linear secular resonances with the giant planets. Finally we explore the asteroid families that are crossed by the secular resonances we studied, and identified several cases where the latter seem to play an important role in their post-impact evolution. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Madiedo;  We analyze the activity of the Northern \omega-Scorpiid meteor shower between 2010 and 2012. For this purpose we have employed an array of low-lux CCD video cameras and spectrographs deployed at different astronomical observatories in Spain. As a result of our survey, the atmospheric trajectory and radiant position of 11 of these meteor events were obtained. The tensile strength and orbital parameters of the progenitor meteoroids have been also calculated. The calculated orbital data and the behaviour of these meteoroids in the atmosphere are compatible with an asteroidal origin of this stream. In addition, we discuss a unique emission spectrum recorded for one of these meteors. This is, to our knowledge, the first North {\omega}-Scorpiid spectrum discussed in the scientific literature, and it has provided information about the chemical nature of the meteoroid and the progenitor body. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02132;A hot big bang theory: magnetic fields and the early evolution of the  protolunar disk; Charles F. Gammie,  Wei-Ting Liao,  Paul M. Ricker;  The leading theory for the formation of the Earth's moon invokes a collision between a Mars-sized body and the proto-Earth to produce a disk of orbiting material that later condenses to form the Moon. Here we study the early evolution of the protolunar disk. First, we show that the disk opacity is large and cooling is therefore inefficient (t_{cool} \Omega >> 1). In this regime angular momentum transport in the disk leads to steady heating unless \alpha < (t_{cool} \Omega)^{-1} << 1. Following earlier work by Charnoz and Michaut, and Carballido et al., we show that once the disk is completely vaporized it is well coupled to the magnetic field. We consider a scenario in which turbulence driven by magnetic fields leads to a brief, hot phase where the disk is geometrically thick, wit h strong turbulent mixing. The disk cools by spreading until it decouples from the field. We point out that approximately half the accretion energy is dissipated in the boundary layer where the disk meets the Earth's surface. This creates high entropy material close to the Earth, driving convection and mixing. Finally, a hot, magnetized disk could drive bipolar outflows that remove mass and angular momentum from the Earth-Moon system. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02167;Magnetosphere Magnetic Field Wobble Effects on the Dynamics of the  Jovian Magnetosphere; Robert M. Winglee,  Erika M. Harnett;  The Jovian magnetosphere is complicated by the multiple plasma sources and ion species present within it, as well as fast rotation with its dipole axis titled from its rotational axis. To date global models of Jovian have neglected the presence of the different ion species as well as the tilted nature of the dipole axis. This paper reports the results of the first multi-fluid global modeling of these effects in a single self-consistent study for processes occurring in the outer magnetosphere. In the inner magnetosphere the model densities are shown to be comparable to observed densities with much of the density variables due to the wobble. The wobble enables plasma to be transported to higher latitudes and then centrifugal acceleration leads to radial transport of the plasma. At the interface between the middle and outer magnetosphere, the wobble produces a sinusoidal modulation of the plasma properties, which yields at a fixed observing point two density peaks, each with the planetary period. However, because of solar wind forcing and the fast rotation of Jupiter, torques are exerted on the outer magnetospheric plasma such that the azimuthal speed between the southern and northern hemispheres are unequal. This leads to the asymmetric square wave modulation of the plasma properties in the outer magnetosphere such that only one density peak is seen each planetary period in the outer magnetosphere. This differential speed leads to reconnection in the tail at the planetary period and enhanced ejection of plasma down the tail at the planetary period. These processes could explain the periodicity seen in the New Horizons' data without the need for invoking arbitrary solar wind conditions. The energetic particles generated by these processes are shown to map to the arc-like structures seen in the dusk side auroral features. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Space Physics (physics.space-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02322;Particle dynamics in discs with turbulence generated by the vertical  shear instability; Moritz H. R. Stoll,  Wilhelm Kley;  Among the candidates for generating turbulence in accretion discs in situations with low intrinsic ionization the vertical shear instability (VSI) has become an interesting candidate, as it relies purely on a vertical gradient in the angular velocity. Existing simulations have shown that $\alpha$-values a few times $10^{-4}$ can be generated. The particle growth in the early planet formation phase is determined by the dynamics of dust particles. Here, we address in particular the efficiency of VSI-turbulence in concentrating particles in order to generate overdensities and low collision velocities. We perform 3D numerical hydrodynamical simulations of accretion discs around young stars that include radiative transport and irradiation from the central star. The motion of particles within a size range of a fraction of mm up to several m is followed using standard drag formula. We confirm that under realistic conditions the VSI is able to generate turbulence in full 3D protoplanetary discs. The irradiated disc shows turbulence within 10 to 60au. The mean radial motion of the gas is such that it is directed inward near the midplane and outward in the surface layers. We find that large particles drift inward with the expected speed, while small particles can experience phases of outward drift. Additionally, the particles show bunching behaviour with overdensities reaching 5 times the average value, which is strongest for dimensionless stopping times around unity. Particles in a VSI-turbulent discs are concentrated in large scale turbulent eddies and show low relative speeds that allow for growing collisions. The reached overdensities will also allow for the onset streaming instabilities further enhancing particle growth. The outward drift for small particles at higher disk elevations allows for the transport of processed high temperature material in the Solar System to larger distances. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Therefore, our pipeline also includes a decorrelation of this systematic noise. Our pipeline is optimised for bright stars for which spectroscopic follow-up is possible. We achieve a maximum precision on 6 hours of 6 ppm. The decorrelated light curves are searched for transits with an adapted version of the CoRoT alarm pipeline.

Both the planetary candidates and eclipsing binary candidates lists are made public to promote follow-up studies.

The planetary nature of the systems was established by performing follow-up photometric and spectroscopic observations. The follow-up data were combined with the WASP-photometry and analysed with an MCMC code to obtain system parameters. The host stars WASP-113 and WASP-114 are very similar. They are both early G-type stars with an effective temperature of $\sim 5900\,$K, [Fe/H]$\sim 0.12$ and $T_{\rm eff}$ $\sim 4.1$dex. However, WASP-113 is older than WASP-114.

WASP-113b has a mass of $0.48\,$ $\mathrm{M}_{\rm Jup}$ and an orbital period of $\sim 4.5\,$days; WASP-114b has a mass of $1.77\,$ $\mathrm{M}_{\rm Jup}$ and an orbital period of $\sim 1.5\,$days. Both planets have inflated radii, in particular WASP-113 with a radius anomaly of $\Re=0.35$. The high scale height of WASP-113b ($\sim 950$ km ) makes it a good target for follow-up atmospheric observations. ";Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Currently, none of the three proposed scenarios for their origin (intact capture of two distinct outer solar system small bodies, co-accretion with Mars, and accretion within an impact-generated disk) is able to reconcile their orbital and physical properties. Here, we investigate the expected mineralogical composition and size of the grains from which the moons once accreted assuming they formed within an impact-generated accretion disk. A comparison of our results with the present day spectral properties of the moons allows us to conclude that their building blocks cannot originate from a magma phase, thus preventing their formation in the innermost part of the disk. Instead, gas-to-solid condensation of the building blocks in the outer part of an extended gaseous disk is found as a possible formation mechanism as it does allow reproducing both the spectral and physical properties of the moons. Such a scenario may finally reconcile their orbital and physical properties alleviating the need to invoke an unlikely capture scenario to explain their physical properties. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02777;Origin of Fe3+ in Fe-containing, Al-free Mantle Silicate Perovskite; Shenzhen Xu,  Sang-Heon Shim,  Dane Morgan;  We have studied the ferrous (Fe2+) and ferric (Fe3+) iron concentrations in Al-free Fe containing Mg-silicate perovskite (Mg-Pv) at pressure (P), temperature (T), and oxygen fugacity (fO2) conditions related to the lower mantle using a thermodynamic model based on ab-initio calculations. We consider the oxidation reaction and the charge disproportionation reaction, both of which can produce Fe3+ in Mg-Pv. The model shows qualitatively good agreement with available experimental data on Fe3+/{\Sigma}Fe ({\Sigma}Fe = total Fe in system), spin transitions, and equations of state. We predict that under lower-mantle conditions Fe3+/{\Sigma}Fe determined by the charge disproportionation is estimated to be 0.01-0.07 in Al-free Mg-Pv, suggesting that low Al Mg-Pv in the uppermost pyrolitic mantle (where majoritic garnet contains most of the Al) and in the harzburgitic heterogeneities throughout the lower mantle contains very little Fe3+. We find that the volume reduction by the spin transition of the B-site Fe3+ leads to a minimum Fe3+/{\Sigma}Fe in Mg-Pv at mid-mantle pressures. The model shows that configurational entropy is a key driving force to create Fe3+ and therefore Fe3+ content is highly temperature sensitive. The temperature sensitivity may lead to a maximum Fe3+/{\Sigma}Fe in Mg-Pv in warm regions at the core-mantle boundary region, such as Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces (LLSVPs), potentially altering the physical (e.g., bulk modulus) and transport (e.g., thermal and electrical conductivities) properties of the heterogeneities. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03029;Investigating the free-floating planet mass by Euclid observations; Lindita Hamolli,  Mimoza Hafizi,  Francesco De Paolis,  Achille A. Nucita;  The detection of anomalies in gravitational microlensing events is nowadays one of the main goals among the microlensing community. In the case of single-lens events, these anomalies can be caused by the finite source effects, that is when the source disk size is not negligible, and by the Earth rotation around the Sun (the so-called parallax effect). The finite source and parallax effects may help to define the mass of the lens, uniquely. Free-floating planets (FFPs) are extremely dim objects, and gravitational microlensing provides at present the exclusive method to investigate these bodies. In this work, making use of a synthetic population algorithm, we study the possibility of detecting the finite source and parallax effects in simulated microlensing events caused by FFPs towards the Galactic bulge, taking into consideration the capabilities of the space-based Euclid telescope. We find a significant efficiency for detecting the parallax effect in microlensing events with detectable finite source effect, that turns out to be about 51% for mass function index . ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Sigurdsson;  Proxima Centauri is an M dwarf approximately 15,000 AU from the Alpha Centauri binary, comoving and likely in a loosely bound orbit. Dynamic simulations show this configuration can form from a more tightly bound triple system. As our nearest neighbors, these stars command great interest as potential planet hosts, and the dynamics of the stars govern the formation of any planets within the system. Here we present a scenario for the evolution of Alpha Centauri A and B and Proxima Centauri as a triple system. Based on N-body simulations, we determine this pathway to formation is plausible, and we quantify the implications for planet formation in the Alpha Centauri binary. We expect this formation scenario may have truncated the circumstellar disk slightly more than a system that formed in the current configuration, but that it most likely does not prevent terrestrial planet formation. We simulate planet formation in this system and find that in most scenarios, two or more terrestrial planets can be expected around either Alpha Centauri A or B, orbiting in a region out to approximately 2 AU, assuming planetesimals and planetary embryos are able to first form in the system. Additionally, terrestrial planet formation and stability in Proxima Centauri's habitable zone is also plausible. However, an absence of planets around these stars may be indicative of highly disruptive stellar dynamics in the past. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03095;Bayesian evidence for the prevalence of waterworlds; Fergus Simpson;  Should we expect most habitable planets to share the Earth's marbled appearance? For a planetary surface to boast extensive areas of both land and water, a delicate balance must be struck between the volume of water it retains and the capacity of its perturbations. These two quantities may show substantial variability across the full spectrum of water-bearing worlds. This would suggest that, barring strong feedback effects, most surfaces are heavily dominated by either water or land. Why is the Earth so finely poised? To address this question we construct a simple model for the selection bias that would arise within an ensemble of surface conditions. Based on the Earth's ocean coverage of 71%, we find substantial evidence (Bayes factor K ~ 6) supporting the hypothesis that anthropic selection effects are at work. Furthermore, due to the Earth's proximity to the waterworld limit, this model predicts that most habitable planets are dominated by oceans spanning over 90% of their surface area (95% credible interval). This scenario, in which the Earth has a much greater land area than most habitable planets, is consistent with results from numerical simulations and could help explain the apparently low-mass transition in the mass-radius relation. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO)"

Most of the proposed mechanisms explaining the dips---i.e., occulting disk warps, vortices, and forming planetesimals---assume nearly edge-on viewing geometries. However, our analysis of the three known dippers with publicly available resolved sub-mm data reveals disks with a range of inclinations, most notably the face-on transition disk J1604-2130 (EPIC 204638512). This suggests that nearly edge-on viewing geometries are not a defining characteristic of the dippers and that additional models should be explored. If confirmed by further observations of more dippers, this would point to inner disk processes that regularly produce dusty structures far above the outer disk midplane in regions relevant to planet formation.

Reiners;  Several studies have shown that the occultation of stellar active regions by the transiting planet can generate anomalies in the high-precision transit light curves, and these anomalies may lead to an inaccurate estimate of the planetary parameters (e.g., the planet radius). Since the physics and geometry behind the transit light curve and the Rossiter- McLaughlin effect (spectroscopic transit) are the same, the Rossiter-McLaughlin observations are expected to be affected by the occultation of stellar active regions in a similar way. In this paper we perform a fundamental test on the spin-orbit angles as derived by Rossiter-McLaughlin measurements, and we examine the impact of the occultation of stellar active regions by the transiting planet on the spin-orbit angle estimations. Our results show that the inaccurate estimation on the spin-orbit angle due to stellar activity can be quite significant (up to 30 degrees), particularly for the edge-on, aligned, and small transiting planets. Therefore, our results suggest that the aligned transiting planets are the ones that can be easily misinterpreted as misaligned owing to the stellar activity. In other words, the biases introduced by ignoring stellar activity are unlikely to be the culprit for the highly misaligned systems. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)"

Stevenson,  Jacob Bean,  Laura Kreidberg,  Vivien Parmentier;"  The determination of atmospheric structure and molecular abundances of planetary atmospheres via spectroscopy involves direct comparisons between models and data. While varying in sophistication, most model-spectra comparisons fundamentally assume ""1D"" model physics. However, knowledge from general circulation models and of solar system planets suggests that planetary atmospheres are inherently ""3D"" in their structure and composition. We explore the potential biases resulting from standard ""1D"" assumptions within a Bayesian atmospheric retrieval framework. Specifically, we show how the assumption of a single 1-dimensional thermal profile can bias our interpretation of the thermal emission spectrum of a hot Jupiter atmosphere that is composed of two thermal profiles. We retrieve upon spectra of unresolved model planets as observed with a combination of $HST$ WFC3+$Spitzer$ IRAC as well as $JWST$ under varying differences in the two thermal profiles. For WFC3+IRAC, there is a significantly biased estimate of CH$_4$ abundance using a 1D model when the contrast is 80%. For $JWST$, two thermal profiles are required to adequately interpret the data and estimate the abundances when contrast is greater than 40%. We also apply this preliminary concept to the recent WFC3+IRAC phase curve data of the hot Jupiter WASP-43b. We see similar behavior as present in our simulated data: while the H$_2$O abundance determination is robust, CH$_4$ is artificially well-constrained to incorrect values under the 1D assumption. Our work demonstrates the need to evaluate model assumptions in order to extract meaningful constraints from atmospheric spectra and motivates exploration of optimal observational setups.

Pietrukowicz,  R. Poleski,  J. Skowron,  I. Soszynski,  M.K. Szymanski,  K. Ulaczyk,  L. Wyrzykowski;  We report the discovery of a microlensing planet OGLE-2012-BLG-0950Lb with the planet/host mass ratio of $q \sim 2 \times 10^{-4}$. A long term distortion detected in both MOA and OGLE light curve can be explained by the microlens parallax due to the Earth's orbital motion around the Sun. Although the finite source effect is not detected, we obtain the lens flux by the high resolution Keck AO observation. Combining the microlens parallax and the lens flux reveal the nature of the lens: a planet with mass of $M_{\rm p} = 35^{+17}_{-9} M_{\oplus}$ is orbiting around a M-dwarf with mass of $M_{\rm host} = 0.56^{+0.12}_{-0.16} M_{\odot}$ with a planet-host projected separation of $r_{\perp} =2.7^{+0.6}_{-0.7}$ AU located at $D_{\rm L} = 3.0^{+0.8}_{-1.1}$ kpc from us. This is the first mass measurement from only microlens parallax and the lens flux without the finite source effect. In the coming space observation-era with $Spitzer$, $K2$, $Euclid$, and $WFIRST$, we expect many such events for which we will not be able to measure any finite source effect. This work demonstrates an ability of mass measurements in such events. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Pozuelos;  We present deep imaging observations of activated asteroid P/2016 G1 (PANSTARRS) using the 10.4m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) from late April to early June 2016. The images are best interpreted as the result of a relatively short-duration event with onset about $\mathop{350}_{-30}^{+10}$ days before perihelion (i.e., around 10th February, 2016), starting sharply and decreasing with a $\mathop{24}_{-7}^{+10}$ days (Half-width at half-maximum, HWHM). The results of the modeling imply the emission of $\sim$1.7$\times$10$^7$ kg of dust, if composed of particles of 1 micrometer to 1 cm in radius, distributed following a power-law of index --3, and having a geometric albedo of 0.15. A detailed fitting of a conspicuous westward feature in the head of the comet-like object indicates that a significant fraction of the dust was ejected along a privileged direction right at the beginning of the event, which suggests that the parent body has possibly suffered an impact followed by a partial or total disruption. From the limiting magnitude reachable with the instrumental setup, and assuming a geometric albedo of 0.15 for the parent body, an upper limit for the size of possible fragment debris of $\sim$50 m in radius is derived. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03440;Study of a Potential Relationship Between Two Long-Period Comets and  Rapid Inward Drifting of Aphelion Due to Orbital-Cascade Resonance; Zdenek Sekanina,  Rainer Kracht;  We study a potential genetic relationship of comets C/1846 O1 and C/1973 D1, whose apparent orbital similarity was tested by Kresak (1982) only statistically, using the Southworth-Hawkins (1963) criterion D. Our orbit determination for C/1846 O1 shows its period was ~500 yr, ~30 times shorter than that of C/1973 D1. Formerly unrecognized, this incongruity makes the objects' common origin less likely. Long-term orbit integration suggests that, if related, the two comets would have to have separated far away from the Sun (probably ~700 AU) 21 millennia ago and, unlike C/1973 D1, C/1846 O1 would have to have been subjected to a complex orbital evolution. Given the chance of encountering Jupiter to ~0.6 AU some 400 days after perihelion, C/1846 O1 and C/1973 D1 may have been perturbed, during their return in the 15th millennium BCE, into orbits that were, respectively, smaller and larger than was the parent's, with a net difference of more than 0.002 (AU)^{-1} in 1/a. Whereas C/1973 D1 was on the way to its 1973 perihelion, C/1846 O1 should have been subjected to recurring encounters with Jupiter, during which the orbital period continued to shorten by integral multiples of the Jovian orbital period, a process called high-order orbital-cascade resonance. While the integrated perturbation effect of C/1846 O1 by Jupiter does not appear to reduce the comet's orbital period to below ~1200 yr by the mid-19th century, we find that orbital-cascade resonance offers an attractive mechanism for rapid inward drifting of aphelion especially among dynamically new comets. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

KELT-17b is a 1.31 -0.29/+0.28 Mj, 1.525 -0.060/+0.065 Rj hot-Jupiter in a 3.08 day period orbit misaligned at -115.9 +/- 4.1 deg to the rotation axis of the star. The planet is confirmed via both the detection of the radial velocity orbit, and the Doppler tomographic detection of the shadow of the planet over two transits. The nature of the spin-orbit misaligned transit geometry allows us to place a constraint on the level of differential rotation in the host star; we find that KELT-17 is consistent with both rigid-body rotation and solar differential rotation rates (alpha < 0.30 at 2 sigma significance). KELT-17 is only the fourth A-star with a confirmed transiting planet, and with a mass of 1.635 -0.061/+0.066 Msun, effective temperature of 7454 +/- 49 K, and projected rotational velocity v sin I_* = 44.2 -1.3/+1.5 km/s; it is amongst the most massive, hottest, and most rapidly rotating of known planet hosts.

We report first photometric results from the survey which began in August, 2013. Photometric observations were performed using 1 m to 4 m class telescopes around the world. We present rotational periods and lightcurve amplitudes for 86 sub-km NEOs, though in some cases, only lower limits are provided. Our main goal is to obtain lightcurves for small NEOs (typically, sub-km objects) and estimate their rotational periods, lightcurve amplitudes, and shapes. These properties are used for statistical study to constrain overall properties of the NEO population. A weak correlation seems to indicate that smaller objects are more spherical than the larger ones. We also report 7 NEOs that are fully characterized (lightcurve and visible spectra) as the most suitable candidates for a future human or robotic mission. Viable mission targets are objects fully characterized, with a Delta_v(NHATS) <12 km s^-1, and a rotational period P>1h. Assuming a similar rate of object characterization as reported in this paper, approximately 1,230 NEOs need to be characterized in order to find 100 viable mission targets. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03602;Non-thermal production and escape of OH from the upper atmosphere of  Mars; Marko Gacesa,  Nicholas Lewkow,  Vasili Kharchenko;  We present a theoretical analysis of formation and kinetics of hot OH molecules in the upper atmosphere of Mars produced in reactions of thermal molecular hydrogen and energetic oxygen atoms. Two major sources of energetic O considered are the photochemical production, via dissociative recombination of O$_{2}^{+}$ ions, and energizing collisions with fast atoms produced by the precipitating Solar Wind (SW) ions, mostly H$^+$ and He$^{2+}$, and energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) originating in the charge-exchange collisions between the SW ions and atmospheric gases. Energizing collisions of O with atmospheric secondary hot atoms, induced by precipitating SW ions and ENAs, are also included in our consideration. The non-thermal reaction O + H$_2(v,j) \rightarrow$ H + OH$(v',j')$ is described using recent quantum-mechanical state-to-state cross sections, which allow us to predict non-equilibrium distributions of excited rotational and vibrational states $(v',j')$ of OH and expected emission spectra. A fraction of produced translationally hot OH is sufficiently energetic to overcome Mars' gravitational potential and escape into space, contributing to the hot corona. We estimate the total escape flux from dayside of Mars for low solar activity conditions at about $5\times10^{22}$ s$^{-1}$, or about 0.1\% of the total escape rate of atomic O and H. The described non-thermal OH production mechanism is general and expected to contribute to the evolution of atmospheres of the planets, satellites, and exoplanets with similar atmospheric compositions. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)"

Nonetheless, the statistics of frequency of low-mass planets hosted by low mass stars remains poorly constrained. Aims. Our M-dwarf radial velocity monitoring with HARPS-N can provide a major contribution to the widening of the current statistics through the in-depth analysis of accurate radial velocity observations in a narrow range of spectral sub-types (79 stars, between dM0 to dM3). Spectral accuracy will enable us to reach the precision needed to detect small planets with a few earth masses. Our survey will bring a contribute to the surveys devoted to the search for planets around M-dwarfs, mainly focused on the M-dwarf population of the northern emisphere, for which we will provide an estimate of the planet occurence. Methods. We present here a long duration radial velocity monitoring of the M1 dwarf star GJ 3998 with HARPS-N to identify periodic signals in the data. Almost simultaneous photometric observations were carried out within the APACHE and EXORAP programs to characterize the stellar activity and to distinguish from the periodic signals those due to activity and to the presence of planetary companions. Results. The radial velocities have a dispersion in excess of their internal errors due to at least four superimposed signals, with periods of 30.7, 13.7, 42.5 and 2.65 days. The analysis of spectral indices based on Ca II H & K and Halpha lines demonstrates that the periods of 30.7 and 42.5 days are due to chromospheric inhomogeneities modulated by stellar rotation and differential rotation. The shorter periods of 13.74 +/- 0.02 d and 2.6498 +/- 0.0008 d are well explained with the presence of two planets, with minimum masses of 6.26 +/- 0.79 MEarth and 2.47 +/- 0.27 MEarth and distances of 0.089 AU and 0.029 AU from the host, respectively. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)"

Marcussen;  The transit timing variation technique (TTV) has been widely used to detect and characterize multiple planetary systems. Due to the observational biases imposed mainly by the photometric conditions and instrumentation and the high signal-to-noise required to produce primary transit observations, ground-based data acquired using small telescopes limit the technique to the follow-up of hot Jupiters. However, space-based missions such as Kepler and CoRoT have already revealed that hot Jupiters are mainly found in single systems. Thus, it is natural to question ourselves if we are properly using the observing time at hand carrying out such follow-ups, or if the use of medium-to-low quality transit light curves, combined with current standard techniques of data analysis, could be playing a main role against exoplanetary search via TTVs. The purpose of this work is to investigate to what extent ground-based observations treated with current modelling techniques are reliable to detect and characterize additional planets in already known planetary systems. To meet this goal, we simulated typical primary transit observations of a hot Jupiter mimicing an existing system, Qatar-1. To resemble ground-based observations we attempt to reproduce, by means of physically and empirically motivated relationships, the effects caused by the Earth's atmosphere and the instrumental setup on the synthetic light curves. Therefore, the synthetic data present different photometric quality and transit coverage. In addition, we introduced a perturbation in the mid-transit times of the hot Jupiter, caused by an Earth-sized planet in a 3:2 mean motion resonance. Analyzing the synthetic light curves produced after certain epochs, we attempt to recover the synthetically added TTV signal by means of usual primary transit fitting techniques, and show how these can recover (or not) the TTV signal. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Anglada-EscudÃ©;"  We have detected excess absorption in the emission cores of Ca II H & K during transits of HD 189733b for the first time. Using observations of three transits we investigate the origin of the absorption, which is also seen in H{\alpha} and the Na I D lines. Applying differential spectrophotometry methods to the Ca II H and Ca II K lines combined, using respective passband widths of $\Delta\lambda$ = 0.4 & 0.6 \AA\ yields excess absorption of t$_d$ = 0.0074 $\pm$ 0.0044 (1.7$\sigma$; Transit 1) and 0.0214 +/- 0.0022 (9.8$\sigma$; Transit 2). Similarly, we detect excess H{\alpha} absorption in a passband of width $\Delta\lambda$ = 0.7 \AA, with t$_d$ = 0.0084 $\pm$ 0.0016 (5.2$\sigma$) and 0.0121 $\pm$ 0.0012 (9.9$\sigma$). For both lines, Transit 2 is thus significantly deeper. Combining all three transits for the Na I D lines yields excess absorption of t$_d$ = 0.0041 $\pm$ 0.0006 (6.5$\sigma$). By considering the time series observations of each line, we find that the excess apparent absorption is best recovered in the stellar reference frame. These findings lead us to postulate that the main contribution to the excess transit absorption in the differential light curves arises because the normalising continuum bands form in the photosphere, whereas the line cores contain a chromospheric component. We can not rule out that part of the excess absorption signature arises from the planetary atmosphere, but we present evidence which casts doubt on recent claims to have detected wind motions in the planet's atmosphere in these data.

Here we find the sixth example of a CO-hosting disc, around the 30Myr old A0-star HD 32297. Two more of these CO-hosting stars, HD 21997 and 49 Cet, have also been imaged in dust with SCUBA-2 within the SONS project. A census of 27 A-type debris hosts within 125 pc now shows 7/16 detections of carbon-bearing gas within the 5-50 Myr epoch, with no detections in 11 older systems. Such a prolonged period of high fragmentation rates corresponds quite well to the epoch when most of the Earth was assembled from planetesimal collisions. Recent models propose that collisional products can be spatially asymmetric if they originate at one location in the disc, with CO particularly exhibiting this behaviour as it can photodissociate in less than an orbital period. Of the six CO-hosting systems, only beta Pic is in clear support of this hypothesis. However, radiative transfer modelling with the ProDiMo code shows that the CO is also hard to explain in a proto-planetary disc context. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

During three separate campaigns, we obtained Herschel data for 24 stars at 70, 100, and 160 microns. We chose stars that were already known or suspected to have circumstellar dust based on excess infrared emission previously measured with IRAS or Spitzer, and used Herschel to examine long-wavelength properties of the dust. Fifteen stars were found to be uncontaminated by background sources, and possess infrared emission most likely due to a circumstellar debris disk. We analyzed the properties of these debris disks to better understand the physical mechanisms responsible for dust production and removal. Seven targets were spatially resolved in the Herschel images. Based on fits to their spectral energy distributions, nine disks appear to have two temperature components. Of these nine, in three cases, the warmer dust component is likely the result of a transient process rather than a steady state collisional cascade. The dust belts at four stars are likely stirred by an unseen planet, and merit further investigation. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)"

A relevant role in space debris is played by lunisolar secular resonances, which might contribute to an increase of the orbital elements, typically of the eccentricity. We concentrate our attention on the lunisolar secular resonance described by the relation $2\dot{\omega}+\dot{\Omega}=0$, where $\omega$ and $\Omega$ denote the argument of perigee and the longitude of the ascending node of the space debris. We introduce three different models with increasing complexity. We show that the growth in eccentricity, as observed in space debris located in the MEO region at the inclination about equal to $56^\circ$, can be explained as a natural effect of the secular resonance $2\dot{\omega}+\dot{\Omega}=0$, while the chaotic variations of the orbital parameters are the result of interaction and overlapping of nearby resonances. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

The physical processes leading to jet formation are under debate, with most models for cometary activity focusing on localised emission sources, such as cliffs or terraced regions. Here we suggest, by correlating high-resolution simulations of the dust environment around 67P with observations, that the anisotropy and the background dust density of 67P originate from dust released across the entire sunlit surface of the nucleus rather than from few isolated sources. We trace back trajectories from coma regions with high local dust density in space to the non-spherical nucleus and identify two mechanisms of jet formation: areas with local concavity in either two dimensions or only one. Pits and craters are examples of the first case, the neck region of the bilobed nucleus of 67P for the latter one. The conjunction of multiple sources in addition to dust released from all other sunlit areas results in a high correlation coefficient (~0.8) of the predictions with observations during a complete diurnal rotation period of 67P. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03906;Predictions of the atmospheric composition of GJ 1132b; Laura Schaefer,  Robin Wordsworth,  Zachory Berta-Thompson,  Dimitar Sasselov;  GJ 1132 b is a nearby Earth-sized exoplanet transiting an M dwarf, and is amongst the most highly characterizable small exoplanets currently known. In this paper we study the interaction of a magma ocean with a water-rich atmosphere on GJ 1132b and determine that it must have begun with more than 5 wt% initial water in order to still retain a water-based atmosphere. We also determine the amount of O2 that can build up in the atmosphere as a result of hydrogen dissociation and loss. We find that the magma ocean absorbs at most ~10% of the O2 produced, whereas more than 90% is lost to space through hydrodynamic drag. The most common outcome for GJ 1132 b from our simulations is a tenuous atmosphere dominated by O2, although for very large initial water abundances atmospheres with several thousands of bars of O2 are possible. A substantial steam envelope would indicate either the existence of an earlier H2 envelope or low XUV flux over the system's lifetime. A steam atmosphere would also imply the continued existence of a magma ocean on GJ 1132 b. Further modeling is needed to study the evolution of CO2 or N2-rich atmospheres on GJ 1132 b. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03919;Instability of mass transfer in a planet-star system; Shi Jia,  H.C. Spruit;  We show that the angular momentum exchange mechanism governing the evolution of mass transferring binary stars does not apply to Roche-lobe filling planets, because most of the angular momentum of the mass transferring stream is absorbed by the host star. Apart from a correction for the difference in specific angular momentum of the stream and the centre of mass of the planet, the orbit does not expand much on Roche-lobe overflow. We explore the conditions for dynamically unstable Roche-lobe overflow as a function of planet mass and mass and radius (age) of host star and equation of state of planet. For a Sun-like host, gas giant planets in a range of mass and entropy can undergo dynamical mass transfer. Examples of the evolution of the mass transfer process are given. Dynamic mass transfer of rocky planets depend somewhat sensitively on equation of state used. Silicate planets in the range $1 M_{\oplus} <M_{\mathrm{p}} < 10 M_{\oplus} $ typically go through a phase of dynamical mass transfer before settling to slow overflow when their mass drops to less than $1 M_{\oplus}$. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Anderson;"  Many exoplanetary systems containing hot Jupiters (HJs) exhibit significant misalignment between the spin axes of the host stars and the orbital angular momentum axes of the planets (""spin-orbit misalignment""). High-eccentricity migration involving Lidov-Kozai oscillations of the planet's orbit induced by a distant perturber is a possible channel for producing such misaligned HJ systems. Previous works have shown that the dynamical evolution of the stellar spin axis during the high-$e$ migration plays a dominant role in generating the observed spin-orbit misalignment. Numerical studies have also revealed various patterns of the evolution of the stellar spin axis leading to the final misalignment. Here we develop an analytic theory to elucidate the evolution of spin-orbit misalignment during the Lidov-Kozai migration of planets in stellar binaries. Secular spin-orbit resonances play a key role in the misalignment evolution. We include the effects of short-range forces and tidal dissipation, and categorize the different possible paths to spin-orbit misalignment as a function of various physical parameters (e.g. planet mass and stellar rotation period). We identify five distinct spin-orbit evolution paths and outcomes, only two of which are capable of producing retrograde orbits. We show that these paths to misalignment and the outcomes depend only on two dimensionless parameters, which compare the stellar spin precession frequency with the rate of change of the planet's orbital axis, and the Lidov-Kozai oscillation frequency. Our analysis reveals a number of novel phenomena for the stellar spin evolution, ranging from bifurcation, adiabatic advection, to fully chaotic evolution of spin-orbit angles.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03963;Solar Obliquity Induced by Planet Nine; Elizabeth Bailey,  Konstantin Batygin,  Michael E. Brown;  The six-degree obliquity of the sun suggests that either an asymmetry was present in the solar system's formation environment, or an external torque has misaligned the angular momentum vectors of the sun and the planets. However, the exact origin of this obliquity remains an open question. Batygin & Brown (2016) have recently shown that the physical alignment of distant Kuiper Belt orbits can be explained by a 5-20 Earth-mass planet on a distant, eccentric, and inclined orbit, with an approximate perihelion distance of ~250 AU. Using an analytic model for secular interactions between Planet Nine and the remaining giant planets, here we show that a planet with similar parameters can naturally generate the observed obliquity as well as the specific pole position of the sun's spin axis, from a nearly aligned initial state. Thus, Planet Nine offers a testable explanation for the otherwise mysterious spin-orbit misalignment of the solar system. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

At orbital separations of 15--70 au and with masses of $\approx$ 5--7 $M_{\rm J}$, HR 8799 bcde probe the extremes of jovian planet formation by core accretion: medium-resolution spectroscopy may provide clues about these planets' formation conditions.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03999;Spin-orbit Misalignment as a Driver of the Kepler Dichotomy; Christopher Spalding,  Konstantin Batygin;"  During its 5 year mission, the Kepler spacecraft has uncovered a diverse population of planetary systems with orbital configurations ranging from single-transiting planets to systems of multiple planets co-transiting the parent star. By comparing the relative occurrences of multiple to single-transiting systems, recent analyses have revealed a significant over-abundance of singles. Dubbed the ""Kepler Dichotomy,"" this feature has been interpreted as evidence for two separate populations of planetary systems: one where all orbits are confined to a single plane, and a second where the constituent planetary orbits possess significant mutual inclinations, allowing only a single member to be observed in transit at a given epoch. In this work, we demonstrate that stellar obliquity, excited within the disk-hosting stage, can explain this dichotomy. Young stars rotate rapidly, generating a significant quadrupole moment which torques the planetary orbits, with inner planets influenced more strongly. Given nominal parameters, this torque is sufficiently strong to excite significant mutual inclinations between planets, enhancing the number of single-transiting planets, sometimes through a dynamical instability. Furthermore, as hot stars appear to possess systematically higher obliquities, we predict that single-transiting systems should be relatively more prevalent around more massive stars. We analyze the Kepler data and confirm this signal to be present. ";Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04062;The Effects of Consistent Chemical Kinetics Calculations on the  Pressure-Temperature Profiles and Emission Spectra of Hot Jupiters; Benjamin Drummond,  Pascal Tremblin,  Isabelle Baraffe,  David S. Amundsen,  Nathan J. Mayne,  Olivia Venot,  Jayesh Goyal;  In this work we investigate the impact of calculating non-equilibrium chemical abundances consistently with the temperature structure for the atmospheres of highly-irradiated, close-in gas giant exoplanets. Chemical kinetics models have been widely used in the literature to investigate the chemical compositions of hot Jupiter atmospheres which are expected to be driven away from chemical equilibrium via processes such as vertical mixing and photochemistry. All of these models have so far used pressure--temperature (P-T) profiles as fixed model input. This results in a decoupling of the chemistry from the radiative and thermal properties of the atmosphere, despite the fact that in nature they are intricately linked. We use a one-dimensional radiative-convective equilibrium model, ATMO, which includes a sophisticated chemistry scheme to calculate P-T profiles which are fully consistent with non-equilibrium chemical abundances, including vertical mixing and photochemistry. Our primary conclusion is that, in cases of strong chemical disequilibrium, consistent calculations can lead to differences in the P-T profile of up to 100 K compared to the P-T profile derived assuming chemical equilibrium. This temperature change can, in turn, have important consequences for the chemical abundances themselves as well as for the simulated emission spectra. In particular, we find that performing the chemical kinetics calculation consistently can reduce the overall impact of non-equilibrium chemistry on the observable emission spectrum of hot Jupiters. Simulated observations derived from non-consistent models could thus yield the wrong interpretation. We show that this behaviour is due to the non-consistent models violating the energy budget balance of the atmosphere. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04133;A hypothesis for the color bimodality of Jupiter Trojans; Ian Wong,  Michael E. Brown;  One of the most enigmatic and hitherto unexplained properties of Jupiter Trojans is their bimodal color distribution. This bimodality is indicative of two sub-populations within the Trojans, which have distinct size distributions. In this paper, we present a simple, plausible hypothesis for the origin and evolution of the two Trojan color sub-populations. In the framework of dynamical instability models of early Solar System evolution, which suggest a common primordial progenitor population for both Trojans and Kuiper belt objects, we use observational constraints to assert that the color bimodalities evident in both minor body populations developed within the primordial population prior to the onset of instability. We show that, beginning with an initial composition of rock and ices, location-dependent volatile loss through sublimation in this primordial population could have led to sharp changes in the surface composition with heliocentric distance. We propose that the depletion or retention of H$_{2}$S ice on the surface of these objects was the key factor in creating an initial color bimodality. Objects that retained H$_{2}$S on their surfaces developed characteristically redder colors upon irradiation than those that did not. After the bodies from the primordial population were scattered and emplaced into their current positions, they preserved this primordial color bimodality to the present day. We explore predictions of the volatile loss model - in particular, the effect of collisions within the Trojan population on the size distributions of the two sub-populations - and propose further experimental and observational tests of our hypothesis ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Observations were made over about 19000 hours from May 2009 to Dec 2015. This search focused on narrow-band radio signals from a set totaling 9293 stars, including 2015 exoplanet stars and Kepler objects of interest and an additional 65 whose planets may be close to their Habitable Zone. The ATA observations were made using multiple synthesized beams and an anticoincidence filter to help identify terrestrial radio interference. Stars were observed over frequencies from 1- 9 GHz in multiple bands that avoid strong terrestrial communication frequencies. Data were processed in near-real time for narrow-band (0.7- 100 Hz) continuous and pulsed signals, with transmitter/receiver relative accelerations from -0.3 to 0.3 m/s^2. A total of 1.9 x 10^8 unique signals requiring immediate follow-up were detected in observations covering more than 8 x 10^6 star-MHz. We detected no persistent signals from extraterrestrial technology exceeding our frequency-dependent sensitivity threshold of 180 - 310 x 10^-26 W / m^2. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04260;Effects of Bulk Composition on The Atmospheric Dynamics on Close-in  Exoplanets; Xi Zhang,  Adam P. Showman;"  Super Earths and mini Neptunes likely have a wide range of atmospheric compositions, ranging from low-molecular mass atmospheres of H2 to higher molecular atmospheres of water, CO2, N2, or other species. Here, we systematically investigate the effects of atmospheric bulk compositions on temperature and wind distributions for tidally locked sub-Jupiter-sized planets, using an idealized 3D general circulation model (GCM). The bulk composition effects are characterized in the framework of two independent variables: molecular weight and molar heat capacity. The effect of molecular weight dominates. As the molecular weight increases, the atmosphere tends to have a larger day-night temperature contrast, a smaller eastward phase shift in the thermal phase curve and a smaller zonal wind speed. The width of the equatorial super-rotating jet also becomes narrower and the ""jet core"" region, where the zonal-mean jet speed maximizes, moves to a greater pressure level. The zonal-mean zonal wind is more prone to exhibit a latitudinally alternating pattern in a higher-molecular-weight atmosphere. We also present analytical theories that quantitatively explain the above trends and shed light on the underlying dynamical mechanisms. Those trends might be used to indirectly determine the atmospheric compositions on tidally locked sub-Jupiter-sized planets. The effects of the molar heat capacity are generally small. But if the vertical temperature profile is close to adiabatic, molar heat capacity will play a significant role in controlling the transition from a divergent flow in the upper atmosphere to a jet-dominated flow in the lower atmosphere.

We employ N-body simulations to determine how the time needed to clear the gap depends on the location of the gap and the mass of the planets. We invert this relation, and provide an equation for the minimum planet mass, and another for the expected number of such planets, that must be present to produce an observed gap for a star of a given age. We show how this can be combined with upper limits on the planetary system from direct imaging non-detections (such as with GPI or SPHERE) to produce approximate knowledge of the planetary system. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04659;New orbits of irregular satellites designed for the predictions of  stellar occultations up to 2020, based on thousands of new observations; A. R. Gomes-JÃºnior,  M. Assafin,  L. Beauvalet,  J. Desmars,  R. Vieira-Martins,  J. I. B. Camargo,  B. E. Morgado,  F. Braga-Ribas;  Gomes-J\'unior et al. (2015) published 3613 positions for the 8 largest irregular satellites of Jupiter and 1787 positions for the largest irregular satellite of Saturn, Phoebe. These observations were made between 1995 and 2014 and have an estimated error of about 60 to 80 mas. Based on this set of positions, we derived new orbits for the eight largest irregular satellites of Jupiter: Himalia, Elara, Pasiphae, Carme, Lysithea, Sinope, Ananke and Leda. For Phoebe we updated the ephemeris from Desmars et al. (2013) using 75% more positions than the previous one. Due to their orbital characteristics, it is common belief that the irregular satellites were captured by the giant planets in the early Solar System, but there is no consensus for a single model explaining where they were formed. Size, shape, albedo and composition would help to trace back their true origin, but these physical parameters are yet poorly known for irregular satellites. The observation of stellar occultations would allow for the determination of such parameters. Indeed Jupiter will cross the galactic plane in 2019-2020 and Saturn in 2018, improving a lot the chances of observing such events in the near future. Using the derived ephemerides and the UCAC4 catalogue we managed to identify 5442 candidate stellar occultations between January 2016 and December 2020 for the 9 satellites studied here. We discussed how the successful observation of a stellar occultation by these objects is possible and present some potential occultations. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Richardson,  Erik Asphaug;"  In this work, we analyze Jovian Trojans in the space of suitable resonant elements and we identify clusters of possible collisional origin by two independent methods: the hierarchical clustering and a so-called ""randombox"". Compared to our previous work (Bro\v{z} and Rozehnal 2011), we study a twice larger sample. Apart from Eurybates, Ennomos and $1996\,\rm RJ$ families, we have found three more clusters --- namely families around asteroids (20961)~Arkesilaos, (624)~Hektor in the $L_4$ libration zone and (247341)~$2001\,\rm UV_{209}$ in $L_5$. The families fulfill our stringent criteria, i.e. a high statistical significance, an albedo homogeneity and a steeper size-frequency distribution than that of background. In order to understand their nature, we simulate their long term collisional evolution with the Boulder code (Morbidelli et al. 2009) and dynamical evolution using a modified SWIFT integrator (Levison and Duncan, 1994). Within the framework of our evolutionary model, we were able to constrain the the age of the Hektor family to be either 1 to 4 Gyr or, less likely, 0.1 to 2.5 Gyr, depending on initial impact geometry. Since (624) Hektor itself seems to be a bilobed--shape body with a satellite (Marchis et al. 2014), i.e. an exceptional object, we address its association with the D--type family and we demonstrate that the moon and family could be created during a single impact event. We simulated the cratering event using a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH, Benz and Asphaug, 1994). This is also the first case of a family associated with a D--type parent body.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04687;A new astrobiological model of the atmosphere of Titan; Karen Willacy,  Mark Allen,  Yuk Yung;  We present results of an investigation into the formation of nitrogen-bearing molecules in the atmosphere of Titan. We extend a previous model (Li et al. 2015, 2016) to cover the region below the tropopause, so the new model treats the atmosphere from Titan's surface to an altitude of 1500 km. We consider the effects of condensation and sublimation using a continuous, numerically stable method. This is coupled with parameterized treatments of the sedimentation of the aerosols and their condensates, and the formation of haze particles. These processes affect the abundances of heavier species such as the nitrogen-bearing molecules, but have less effect on the abundances of lighter molecules. Removal of molecules to form aerosols also plays a role in determining the mixing ratios, in particular of HNC, HC3N and HCN. We find good agreement with the recently detected mixing ratios of C2H5CN, with condensation playing an important role in determining the abundance of this molecule below 500 km. Of particular interest is the chemistry of acrylonitrile (C2H3CN) which has been suggested by Stevenson et al. (2015) as a molecule that could form biological membranes in an oxygen-deficient environment. With the inclusion of haze formation we find good agreement of our model predictions of acrylonitrile with the available observations. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Tamura;  Dust trapping accelerates the coagulation of dust particles, and thus it represents an initial step toward the formation of planetesimals. We report $H$-band (1.6 um) linear polarimetric observations and 0.87 mm interferometric continuum observations toward a transitional disk around LkHa 330. As results, a pair of spiral arms were detected in the $H$-band emission and an asymmetric (potentially arm-like) structure was detected in the 0.87 mm continuum emission. We discuss the origin of the spiral arm and the asymmetric structure, and suggest that a massive unseen planet is the most plausible explanation. The possibility of dust trapping and grain growth causing the asymmetric structure was also investigated through the opacity index (beta) by plotting the observed SED slope between 0.87 mm from our SMA observation and 1.3 mm from literature. The results imply that grains are indistinguishable from ISM-like dust in the east side ($beta = 2.0 pm 0.5$), but much smaller in the west side $beta = 0.7^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$, indicating differential dust size distribution between the two sides of the disk. Combining the results of near-infrared and submillimeter observations, we conjecture that the spiral arms exist at the upper surface and an asymmetric structure resides in the disk interior. Future observations at centimeter wavelengths and differential polarization imaging in other bands (Y to K) with extreme AO imagers are required to understand how large dust grains form and to further explore the dust distribution in the disk. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04891;Planetary engulfment as a trigger for white dwarf pollution; Cristobal Petrovich,  Diego J. MuÃ±oz;"  The presence of a planetary system can shield a planetesimal disk from the secular gravitational perturbations due to distant outer massive objects (planets or stellar companions). As the host star evolves off the main sequence to become a white dwarf, these planets can be engulfed, triggering secular instabilities and leading to the tidal disruptions of small rocky bodies. These disrupted bodies can feed the white dwarfs with rocky material and possibly explain the high-metallicity material in their atmospheres. We illustrate how this mechanism can operate when the gravitational perturbations are due to the Kozai-Lidov mechanism from a stellar binary companion. We show that this mechanism can explain the observed levels of accretion if: (1) the planetary engulfment happens fast compared to the secular timescale, which is generally the case for wide binaries ($>100$ AU) and planetary engulfment during the Asymptotic Giant Branch; (2) the planetesimal disk has a total mass of $\sim10^{-4}-10^{-2}M_\oplus$. We show that this new mechanism can provide a steady supply of material throughout the entire life of the white dwarfs for all cooling ages and can account for a large fraction (up to nearly half) of the observed polluted WDs.

The host mass is not presently measured but can be determined or strongly constrained from adaptive optics imaging. The planet was discovered in a small archival study of high-magnification events in pure-survey microlensing data, which was unbiased by the presence of anomalies. The fact that it was previously unnoticed may indicate that more such planets lie in archival data and could be discovered by similar systematic study. In order to understand the transition from predominantly survey+followup to predominately survey-only planet detections, we conduct the first analysis of these detections in the observational $(s,q)$ plane. Here $s$ is projected separation in units of the Einstein radius. We find some evidence that survey+followup is relatively more sensitive to planets near the Einstein ring, but that there is no statistical difference in sensitivity by mass ratio. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.05111;The inclination of the planetary system relative to the solar equator  may be explained by the presence of Planet 9; Rodney Gomes,  Rogerio Deienno,  Alessandro Morbidelli;  We evaluate the effects of a distant planet, commonly known as planet 9, on the dynamics of the giant planets of the Solar System. We find that, given the large distance of planet 9, the dynamics of the inner giant planets can be decomposed into a classic Lagrange-Laplace dynamics relative to their own invariant plane (the plane orthogonal to their total angular momentum vector) and a slow precession of said plane relative to the total angular momentum vector of the Solar System, including planet 9. Under some specific configurations for planet 9, this precession can explain the current tilt of approximately 6 degrees between the invariant plane of the giant planets and the solar equator. An analytical model is developed to map the evolution of the inclination of the inner giant planets' invariant plane as a function of the planet 9's mass, inclination, eccentricity and semimajor axis, and some numerical simulations of the equations of motion of the giant planets and planet 9 are performed to validate our analytical approach. The longitude of the ascending node of planet 9 is found to be linked to the longitude of the ascending node of the giant planets' invariant plane, which also constrain the longitude of the node of planet 9 on the ecliptic. Some of the planet 9 configurations that allow explaining the current solar tilt are compatible with those proposed to explain the orbital confinement of the most distant Kuiper belt objects. Thus, this work on the one hand gives an elegant explanation for the current tilt between the invariant plane of the inner giant planets and the solar equator and, on the other hand, adds new constraints to the orbital elements of planet 9. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

The star is chromospherically inactive with low rotational line-broadening, ideal for radial velocity observations to measure the planets' masses. The outer planet is large enough that it likely has a thick gaseous envelope which could be studied via transmission spectroscopy.

Linfield;  We present an analysis of surveying the inner Solar System for objects that may pose some threat to the Earth. Most of the analysis is based on understanding the capability provided by Sentinel, a concept for an infrared space-based telescope placed in a heliocentric orbit near the distance of Venus. From this analysis, we show 1) the size range being targeted can affect the survey design, 2) the orbit distribution of the target sample can affect the survey design, 3) minimum observational arc length during the survey is an important metric of survey performance, and 4) surveys must consider objects as small as D=15-30 m to meet the goal of identifying objects that have the potential to cause damage on Earth in the next 100 years. Sentinel will be able to find 50% of all impactors larger than 40 meters in a 6.5 year survey. The Sentinel mission concept is shown to be as effective as any survey in finding objects bigger than D=140 m but is more effective when applied to finding smaller objects on Earth-impacting orbits. Sentinel is also more effective at finding objects of interest for human exploration that benefit from lower propulsion requirements. To explore the interaction between space and ground search programs, we also study a case where Sentinel is combined with the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and show the benefit of placing a space-based observatory in an orbit that reduces the overlap in search regions with a ground-based telescope. In this case, Sentinel+LSST can find more than 70% of the impactors larger than 40 meters assuming a 6.5 year lifetime for Sentinel and 10 years for LSST. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM)"

We distill these candidates into sets of 104 validated planets (57 in multi-planet systems), 30 false positives, and 63 remaining candidates. Our validated systems span a range of properties, with median values of R_P = 2.3 R_E, P=8.6 d, Tef = 5300 K, and Kp=12.7 mag. Stellar spectroscopy provides precise stellar and planetary parameters for most of these systems. We show that K2 has increased by 30% the number of small planets known to orbit moderately bright stars (1-4 R_E, Kp=9-13 mag). Of particular interest are 37 planets smaller than 2 R_E, 15 orbiting stars brighter than Kp=11.5, five receiving Earth-like irradiation levels, and several multi-planet systems -- including four planets orbiting the M dwarf K2-72 near mean-motion resonances. By quantifying the likelihood that each candidate is a planet we demonstrate that our candidate sample has an overall false positive rate of 15-30%, with rates substantially lower for small candidates (< 2 R_E) and larger for candidates with radii > 8 R_E and/or with P < 3 d. Extrapolation of the current planetary yield suggests that K2 will discover between 500-1000 planets in its planned four-year mission -- assuming sufficient follow-up resources are available. Efficient observing and analysis, together with an organized and coherent follow-up strategy, is essential to maximize the efficacy of planet-validation efforts for K2, TESS, and future large-scale surveys. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

";  A principal scientific goal of the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) is obtaining milliarcsecond astrometry to constrain exoplanet orbits. However, astrometry of directly imaged exoplanets is subject to biases, systematic errors, and speckle noise. Here we describe an analytical procedure to forward model the signal of an exoplanet that accounts for both the observing strategy (angular and spectral differential imaging) and the data reduction method (Karhunen-Lo\`eve Image Projection algorithm). We use this forward model to measure the position of an exoplanet in a Bayesian framework employing Gaussian processes and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to account for correlated noise. In the case of GPI data on $\beta$ Pic b, this technique, which we call Bayesian KLIP-FM Astrometry (BKA), outperforms previous techniques and yields 1$\sigma$-errors at or below the one milliarcsecond level. We validate BKA by fitting a Keplerian orbit to twelve GPI observations along with previous astrometry from other instruments. The statistical properties of the residuals confirm that BKA is accurate and correctly estimates astrometric errors. Our constraints on the orbit of $\beta$ Pic b firmly rule out the possibility of a transit of the planet at 10-$\sigma$ significance. However, we confirm that the Hill sphere of $\beta$ Pic b will transit, giving us a rare chance to probe the circumplanetary environment of a young, evolving exoplanet. We provide an ephemeris for photometric monitoring of the Hill sphere transit event, which will begin at the start of April in 2017 and finish at the end of January in 2018. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Parks,  Rui Wang,  Quanming Lu,  Huidong Hu;  We carry out two-dimensional global particle-in-cell simulations of the interaction between the solar wind and a dipole field to study the formation of the bow shock and magnetosphere. A self-reforming bow shock ahead of a dipole field is presented by using relatively high temporal-spatial resolutions. We find that (1) the bow shock and the magnetosphere are formed and reach a quasi-stable state after several ion cyclotron periods, and (2) under the Bz southward solar wind condition the bow shock undergoes a self-reformation for low \b{eta}i and high MA. Simultaneously, a magnetic reconnection in the magnetotail is found. For high \b{eta}i and low MA, the shock becomes quasi-stationary, and the magnetotail reconnection disappears. In addition, (3) the magnetopause deflects the magnetosheath plasmas. The sheath particles injected at the quasi-perpendicular region of the bow shock can be convected to downstream of an oblique shock region. A fraction of these sheath particles can leak out from the magnetosheath at the wings of the bow shock. Hence, the downstream situation is more complicated than that for a planar shock produced in local simulations. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Space Physics (physics.space-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.05535;THOR: A New and Flexible Global Circulation Model to Explore Planetary  Atmospheres; JoÃ£o M. MendonÃ§a,  Simon L. Grimm,  Luc Grosheintz,  Kevin Heng;"  We have designed and developed, from scratch, a global circulation model named THOR that solves the three-dimensional non-hydrostatic Euler equations. Our general approach lifts the commonly used assumptions of a shallow atmosphere and hydrostatic equilibrium. We solve the ""pole problem"" (where converging meridians on a sphere lead to increasingly smaller time steps near the poles) by implementing an icosahedral grid. Irregularities in the grid, which lead to grid imprinting, are smoothed using the ""spring dynamics"" technique. We validate our implementation of spring dynamics by examining calculations of the divergence and gradient of test functions. To prevent the computational time step from being bottlenecked by having to resolve sound waves, we implement a split-explicit method together with a horizontally explicit and vertically implicit integration. We validate our global circulation model by reproducing the Earth and also the hot Jupiter-like benchmark tests. THOR was designed to run on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), which allows for physics modules (radiative transfer, clouds, chemistry) to be added in the future, and is part of the open-source Exoclimes Simulation Platform (ESP; www.exoclime.org).

Vincent;  The Wide Angle Camera of the OSIRIS instrument on board the Rosetta spacecraft is equipped with several narrowband filters that are centered on the emission lines and bands of various fragment species. These are used to determine the evolution of the production and spatial distribution of the gas in the inner coma of comet 67P with time and heliocentric distance, here between 2.6 - 1.3 AU pre-perihelion. Our observations indicate that the emission observed in the OH, OI, CN, NH, and NH2 filters is mostly produced by dissociative electron impact excitation of different parent species. We conclude that CO2 rather than H2O is a significant source of the [OI] 630 nm emission. A strong plume-like feature observed in the in CN and [OI] filters is present throughout our observations. This plume is not present in OH emission and indicates a local enhancement of the CO2/H2O ratio by as much as a factor of 3. We observed a sudden decrease in intensity levels after March 2015, which we attribute to decreased electron temperatures in the first kilometers above the nucleus surface. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.05633;Finding Planet Nine: apsidal anti-alignment Monte Carlo results; C. de la Fuente Marcos,  R. de la Fuente Marcos;  The distribution of the orbital elements of the known extreme trans-Neptunian objects or ETNOs has been found to be statistically incompatible with that of an unperturbed asteroid population following heliocentric or, better, barycentric orbits. Such trends, if confirmed by future discoveries of ETNOs, strongly suggest that one or more massive perturbers could be located well beyond Pluto. Within the trans-Plutonian planets paradigm, the Planet Nine hypothesis has received much attention as a robust scenario to explain the observed clustering in physical space of the perihelia of seven ETNOs which also exhibit clustering in orbital pole position. Here, we revisit the subject of clustering in perihelia and poles of the known ETNOs using barycentric orbits, and study the visibility of the latest incarnation of the orbit of Planet Nine applying Monte Carlo techniques and focusing on the effects of the apsidal anti-alignment constraint. We provide visibility maps indicating the most likely location of this putative planet if it is near aphelion. We also show that the available data suggest that at least two massive perturbers are present beyond Pluto. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

Durantini Luca,  Michiharu Hyogo,  Lily Lau Wan Wah,  Art Piipuu,  Fernanda PiÃ±eiro;  The Disk Detective citizen science project aims to find new stars with 22 micron excess emission from circumstellar dust using data from NASA's WISE mission. Initial cuts on the AllWISE catalog provide an input catalog of 277,686 sources. Volunteers then view images of each source online in 10 different bands to identify false-positives (galaxies, background stars, interstellar matter, image artifacts, etc.). Sources that survive this online vetting are followed up with spectroscopy on the FLWO Tillinghast telescope. This approach should allow us to unleash the full potential of WISE for finding new debris disks and protoplanetary disks. We announce a first list of 37 new disk candidates discovered by the project, and we describe our vetting and follow-up process. One of these systems appears to contain the first debris disk discovered around a star with a white dwarf companion: HD 74389. We also report four newly discovered classical Be stars (HD 6612, HD 7406, HD 164137, and HD 218546) and a new detection of 22 micron excess around a previously known debris disk host star, HD 22128. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.05734;Close-in planetesimal formation by pile-up of drifting pebbles; Joanna Drazkowska,  Yann Alibert,  Ben Moore;  The consistency of planet formation models suffers from the disconnection between the regime of small and large bodies. This is primarily caused by so-called growth barriers: the direct growth of larger bodies is halted at centimetre-sized objects and particular conditions are required for the formation of larger, gravitationally bound planetesimals. We aim to connect models of dust evolution and planetesimal formation to identify regions of protoplanetary discs that are favourable for the formation of kilometre-sized bodies and the first planetary embryos. We combine semi-analytical models of viscous protoplanetary disc evolution, dust growth and drift including backreaction of the dust particles on the gas, and planetesimal formation via the streaming instability into one numerical code. We investigate how planetesimal formation is affected by the mass of the protoplanetary disc, its initial dust content, and the stickiness of dust aggregates. We find that the dust growth and drift leads to a global redistribution of solids. The pile-up of pebbles in the inner disc provides local conditions where the streaming instability is effective. Planetesimals form in an annulus with its inner edge lying between 0.3 AU and 1 AU and its width ranging from 0.3 AU to 3 AU. The resulting surface density of planetesimals follows a radial profile that is much steeper than the initial disc profile. These results support formation of terrestrial planets in the solar system from a narrow annulus of planetesimals, which reproduces their peculiar mass ratios. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

We present ALMA Band 7 (335 GHz or 0.89 mm) continuum observations of the transition disk HD135344B at unprecedented spatial resolution of 0.16"", using superuniform weighting. The data show that the asymmetric millimeter dust ring seen in previous work actually consists of an inner ring and an outer asymmetric structure. The outer feature is cospatial with the end of one of the spiral arms seen in scattered light, but the feature itself is not consistent with a spiral arm due to its coradiance. We propose a new possible scenario to explain the observed structures at both wavelengths. Hydrodynamical simulations show that a massive planet can generate a primary vortex (which dissipates at longer timescales, becoming an axisymmetric ring) and trigger the formation of a second generation vortex further out. Within this scenario the two spiral arms observed at scattered light originate from a planet at ~30 AU and from the secondary vortex at ~75 AU rather than a planet further out as previously reported.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.05797;Upper limits to the number of Oort Cloud Objects based on serendipitous  occultation events search in X-rays; Hsiang-Kuang Chang,  Chih-Yuan Liu,  Jie-Rou Shang;  Using all the RXTE archival data of Sco X-1 and GX 5-1, which amount to about 1.6 mega seconds in total, we searched for possible occultation events caused by Oort Cloud Objects. The detection efficiency of our searching approach was studied with simulation. Our search is sensitive to object size of about 300 m in the inner Oort Cloud, taking 4000 AU as a representative distance, and of 900 m in the outer Oort Cloud, taking 36000 AU as the representative distance. No occultation events were found in the 1.6 Ms data. We derived upper limits to the number of Oort Cloud Objects, which are about three orders of magnitude higher than the highest theoretical estimates in the literature for the inner Oort Cloud, and about six orders higher for the outer Oort Cloud. Although these upper limits are not constraining enough, they are the first obtained observationally, without making any model assumptions about comet injection. They also provide guidance to such serendipitous occultation event search in the future. ;"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM)"

Szegedi-Elek,  P. Szekely,  K. Vida,  J. Vinko,  L.L. Kiss;  Remote investigations of the ancient solar system matter has been traditionally carried out through the observations of long-period (LP) comets that are less affected by solar irradiation than the short-period counterparts orbiting much closer to the Sun. Here we summarize the results of our decade-long survey of the distant activity of LP comets. We found that the most important separation in the dataset is based on the dynamical nature of the objects. Dynamically new comets are characterized by a higher level of activity on average: the most active new comets in our sample can be characterized by afrho values >3--4 higher than that of our most active returning comets. New comets develop more symmetric comae, suggesting a generally isotropic outflow. Contrary to this, the coma of recurrent comets can be less symmetrical, ocassionally exhibiting negative slope parameters, suggesting sudden variations in matter production. The morphological appearance of the observed comets is rather diverse. A surprisingly large fraction of the comets have long, teniouos tails, but the presence of impressive tails does not show a clear correlation with the brightness of the comets. ;Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
