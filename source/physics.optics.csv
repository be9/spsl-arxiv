https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00036;Chromatic control in coextruded layered polymer microlenses; Michael Crescimanno,  Tom N. Oder,  James H. Andrews,  Chuanhong Zhou,  Joshua B. Petrus,  Cory Merlo,  Cameron Bagheri,  Connor Hetzel,  James Tancabel,  Kenneth D. Singer,  Eric Baer;  We describe the formation, characterization and theoretical understanding of microlenses comprised of alternating polystyrene and polymethylmethacrylate layers produced by multilayer coextrusion. These lenses are fabricated by photolithography, using a grayscale mask followed by plasma etching, so that the refractive index alternation of the bilayer stack appears across the radius of the microlens. The alternating quarter-wave thick layers form a one-dimensional photonic crystal whose dispersion augments the material dispersion, allowing one to sculpt the chromatic dispersion of the lens by adjusting the layered structure. Using Huygen's principle, we model our experimental measurements of the focal length of these lenses across the reflection band of the multilayer polymer film from which the microlens is fashioned. For a 56 micron diameter multilayered lens of focal length 300 microns, we measured a nearly 25 percent variation in the focal length across a shallow, 50 nm-wide reflection band. ;Optics (physics.optics)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00084;Designing an ultra negative dispersion Photonic Crystal Fiber (PCFs)  with square lattice geometry; Partha Sona Maji,  Partha Roy Chaudhuri;  In this article we have theoretically investigated the dispersion characteristics of dual-core PCF, based on square-lattice geometry by varying different parameters. The fiber exhibits a very large negative dispersion because of rapid slope change of the refractive indices at the coupling wavelength between the inner core and outer core. The dependence of different geometrical parameters namely hole-to-hole spacing (pitch) and different air-hole diameter (d) was investigated in detail. By proper adjustment of the available parameters, a high negative dispersion value of -47,500 ps/nm/km has been achieved around the wavelength of 1550nm. Our proposed fiber will be an excellent device for dispersion compensation in long-haul data transmission as being thousand times more than the available DCFs. ;Optics (physics.optics)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00117;Rational design of metallic nanocavities for resonantly enhanced  four-wave mixing; Euclides Almeida,  Yehiam Prior;"  Optimizing the shape of nanostructures and nano antennas for specific optical properties has evolved to be a very fruitful activity. With modern fabrication tools a large variety of possibilities is available for shaping both nanoparticles and nanocavities; in particular nanocavities in thin metal films have emerged as attractive candidates for new metamaterials and strong linear and nonlinear optical systems. Here we rationally design metallic nanocavities to boost their Four Wave Mixing response by resonating the optical plasmonic resonances with the incoming and generated beams. The linear and nonlinear optical responses as well as the propagation of the electric fields inside the cavities are derived from the solution of Maxwell equations by using the 3D finite-differences time domain method. The observed conversion-efficiency of near infra-red to visible light equals or surpasses that of BBO of equivalent thickness. Implications to further optimization for efficient and broadband ultrathin nonlinear optical materials are discussed. ";Optics (physics.optics)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00272;Intra-cavity gain shaping of mode-locked Ti:Sapphire laser oscillations; Shai Yefet,  Na'aman Amer,  Avi Pe'er;  The gain properties of an oscillator strongly affect its behavior. When the gain is homogeneous, different modes compete for gain resources in a `winner takes all' manner, whereas with inhomogeneous gain, modes can coexist if they utilize different gain resources. We demonstrate precise control over the mode competition in a mode locked Ti:sapphire oscillator by manipulation and spectral shaping of the gain properties, thus steering the competition towards a desired, otherwise inaccessible, oscillation. Specifically, by adding a small amount of spectrally shaped inhomogeneous gain to the standard homogeneous gain oscillator, we selectively enhance a desired two-color oscillation, which is inherently unstable to mode competition and could not exist in a purely homogeneous gain oscillator. By tuning the parameters of the additional inhomogeneous gain we flexibly control the center wavelengths, relative intensities and widths of the two colors. ;Optics (physics.optics)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00351;Thermally Induced Nonlinear Optical Absorption in Metamaterial Perfect  Absorbers; Sriram Guddala,  Raghwendra Kumar,  S. Anantha Ramakrishna;  A metamaterial perfect absorber consisting of a tri-layer (Al/ZnS/Al) metal-dielectric-metal system with top aluminium nano-disks is fabricated by laser-interference lithography and lift-off processing. The metamaterial absorber had peak resonant absorbance at 1090 nm and showed nonlinear absorption for 600ps laser pulses at 1064 nm wavelength. A nonlinear saturation of reflectance was measured to be dependent on the average laser power incident and not the peak laser intensity. The nonlinear behaviour is shown to arise from the heating due to the absorbed radiation and photo-thermal changes in the dielectric properties of aluminium. The metamaterial absorber is seen to be damage resistant at large laser intensities of 25 MW/cm2. ;Optics (physics.optics)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00382;Periodic transmission peaks in non-periodic disordered one-dimensional  photonic structures; Ilka Kriegel,  Francesco Scotognella;  A better understanding of the optical properties of a device structure characterized by a random arrangement of materials with different dielectric properties at a length scale comparable to the wavelength of light is crucial for the realization of new optical and optoelectronic devices. Here we have studied the light transmission of disordered photonic structures made with two and three different materials, characterized by the same optical thickness. In their transmission spectra a formation of peaks, with a transmission of up to 75%, is evident. The spectral position of such peaks is very regular, which is a result of the constraint that all layers have the same optical thickness. This gives rise to a manifold of applications such as new types of bandpass filters and resonators for distributed feedback lasers. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Orlov,  Ivan Iorsh,  Pavel A. Belov,  Yuri S. Kivshar,  Anatoly V. Zayats;  Concealing objects by making them invisible to an external electromagnetic probe is coined by the term cloaking. Cloaking devices, having numerous potential applications, are still face challenges in realization, especially in the visible spectral range. In particular, inherent losses and extreme parameters of metamaterials required for the cloak implementation are the limiting factors. Here, we numerically demonstrate nearly perfect suppression of scattering from arbitrary shaped objects in spatially dispersive metamaterial acting as an alignment-free concealing cover. We consider a realization of a metamaterial as a metal-dielectric multilayer and demonstrate suppression of scattering from an arbitrary object in forward and backward directions with perfectly preserved wavefronts and less than 10% absolute intensity change, despite spatial dispersion effects present in the composite metamaterial. Beyond the usual scattering suppression applications, the proposed configuration may serve as a simple realisation of scattering-free detectors and sensors. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Antonov,  F.G. Vagizov,  R. N. Shakhmuratov,  Olga Kocharovskaya;  An efficient technique to produce a periodic sequence of ultrashort pulses of recoilless gamma-radiation via its transmission through the optically thick vibrating resonant absorber was demonstrated recently [Nature, 508, 80 (2014)]. In this work we extend the theoretical analysis to the case of a set of multiple absorbers. We consider an analytical model describing the control of spectral content of a frequency modulated gamma-radiation by selective correction of amplitudes and initial phases of some spectral components, using, respectively, the resonant absorption or dispersion of nuclei. On the basis of the analytical solutions we determine the ultimate possibilities of the proposed technique. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00545;Prospects and merits of metal-clad semiconductor lasers from nearly UV  to far IR; Jacob B. Khurgin;  Using metal-clad (or plasmonic) waveguide structures in semiconductor lasers carries a promise of reduced size, threshold, and power consumption. This promise is put to a rigorous theoretical test, that takes into account increased waveguide loss, Auger recombination, and Purcell enhancement of spontaneous recombination. The conclusion is that purported benefits of metal waveguides are small to nonexistent for all the band-to-band and intersubband lasers operating from UV to Mid-IR range, with a prominent exception of far-IR and THz quantum cascade lasers. For these devices, however, metal waveguides already represent the state of the art, and the guiding mechanism in them has far more in common with a ubiquitous transmission line than with plasmonics. ;Optics (physics.optics)

I show here that the great flexibility of this technology can allow the design and fabrication of hollow core optical fibers with an extended transmission bandwidth in the near infrared and with very low optical attenuation in the visible wavelength regime.

Anagnostou;  We introduce an efficient computational scheme based on Macro Basis Function (MBF) method, to analyze the scattering of a plane wave by the V-shaped plasmonic optical nano-antennas. The polarization currents and the scattered fields for symmetric and anti-symmetric excitations are investigated. We investigate how the resonant frequency of the plasmonic V-shaped nanoantenna is tailored by engineering the geometrical parameters and by changing the polarization state of the incident plane wave. The computational model presented herein is faster by orders of magnitude than commercially available finite methods and is capable to characterize also other nanoantennas comprising of junctions and bends of nanorods. ;Optics (physics.optics)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00767;The origin of the Redshift Spikes in the reflection spectrum of a  Few-cycle Pulse in a Dense Medium; Yue-Yue Chen,  Xun-Li Feng,  Zhi-Zhan Xu,  Chengpu Liu;  We give a detailed description about the reflected spectrum of a few-cycle pulse propagating through a resonant dense medium. An unexpected low-frequency spike appeared in the red edge of the spectrum. To figure out the origin of this redshift spike, we analysis the mechanisms responsible for the redshift of the reflected field. So far, the redshift has not been well studied for few-cycle pulses except a brief explanation made by the previous study [Kaloshan et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 83 544 (1999).], which attributed the origin of the redshift to the so-called intrapulse four-wave mixing. However, we demonstrate numerically that the redshift consists of two separated spikes is actually produced by the Doppler effect of backpropagation waves, which is an analogue effect of dynamic nonlinear optical skin effect. Our study elucidates the underlying physics of the dynamic nonlinear optical effects responsible for the redshift spikes. Moreover, the dependency of the their frequency on the laser and medium parameters, such as medium density and input pulse area are also discussed. ;Optics (physics.optics)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00854;Stabilization of three-wave vortex beams in the waveguide; Arnaldo Gammal,  Boris A. Malomed;  We consider two-dimensional (2D) localized vortical modes in the three-wave system with the quadratic ($\chi ^{(2)}$) nonlinearity, alias nondegenerate second-harmonic-generating system, guided by the isotropic harmonic-oscillator (HO) (alias parabolic) confining potential. In addition to the straightforward realization in optics, the system models mixed atomic-molecular Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). The main issue is stability of the vortex modes, which is investigated through computation of instability growth rates for eigenmodes of small perturbations, and by means of direct simulations. The threshold of parametric instability for single-color beams, represented solely by the second harmonic (SH) with zero vorticity, is found in an analytical form with the help of the variational approximation (VA). Trapped states with vorticities $\left( +1,-1,0\right) $ in the two fundamental-frequency (FF) components and the SH one [the so-called \textit{hidden-vorticity} (HV) modes] are completely unstable. Also unstable are \textit{semi-vortices} (SVs), with component vorticities $% \left( 1,0,1\right) $. However, full vortices, with charges $\left( 1,1,2\right) $, have a well-defined stability region. Unstable full vortices feature regions of robust dynamical behavior, where they periodically split and recombine, keeping their vortical content. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01005;Conservation of reactive electromagnetic energy in reactive time; Gerald Kaiser;  The complex Poynting theorem (CPT) is extended to a canonical time-scale domain $(t,s)$. Time-harmonic phasors are replaced by the positive-frequency parts of general fields, which extend analytically to complex time $t+is$, with $s>0$ interpreted as a time resolution scale. The real part of the extended CPT gives conservation in $t$ of a time-averaged field energy, and its imaginary part gives conservation in $s$ of a time-averaged reactive energy. In both cases, the averaging windows are determined by a Cauchy kernel of width $\Delta t\sim \pm s$. This completes the time-harmonic CPT, whose imaginary part is generally supposed to be vaguely `related to' reactive energy without giving a conservation law, or even an expression, for the latter. The interpretation of $s$ as reactive time, tracking the leads and lags associated with stored capacitative and inductive energy, gives a simple explanation of the volt-ampere reactive (var) unit measuring reactive power: a var is simply one Joule per reactive second. The related 'complex radiation impedance density' is introduced to represent the field's local reluctance to radiate. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01015;Superlinear growth of Rayleigh scattering-induced intensity noise in  single-mode fibers; James P. Cahill,  Olukayode Okusaga,  Weimin Zhou,  Curtis R. Menyuk,  Gary M. Carter;  Rayleigh scattering generates intensity noise close to an optical carrier that propagates in a single-mode optical fiber. This noise degrades the performance of optoelectronic oscillators and RF-photonic links. When using a broad linewidth laser, we previously found that the intensity noise power scales linearly with optical power and fiber length, which is consistent with guided entropy mode Rayleigh scattering (GEMRS), a third order nonlinear scattering process, in the spontaneous limit. In this work, we show that this behavior changes significantly with the use of a narrow linewidth laser. Using a narrow linewidth laser, we measured the bandwidth of the intensity noise plateau to be 10 kHz. We found that the scattered noise power scales superlinearly with fiber length up to lengths of 10 km in the frequency range of 500 Hz to 10 kHz, while it scales linearly in the frequency range of 10 Hz to 100 Hz. These results suggest that the Rayleigh-scattering-induced intensity noise cannot be explained by third-order nonlinear scattering in the spontaneous limit, as previously hypothesized. ;Optics (physics.optics)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01089;Fast Super-Resolution Imaging with Ultra-High Labeling Density Achieved  by Joint Tagging Super-Resolution Optical Fluctuation Imaging (JT-SOFI); Zhiping Zeng,  Xuanze Chen,  Hening Wang,  Ning Huang,  Chunyan Shan,  Hao Zhang,  Junlin Teng,  Peng Xi;  Previous stochastic localization-based super-resolution techniques are largely limited by the labeling density and the fidelity to the morphology of specimen. We report on an optical super-resolution imaging scheme implementing joint tagging using multiple fluorescent blinking dyes associated with super-resolution optical fluctuation imaging (JT-SOFI), achieving ultra-high labeling density super-resolution imaging. To demonstrate the feasibility of JT-SOFI, quantum dots with different emission spectra were jointly labeled to the tubulin in COS7 cells, creating ultra-high density labeling. After analyzing and combining the fluorescence intermittency images emanating from spectrally resolved quantum dots, the microtubule networks are capable of being investigated with high fidelity and remarkably enhanced contrast at sub-diffraction resolution. The spectral separation also significantly decreased the frame number required for SOFI, enabling fast super-resolution microscopy through simultaneous data acquisition. As the joint-tagging scheme can decrease the labeling density in each spectral channel, we can faithfully reflect the continuous microtubule structure with high resolution through collection of only 100 frames per channel. The improved continuity of the microtubule structure is quantitatively validated with image skeletonization, thus demonstrating the advantage of JT-SOFI over other localization-based super-resolution methods. ;Optics (physics.optics)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01421;Energy flux pattern of inverse Goos-Hanchen shift in photonic crystals  with negative index of refraction; Jinbing Hu,  Binming Liang,  Jiabi Chen,  Qiang Jiang,  Yan Wang,  Songlin Zhuang;  The energy flux patterns of inverse Goos-Hanchen (GH) shift around the interface between air and negatively refractive photonic crystal (NRPhC) with different surface terminations is investigated. Results show that NRPhC exhibits inverse GH shift in TM and TE polarization, and the localization and pattern of energy flux differ in TM and TE polarizations and are strongly affected by surface termination. This is different to the condition of negative permittivity materials (i.e., metal), which only presents inverse GH shift in TM polarization. In the case of TE polarization, the energy flux pattern exhibits the flux of backward wave whose localization changes from the surface to inside of NRPhC with the variation of surface termination. In the case of TM polarization, the energy flux pattern is always confined within the surface of NRPhC, whereas its pattern changes from the flux of backward wave to vortices at the surface of NRPhC, which is different to the energy flux of TM polarization of metal. By properly truncating the surface of NRPhC we can control the magnitude of inverse GH shift for TM and TE polarized light. ;Optics (physics.optics)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01423;Cavity ring-up spectroscopy for ultrafast sensing with optical  microresonators; Serge Rosenblum,  Yulia Lovsky,  Lior Arazi,  Frank Vollmer,  Barak Dayan;  Spectroscopy of whispering-gallery mode (WGM) microresonators has become a powerful scientific tool, enabling detection of single viruses, nanoparticles, and even single molecules. Yet the demonstrated timescale of these schemes has been limited so far to milliseconds or more. Here we introduce a novel scheme that is orders of magnitude faster, capable of capturing complete spectral snapshots of WGM resonances at nanosecond timescales: cavity ring-up spectroscopy (CRUS). Based on sharply-rising detuned probe pulses, CRUS combines the sensitivity of heterodyne measurements with the highest possible, transform-limited acquisition rate. As a demonstration we capture spectra of microtoroid resonators at time intervals as short as 16 ns, directly monitoring sub-microsecond dynamics of their optomechanical vibrations, thermorefractive response and Kerr nonlinearity. CRUS holds promise for the study of fast biological processes such as enzyme kinetics, protein folding and light harvesting, with applications in other fields such as cavity QED and pulsed optomechanics. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01454;Novel laser machining of optical fibers for long cavities with low  birefringence; Hiroki Takahashi,  Jack Morphew,  Fedja Orucevic,  Atsushi Noguchi,  Ezra Kassa,  Matthias Keller;  We present a novel method of machining optical fiber surfaces with a CO${}_2$ laser for use in Fiber-based Fabry-Perot Cavities (FFPCs). Previously FFPCs were prone to large birefringence and limited to relatively short cavity lengths ($\le$ 200 $\mu$m). These characteristics hinder their use in some applications such as cavity quantum electrodynamics with trapped ions. We optimized the laser machining process to produce large, uniform surface structures. This enables the cavities to achieve high finesse even for long cavity lengths. By rotating the fibers around their axis during the laser machining process the asymmetry resulting from the laser's transverse mode profile is eliminated. Consequently we are able to fabricate fiber mirrors with a high degree of rotational symmetry, leading to remarkably low birefringence. Through measurements of the cavity finesse over a range of cavity lengths and the polarization dependence of the cavity linewidth, we confirmed the quality of the produced fiber mirrors for use in low-birefringence FFPCs. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

The basic equations describing the amplitudes of the magnetic field and current in the split-ring resonators are developed. These yield in the linear approximation the reflection and transmission coefficients. The polarization of the reflected wave is independent of the frequency of the incident wave and of its polarization; it is defined only by the orientation of the split-ring. The reflection and transmission coefficients have a strong resonance that is determined by the parameters of the rf-SQUID; its strength depends essentially on the incident angle.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01542;Parametric Instability in Long Optical Cavities and Suppression by  Dynamic Transverse Mode Frequency Modulation; Chunnong Zhao,  Li Ju,  Qi Fang,  Carl Blair,  Jiayi Qin,  David Blair,  Jerome Degallaix,  Hiroaki Yamamoto;  Three mode parametric instability has been predicted in Advanced gravitational wave detectors. Here we present the first observation of this phenomenon in a large scale suspended optical cavity designed to be comparable to those of advanced gravitational wave detectors. Our results show that previous modelling assumptions that transverse optical modes are stable in frequency except for frequency drifts on a thermal deformation time scale is unlikely to be valid for suspended mass optical cavities. We demonstrate that mirror figure errors cause a dependence of transverse mode offset frequency on spot position. Combined with low frequency residual motion of suspended mirrors, this leads to transverse mode frequency modulation which suppresses the effective parametric gain. We show that this gain suppression mechanism can be enhanced by laser spot dithering or fast thermal modulation. Using Advanced LIGO test mass data and thermal modelling we show that gain suppression factors of 10-20 could be achieved for individual modes, sufficient to greatly ameliorate the parametric instability problem. ;"Optics (physics.optics); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)"

The cavity-enhanced system provides a means to reach suitable intensities to study field-free molecular alignment and enhance the observable effects of the molecule-field interaction. We observe modulations of the driving field, arising from the nature of impulsive stimulated Raman scattering responsible for coherent molecular rotations.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01920;A Theoretical Investigation of Decay and Energy Transfer Rates and  Efficiencies Near Gold Nanospheres; Cristian A. Marocico,  Xia Zhang,  A. Louise Bradley;"  We consider the effect of Au nanospheres of subwavelength sizes on the decay and energy transfer rates of quantum systems placed in the proximity of these nanospheres. We find that, for the sphere sizes considered in this contribution, the radiative decay rate is barely affected by the presence of the nanosphere, whereas the non-radiative decay rate is greatly enhanced due to energy transfer from the quantum system to the nanosphere, leading to a strong quenching of the emission of the quantum system. The emission wavelength of the quantum emitter and its intrinsic quantum yield play an important role and the impact of both has to be considered together when investigating their effect on the non-radiative decay rate. The energy transfer process from the emitter to the nanosphere has a complicated distance dependence, with a 1/r^6 regime, characteristic of the F\""orster energy transfer mechanism, but also exhibiting other distance dependence regimes. In the case of a donor-acceptor pair in the presence of a Au nanosphere, the donor couples strongly to the nanosphere, acting as an enhanced dipole; the donor-acceptor energy transfer rate then follows a F\""orster trend, with an increased F\""orster radius. The angular dependence of the energy transfer efficiency between donor and acceptor has a strong dipole-dipole trend for small spheres and deviates from it for larger spheres, especially when the donor and acceptor are on opposite sides of the sphere. The spectral overlap of the donor emission, acceptor absorption and gold nanosphere extinction shows an interesting trend in that the largest F\""orster radius is obtained when the donor emission and acceptor absorption maxima are somewhat red-shifted from the localized surface plasmon peak in the extinction spectrum of the Au nanosphere, being located between it and the near-field scattering maximum.

Atie,  Zhihua Xie,  Ali El Eter,  Roland Salut,  Dusan Nedeljkovic,  Tony Tannous,  Fadi I. Baida,  Thierry Grosjean;  Plasmonic nano-antennas have proven the outstanding ability of sensing chemical and physical processes down to the nano-meter scale. Sensing is usually achieved within the highly confined optical fields generated resonantly by the nano-antennas, i.e. in contact to the nano-structures. In these paper, We demonstrate the sensing capability of nano-antennas to their larger scale environment, well beyond their plasmonic confinement volume, leading to the concept of 'remote' (non contact) sensing on the nano-meter scale. On the basis of a bowtie-aperture nano-antenna (BNA) integrated at the apex of a SNOM fiber tip, we introduce an ultra-compact, move-able and background-free optical nano-sensor for the remote sensing of a silicon surface (up to distance of 300 nm). Sensitivity of the BNA to its large scale environment is high enough to expect the monitoring and control of the spacing between the nano-antenna and a silicon surface with sub-nano-meter accuracy. This work paves the way towards a new class of nano-positionning technique, based on nano-antenna resonance monitoring, that are alternative to nano-mechanical and optical interference-based devices. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Chembo;  We report the observation of stimulated Brillouin scattering and lasing at 1550~nm in barium fluoride (BaF$_2$) crystal. Brillouin lasing was achieved with ultra-high quality ($Q$) factor monolithic whispering gallery mode (WGM) mm-size disk resonators. Overmoded resonators were specifically used to provide cavity resonances for both the pump and all Brillouin Stokes waves. Single and multiple Brillouin Stokes radiations with frequency shift ranging from $8.2$ GHz up to $49$ GHz have been generated through cascaded Brillouin lasing. BaF$_2$ resonator-based Brillouin lasing can find potential applications for high-coherence lasers and microwave photonics. ;Optics (physics.optics)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.02329;On the dispersion management of fluorite whispering-gallery mode  resonators for Kerr optical frequency comb generation in the telecom and  mid-infrared range; Guoping Lin,  Yanne K. Chembo;  Optical whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonators have been very attracting platforms for versatile Kerr frequency comb generations. We report a systematic study on the material dispersion of various optical materials that are capable of supporting quality factors above $10^9$. Using an analytical approximation of WGM resonant frequencies in disk resonators, we investigate the effect of the geometry and transverse mode order on the total group-velocity dispersion ($GVD$). We demonstrate that the major radii and the radial mode indices play an important role in tailoring the $GVD$ of WGM resonators. In particular, our study shows that in WGM disk-resonators, the polar families of modes have very similar $GVD$, while the radial families of modes feature dispersion values that can differ by up to several orders of magnitude. The effect of these giant dispersion shifts are experimentally evidenced in Kerr comb generation with magnesium fluoride. From a more general perspective, this critical feature enables to push the zero-dispersion wavelength of fluorite crystals towards the mid-infrared (mid-IR) range, thereby allowing for efficient Kerr comb generation in that spectral range. We show that barium fluoride is the most interesting crystal in this regard, due to its zero dispersion wavelength ($ZDW$) at $1.93 \rm{\mu m}$ and an optimal dispersion profile in the mid-IR regime. We expect our results to facilitate the design of different platforms for Kerr frequency comb generations in both telecommunication and mid-IR spectral ranges. ;Optics (physics.optics)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.02406;Subwavelength edge detection through trapped resonances in waveguides; Miguel Molerón,  Chiara Daraio;  Lenses that can collect the perfect image of an object must restore propagative and evanescent waves. However, for efficient information transfer, e.g., in compressed sensing, it is often desirable to detect only the fast spatial variations of the wave field (carried by evanescent waves), as the one created by edges or small details. Image processing edge detection algorithms perform such operation but they add time and complexity to the imaging process. Here, we present a new subwavelength approach that generates an image of only those components of the acoustic field that are equal to or smaller than the operating wavelength. The proposed technique converts evanescent waves into propagative waves exciting trapped resonances in a waveguide, and it uses periodicity to attenuate the propagative components. This approach achieves resolutions about an order of magnitude smaller than the operating wavelength and makes it possible to visualize independently edges aligned along different directions. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Olbinado,  Atsushi Momose,  Kun Gao,  Zhili Wang,  Huajie Han,  Meng Yang,  Kai Zhang,  Peiping Zhu,  Ziyu Wu;  X-ray Talbot-Lau interferometer has been used widely to conduct phase contrast imaging with a conventional low-brilliance x-ray source. Typically, in this technique, background correction has to be performed in order to obtain the pure signal of the sample under inspection. In this study, we reported on a research on the background correction strategies within this technique, especially we introduced a new phase unwrapping solution for one conventional background correction method, the key point of this new solution is changing the initial phase of each pixel by a cyclic shift operation on the raw images collected in phase stepping scan. Experimental result and numerical analysis showed that the new phase unwrapping algorithm could successfully subtract contribution of the system's background without error. Moreover, a potential advantage of this phase unwrapping strategy is that its effective phase measuring range could be tuned flexibly in some degree for example to be (-pi+3, pi+3], thus it would find usage in certain case because measuring range of the currently widely used background correction method is fixed to be (-pi, pi]. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Yuasa;  A method for the substantial reduction of propagation loss of surface plasmons was proposed and experimentally demonstrated. The method is based on the fact that the propagation loss of the surface plasmons depends significantly on the optical confinement of the plasmon. A plasmonic structure, which contains a metal and two dielectric layers of different refractive indexes, is proposed in order to optimize optical confinement and to reduce propagation loss of the surface plasmons. A low propagation loss of 0.17 dB/um for a surface plasmon in a Fe/MgO/AlGaAs plasmonic structure was achieved. A good coupling efficiency of 2.2 dB/facet between a surface plasmon in Fe/MgO/AlGaAs and a waveguide mode in AlGaAs/GaAs optical waveguide was demonstrated. ;Optics (physics.optics)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.02591;Bloch-like waves in random-walk potentials based on supersymmetry; Sunkyu Yu,  Xianji Piao,  Jiho Hong,  Namkyoo Park;  Bloch's theorem was a major milestone that established the principle of bandgaps in crystals. Although it was once believed that bandgaps could form only under conditions of periodicity and long-range correlations for Bloch's theorem, this restriction was disproven by the discoveries of amorphous media and quasicrystals. While network and liquid models have been suggested for the interpretation of Bloch-like waves in disordered media, these approaches based on searching for random networks with bandgaps have failed in the deterministic creation of bandgaps. Here, we reveal a deterministic pathway to bandgaps in random-walk potentials by applying the notion of supersymmetry to the wave equation. Inspired by isospectrality, we follow a methodology in contrast to previous methods: we transform order into disorder while preserving bandgaps. Our approach enables the formation of bandgaps in extremely-disordered potentials analogous to Brownian motion, and also allows the tuning of correlations while maintaining identical bandgaps, thereby creating a family of potentials with 'Bloch-like eigenstates'. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Disordered Systems and Neural Networks (cond-mat.dis-nn); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)"

In this study we demonstrate that such new characteristics are applicable to controlling not only surface waves but also free-space waves normal to metasurfaces. Both simulation and measurement results show selective absorption or transmission for specific pulses at the same frequency. Thus the waveform selectivity is expected to create a wider range of new applications, for instance, waveform-selective antennas and wireless communications. ;Optics (physics.optics)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.02685;Field of view advantage of conjugate adaptive optics in microscopy  applications; Jerome Mertz,  Hari Paudel,  Thomas G. Bifano;  The imaging performance of an optical microscope can be degraded by sample-induced aberrations. A general strategy to undo the effect of these aberrations is to apply wavefront correction with a deformable mirror (DM). In most cases, the DM is placed conjugate to the microscope pupil, called pupil adaptive optics (AO). When the aberrations are spatially variant, an alternative configuration involves placing the DM conjugate to the main source of aberrations, called conjugate AO. We provide theoretical and experimental comparison of both configurations for the simplified case where spatially variant aberrations are produced by a well defined phase screen. We pay particular attention to the resulting correction field of view (FOV). Conjugate AO is found to provide a significant FOV advantage. While this result is well known in the astronomy community, our goal here is to recast it specifically for the optical microscopy community. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Optical, Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) and Raman microscopies were used to quantify the damage. The intensity of A1g and E2g1 vibrational modes was recorded as a function of the number of irradiation pulses. The observed behavior was attributed to laser-induced bond breaking and subsequent atoms removal due to electronic excitations. The single-pulse optical damage threshold was determined for the monolayer and bulk under 800nm and 1030nm pulsed laser irradiation and the role of two-photon versus one photon absorption effects is discussed. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)"

Due to the coupling of the two constituent lattices, their degenerate optical modes form doublets, while the extra mode associated with unbroken supersymmetry forms a singlet state. Singlet lasing can be achieved for a wide range of design parameters either by introducing stronger loss in the partner lattice or by pumping only the main array. Our findings suggest the possibility of building single-mode, high-power laser arrays and are also important for understanding light transport dynamics in multimode Parity-Time symmetric photonic structures. ;Optics (physics.optics)

High resolution is achieved on one side of the device by tapering down the channel width while simultaneously maintaining propagation losses of a few dB. On the other, low-resolution side, output couplers are designed to optimize coupling to free space and to minimize channel cross talk via surface plasmons. Point sources separated by {\lambda}/15 can still be clearly distinguished. Moreover, up two 90% of the power of a point dipole is coupled to the device. Applications are high-resolution linear detector arrays and, by operating the device in reverse, high-resolution optical writing. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Direct band gap III-V semiconductors allow efficient light generation but the large mismatch in lattice constant, thermal expansion and crystal polarity makes their epitaxial growth directly on silicon extremely complex. Here, using a selective area growth technique in confined regions, we surpass this fundamental limit and demonstrate an optically pumped InP-based distributed feedback (DFB) laser array grown on (001)-Silicon operating at room temperature and suitable for wavelength-division-multiplexing applications. The novel epitaxial technology suppresses threading dislocations and anti-phase boundaries to a less than 20nm thick layer not affecting the device performance. Using an in-plane laser cavity defined by standard top-down lithographic patterning together with a high yield and high uniformity provides scalability and a straightforward path towards cost-effective co-integration with photonic circuits and III-V FINFET logic. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Recently, this has driven the development of a number of parallel and high speed imaging techniques such as light-sculpting microscopy, which has been used to capture neuronal dynamics at the whole brain and single cell level in small model organism. However, the broader applicability of light-sculpting microscopy is limited by the size of volumes for which high speed imaging can be obtained and scattering in brain tissue. Here, we present strategies for optimizing the present tradeoffs in light-sculpting microscopy. Various scanning modalities in light-sculpting microscopy are theoretically and experimentally evaluated, and strategies to maximize the obtainable volume speeds, and depth penetration in brain tissue using different laser systems are provided. Design-choices, important parameters and their trade-offs are experimentally demonstrated by performing calcium-imaging in acute mouse-brain slices. We further show that synchronization of line-scanning techniques with rolling-shutter read-out of the camera can reduce scattering effects and enhance image contrast at depth. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Once the single CS state is reached, it is possible to continue a path to compress it, broadening the corresponding single free spectral range (FSR) Kerr frequency comb. The first step to achieve this goal is to identify the stable regions in the parameter space via numerical simulations of the Lugiato-Lefever equation (LLE). Later, using this identification, we define a path from the stable modulation instability (SMI) region to the stable cavity solitons (SCS) region avoiding the chaotic and unstable regions. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Henderson,  Alexandre Francois,  Tess Reynolds,  Nicolas Riesen,  Tanya M. Monro;  The whispering gallery modes (WGMs) of optical resonators have prompted intensive research efforts due to their usefulness in the field of biological sensing, and their employment in nonlinear optics. While much information is available in the literature on numerical modeling of WGMs in microspheres, it remains a challenging task to be able to predict the emitted spectra of spherical microresonators. Here, we establish a customizable Finite- Difference Time-Domain (FDTD)-based approach to investigate the WGM spectrum of microspheres. The simulations are carried out in the vicinity of a dipole source rather than a typical plane-wave beam excitation, thus providing an effective analogue of the fluorescent dye or nanoparticle coatings used in experiment. The analysis of a single dipole source at different positions on the surface or inside a microsphere, serves to assess the relative efficiency of nearby radiating TE and TM modes, characterizing the profile of the spectrum. By varying the number, positions and alignments of the dipole sources, different excitation scenarios can be compared to analytic models, and to experimental results. The energy flux is collected via a nearby disk-shaped region. The resultant spectral profile shows a dependence on the configuration of the dipole sources. The power outcoupling can then be optimized for specific modes and wavelength regions. The development of such a computational tool can aid the preparation of optical sensors prior to fabrication, by preselecting desired the optical properties of the resonator. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)"

Finally, we describe a scheme we have introduced recently for high-resolution imaging of nanoplasmonic structures with ND-based tips that is capable of approaching the ultimate resolution anticipated by theory. ;Optics (physics.optics)

This provides the potential for high-resolution imaging through the MMF. While the input NA is increased, the number of propagation modes in the MMF and hence the output NA remains the same. This makes the image reconstruction process underdetermined and may limit the quality of the image reconstruction. In this paper, we aim to improve the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the image reconstruction in imaging through MMF. We notice that turbid media placed in the input of the MMF transforms the incoming waves into a better format for information transmission and information extraction. We call this transformation as holistic random (HR) encoding of turbid media. By exploiting the HR encoding, we make a considerable improvement on the SNR of the image reconstruction. For efficient utilization of the HR encoding, we employ sparse representation (SR), a relatively new signal reconstruction framework when it is provided with a HR encoded signal. This study shows for the first time to our knowledge the benefit of utilizing the HR encoding of turbid media for recovery in the optically underdetermined systems where the output NA of it is smaller than the input NA for imaging through MMF. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)"

High efficiency transfer of a strongly focused subwavelength spot through optical waveguide over large distances takes place with a period of revival. Super-oscillatory hot-spots with the sizes which are beyond the conventional Abbe diffraction limit can be observed at large distances from the source.

However, active control over the coupling between closely packed waveguides is highly desirable and yet remains a critical barrier towards ultra small footprint devices. A general approach to achieve active control in waveguide systems is to exploit optical nonlinearities enabled by a strong control pulse. However these devices suffer from the nonlinear absorption induced by the intense control pulse as the signal and its control propagate in the same waveguide. Here we experimentally demonstrate a unique scheme based on adiabatic elimination (AE) concept that effectively manipulates the coupling between densely packed waveguides. We demonstrate active coupling control between two closely packed waveguides by tuning the mode index of an in-between decoupled waveguide. This is achieved via a dark mode and thus leaves the signal unaffected by the induced losses. Such a scheme is a promising candidate for ultra-dense integrated nano-photonics such as on-chip ultrafast modulators and tunable filters for optical communication and quantum computing. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Our flexible method of optical induction is applied with a nondiffracting random intensity distribution. We focus on the analysis of a statistical output spectrum for many probe events with variance of the incoming beam's transverse spatial frequency. For particular spatial frequencies we find considerable signatures of transverse coherent backscattering. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Here, we study the optical response of a cantilever-like, silica, microsphere pendulum, evanescently coupled to a fiber taper. In a whispering gallery mode resonator the cavity mode and motion of the pendulum result in both dispersive and dissipative optomechanical interactions. This unique mechanism leads to an experimentally observable, asymmetric response function of the transduction spectrum which can be explained using coupled-mode theory. The optomechanical transduction, and its relationship to the external coupling gap, are investigated and we show that the experimental behavior is in good agreement with the theoretical predictions. A deep understanding of this mechanism is necessary to explore trapping and cooling in dissipative optomechanical systems. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Jović Savić;  As light localization becomes increasingly pronounced in photonic systems with less order, we investigate optically induced two-dimensional Fibonacci structures which are supposed to be amongst the most ordered realizations of deterministic aperiodic patterns. For the generation of corresponding refractive index structures, we implement a recently developed incremental induction method using nondiffracting Bessel beams as waveguide formation entities. Even though Fibonacci structures present slightly reduced order, we show that transverse light transport is significantly hampered here in comparison with periodic lattices that account for discrete diffraction. Our experimental findings are supported by numerical simulations that additionally illustrate a development of transverse light localization for increasing propagation distance. ;Optics (physics.optics)

It is shown both by direct integration of Maxwell-Bloch equations and using a simple analytical model that at large densities narrow transparency windows appear in otherwise completely opaque spectra. The existence of such windows is attributed to overlapping resonances. This effect, first introduced for three-level systems in [R. Puthumpally-Joseph, M. Sukharev, O. Atabek and E. Charron, Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 163603 (2014)], is due to strongly enhanced dipole-dipole interactions at high emitters' densities. The presented theory extends this effect to the case of multilevel systems. The theory is applied to the D1 transitions of interacting Rb-85 atoms. It is shown that at high atomic densities, Rb-85 atoms can behave as three-level emitters exhibiting all the properties of dipole induced electromagnetic transparency. Applications including slow light and laser pulse shaping are also proposed. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

Bhadra;  The red shifted solitonic resonant radiation is a fascinating phase matching phenomenon that occurs when an optical pulse, launched in the normal dispersion regime of photonic crystal fiber, radiates across the zero dispersion wavelength. The formation of such phase-matched radiation is independent of the generation of any optical soliton and mainly governed by the leading edge of input pump which forms a shock front. The radiation is generated at the anomalous dispersion regime and found to be confined both in time and frequency domain. We experimentally investigate the formation of such radiations in photonic crystal fibers with detailed theoretical analysis. Our theoretical predictions corroborate well with experimental results. Further we extend our study for long length fiber and investigate the interplay between red-shifted solitonic resonant radiation and intrapulse Raman scattering (IPRS). It is observed that series of radiation-seeded Raman solitons are generated in anomalous dispersion regime. ;Optics (physics.optics)

This promises a plethora of novel applications like single photon transistors. Nevertheless, building the components of such devices is technologically extremely challenging. We tackle this task by lithographically fabricating on-chip plasmonic waveguides, efficiently connected to far-field in- and out-coupling ports via low-loss dielectric waveguides. Furthermore, a nano-assembling technology is developed, enabling the controlled coupling of single organic emitters to the plasmonic waveguides. Dibenzoterrylene fluorescent molecules hosted in anthracene crystals are investigated for this purpose. Here we present all key-components and technologies for a plasmon-excited single molecule non-linear device. ;Optics (physics.optics)

However, a change of the emission rate caused by environment different from free space has a classical counterpart. Not only quantum emitters, but any small antenna tuned to the resonance is an oscillator with radiative losses, and the influence of the environment on its radiation can be understood and measured in terms of the antenna radiation resistance. We present a general approach which is applicable to measurements of the Purcell factor for radio antennas and to calculations of these factors for quantum emitters. Our methodology is suitable for calculation and measurement of both electric and magnetic Purcell factors, it is versatile and applies to various frequency ranges. The approach is illustrated by a general equivalent scheme and allows the Purcell factor to be expressed through the continious radiation of a small antenna in presence of the environment. ;Optics (physics.optics)

We derive a framework for this scheme, defined Real Domain-FROG (ReD-FROG), as applied to the cases of interference between sum and difference frequency components and between fundamental and sum/difference frequency components. A successful numerical demonstration of ReD-FROG as applied to the case of a self-referenced measurement is provided.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.04871;Photoacoustic generation by a gold nanosphere: From linear to nonlinear  thermoelastics in the long-pulse illumination regime; Amaury Prost,  Florian Poisson,  Emmanuel Bossy;  We investigate theoretically the photoacoustic generation by a gold nanosphere in water in the thermoelastic regime. Specifically, we consider the long-pulse illumination regime, in which the time for electron-phonon thermalisation can be neglected and photoacoustic wave generation arises solely from the thermo-elastic stress caused by the temperature increase of the nanosphere or its liquid environment. Photoacoustic signals are predicted computed based on the successive resolution of a thermal diffusion problem and a thermoelastic problem, taking into account the finite size of the gold nanosphere and the temperature-dependence of the thermal expansion coefficient of water. For sufficiently high illumination fluences, this temperature dependence yields a nonlinear relationship between the photoacoustic amplitude and the fluence. For nanosecond pulses in the linear regime, we show that more than 90 % of the emitted photoacoustic energy is generated in water, and the thickness of the generating layer around the particle scales close to the square root of the pulse duration. Our results demonstrate that the point-absorber model introduced by Calasso et al.[17] significantly overestimates the amplitude of photoacoustic waves in the nonlinear regime. We therefore provide quantitative estimates of a critical energy, defined as the absorbed energy required such that the nonlinear contribution is equal to that of the linear contribution. Our results suggest that the critical energy scales as the volume of water over which heat diffuses during the illumination pulse. Moreover, thermal nonlinearity is shown to be expected only for sufficiently high ultrasound frequency. Finally, we show that the relationship between the photoacoustic amplitude and the equilibrium temperature at sufficiently high fluence reflects the thermal diffusion at the nanoscale around the gold nanosphere. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Spectrographs consist of collimating, angular dispersive, and focusing optical elements. Bragg reflecting crystals arranged in an asymmetric scattering geometry are used as the dispersing elements. A ray-transfer matrix technique is applied to propagate x-rays through the optical elements. Several optical designs of hard x-ray spectrographs are proposed and their performance is analyzed. Spectrographs with an energy resolution of 0.1 meV and a spectral window of imaging up to a few tens of meVs are shown to be feasible for inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS) spectroscopy applications.

Current benchmarking laser-based technologies rely on a medium to assist the light-matter interaction, which impose material limitations or strongly inhomogeneous fields. The advent of few cycle ultra-intense radially polarized lasers has materialized an extensively studied novel accelerator that adopts the simplest form of laser acceleration and is unique in requiring no medium to achieve strong longitudinal energy transfer directly from laser to particle. Here we present the first observation of direct longitudinal laser acceleration of non-relativistic electrons that undergo highly-directional multi-GeV/m accelerating gradients. This demonstration opens a new frontier for direct laser-driven particle acceleration capable of creating well collimated and relativistic attosecond electron bunches and x-ray pulses. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Accelerator Physics (physics.acc-ph)"

We demonstrate that this analogy may be used to build a metamaterial model of a time crystal, which has been recently suggested by Wilczek and Shapere.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.05289;Writing and erasing of temporal cavity solitons by direct phase  modulation of the cavity driving field; Jae K. Jang,  Miro Erkintalo,  Stuart G. Murdoch,  Stephane Coen;  Temporal cavity solitons (CSs) are persisting pulses of light that can manifest themselves in continuously driven passive resonators, such as macroscopic fiber ring cavities and monolithic microresonators. Experiments so far have demonstrated two techniques for their excitation, yet both possess drawbacks in the form of system complexity or lack of control over soliton positioning. Here we experimentally demonstrate a new CS writing scheme that alleviates these deficiencies. Specifically, we show that temporal CSs can be excited at arbitrary positions through direct phase modulation of the cavity driving field, and that this technique also allows existing CSs to be selectively erased. Our results constitute the first experimental demonstration of temporal cavity soliton excitation via direct phase modulation, as well as their selective erasure (by any means). These advances reduce the complexity of CS excitation and could lead to controlled pulse generation in monolithic microresonators. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS)"

Results show that the relative stabilities are 5E-14@1s and 2E-17@10000s. Meanwhile, compared with each site, time synchronization precision is less than 80 ps.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.05569;Dispersion in time and space: what propagating optical pulses in time (&  not space) forces us to confront; Paul Kinsler;"  I derive a temporally propagated uni-directional optical pulse equation valid in the few cycle limit. Temporal propagation is advantageous because it naturally preserves causality, unlike the competing spatially propagated models. The approach generates exact coupled bi-directional equations, which can be efficiently approximated down to a uni-directional form in cases where an optical pulse changes little over one optical cycle. It also also allows a direct term-to-term comparison of an exact bi-directional theory with an approximate uni-directional theory. Notably, temporal propagation handles dispersion in a different way, and this difference serves to highlight existing approximations inherent in spatially propagated treatments of dispersion. Accordingly, I emphasise the need for future work in clarifying the limitations of the dispersion conversion required by these types of approaches; since the only alternative in the few cycle limit may be to resort to the much more computationally intensive full Maxwell equation solvers. NOTE: despite the implication of the claimed ""substantial text overlap"" flagged up by arXiv, the physical meaning of this work differs from that of arXiv:0810.5689 -- it merely uses the same technique for decomposing waves into directional pieces,and as a consequence can have similar phrasing even when the physics is distinct.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.05570;Nonlocal homogenization theory in metamaterials: effective  electromagnetic spatial dispersion and artificial chirality; Alessandro Ciattoni,  Carlo Rizza;  We develop, from first principles, a general and compact formalism for predicting the electromagnetic response of a metamaterial with non-magnetic inclusions in the long wavelength limit, including spatial dispersion up to the second order. Specifically, by resorting to a suitable multiscale technique, we show that medium effective permittivity tensor and the first and second order tensors describing spatial dispersion can be evaluated by averaging suitable spatially rapidly-varying fields each satysifing electrostatic-like equations within the metamaterial unit cell. For metamaterials with negligible second-order spatial dispersion, we exploit the equivalence of first-order spatial dispersion and reciprocal bianisotropic electromagnetic response to deduce a simple expression for the metamaterial chirality tensor. Such an expression allows us to systematically analyze the effect of the composite spatial symmetry properties on electromagnetic chirality. We find that even if a metamaterial is geometrically achiral, i.e. it is indistinguishable from its mirror image, it shows pseudo-chiral-omega electromagnetic chirality if the rotation needed to restore the dielectric profile after the reflection is either a $0^\circ$ or $90^\circ$ rotation around an axis orthogonal to the reflection plane. These two symmetric situations encompass two-dimensional and one-dimensional metamaterials with chiral response. As an example admitting full analytical description, we discuss one-dimensional metamaterials whose single chirality parameter is shown to be directly related to the metamaterial dielectric profile by quadratures. ;Optics (physics.optics)

These interaction forces are usually strongly anisotropic depending on the interference landscape of the external fields. This is in contrast with the familiar isotropic, translationally invariant, van der Waals and, in general, Casimir-Lifshitz interactions between neutral bodies arising from random electromagnetic waves generated by equilibrium quantum and thermal fluctuations. Here we show, both theoretically and experimentally, that dispersion forces between small colloidal particles can also be induced and controlled using artificially created fluctuating light fields. Using optical tweezers as gauge, we present experimental evidence for the predicted isotropic attractive interactions between dielectric microspheres induced by laser-generated, random light fields. These light induced interactions open a path towards the control of translationally invariant interactions with tuneable strength and range in colloidal systems.

It is concluded that whether the second-order temporal interference pattern can be retrieved via two-photon coincidence counting measurement is dependent on the relationship between the resolution time of the detection system and the frequency difference between these two lasers. Two identical and tunable single-mode diode lasers are employed to verify the predictions experimentally. The experimental results are consistent with the theoretical predictions. These studies are helpful to understand the physics of two-photon interference with photons of different spectrums and application of two-photon interference in quantum information processing. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

As a simple Fabry-Perot model is not accurate enough to describe the structure's behavior, we propose to consider the slits as generalized cavities with two modes, one being propagative and the other evanescent. This very general model allows to conclude that the impact of spatial dispersion on the propagative mode is the key factor explaining why the whole structure is sensitive to spatial dispersion. As the fabrication of such structures with relatively large gaps compared to previous experiments is within our reach, this work paves the way for future much needed experiments on nonlocality. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)"

We proposed a method for real-time monitoring of the absolute frequency of CW-THz waves involving temporally parallel, i.e., simultaneous, measurement of two pairs of beat frequencies and laser repetition frequencies based on dual THz combs of photocarriers (PC-THz combs) with different frequency spacings. To demonstrate the method, THz-comb-referenced spectrum analyzers were constructed with a dual configuration based on dual femtosecond lasers. Regardless of the presence or absence of frequency control in the PC-THz combs, a frequency precision of 10-11 was achieved at a measurement rate of 100 Hz. Furthermore, large fluctuation of the CW-THz frequencies, crossing several modes of the PC-THz combs, was correctly monitored in real time.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06550;Polarization-resolved sensing with tilted fiber Bragg gratings: theory  and limits of detection; Aliaksandr Bialiayeu,  Anatoli Ianoul,  Jacques Albert;"  Polarization based sensing with tilted fiber Bragg grating (TFBG) sensors is analysed theoretically by two alternative approaches. The first method is based on tracking the grating transmission for two orthogonal states of linear polarized light that are extracted from the measured Jones matrix or Stokes vectors of the TFBG transmission spectra. The second method is based on the measurements along the system principle axes and polarization dependent loss (PDL) parameter, also calculated from measured data. It is shown that the frequent crossing of the Jones matrix eigenvalues as a function of wavelength leads to a non-physical interchange of the calculated principal axes; a method to remove this unwanted mathematical artefact and to restore the order of the system eigenvalues and the corresponding principal axes is provided. A comparison of the two approaches reveals that the PDL method provides a smaller standard deviation and therefore lower limit of detection in refractometric sensing. Furthermore, the polarization analysis of the measured spectra allows for the identification of the principal states of polarization of the sensor system and consequentially for the calculation of the transmission spectrum for any incident polarization state. The stability of the orientation of the system principal axes is also investigated as a function of wavelength. ";Optics (physics.optics)

Wright,  Iacopo Carusotto,  Matteo Clerici,  Daniele Faccio;  Quantum gases of atoms and exciton-polaritons are nowadays a well established theoretical and experimental tool for fundamental studies of quantum many-body physics and suggest promising applications to quantum computing. Given their technological complexity, it is of paramount interest to devise other systems where such quantum many-body physics can be investigated at a lesser technological expense. Here we examine a relatively well-known system of laser light propagating through thermo-optical defocusing media: based on a hydrodynamical description of light as a quantum fluid of interacting photons, we investigate such systems as a valid, room temperature alternative to atomic or exciton-polariton condensates for studies of many-body physics. First, we show that by using a technique traditionally used in oceanography, it is possible to perform a direct measurement of the single-particle part of the dispersion relation of the elementary excitations on top of the photon fluid and to detect its global flow. Then, using a pump-and-probe set-up, we investigate the collective nature of low-wavevector sound modes of the fluid and observe signatures of superfluid behaviour. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06931;Single-side access, isotropic resolution and multispectral 3D  photoacoustic imaging with rotate-translate scanning of ultrasonic detector  array; Jérôme Gateau,  Marc Gesnik,  Jean-Marie Chassot,  Emmanuel Bossy;  Photoacoustic imaging can achieve high-resolution three-dimensional visualization of optical absorbers at penetration depths ~ 1 cm in biological tissues by detecting optically-induced high ultrasound frequencies. Tomographic acquisition with ultrasound linear arrays offers an easy implementation of single-side access, parallelized and high-frequency detection, but usually comes with an image quality impaired by the directionality of the detectors. Indeed, a simple translation of the array perpendicularly to its median imaging plane is often used, but results both in a poor resolution in the translation direction and in strong limited view artifacts. To improve the spatial resolution and the visibility of complex structures while keeping a planar detection geometry, we introduce, in this paper, a novel rotate-translate scanning scheme, and investigate the performance of a scanner implemented at 15 MHz center frequency. The developed system achieved a quasi-isotropic uniform 3D resolution of ~170 um over a cubic volume of side length 8.5 mm, i.e. an improvement in the resolution in the translation direction by almost one order of magnitude. Dual wavelength imaging was also demonstrated with ultrafast wavelength shifting. The validity of our approach was shown in vitro. We discuss the ability to enable in vivo imaging for preclinical and clinical studies. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Medical Physics (physics.med-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.0204;Theoretical formalism for collective electromagnetic response of  discrete metamaterial systems; Stewart D. Jenkins,  Janne Ruostekoski;  We develop a general formalism to describe the propagation of a near-resonant electromagnetic field in a medium composed of magnetodielectric resonators. As the size and the spatial separation of nanofabricated resonators in a metamaterial array is frequently less than the wavelength, we describe them as discrete scatterers, supporting a single mode of current oscillation represented by a single dynamic variable. We derive a Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalism for the coupled electromagnetic fields and oscillating currents in the length gauge, obtained by the Power-Zienau-Woolley transformation. The response of each resonator to electromagnetic field is then described by polarization and magnetization densities that, to the lowest order in a multipole expansion, generate electric and magnetic dipole excitations. We derive a closed set of equations for the coherently scattered field and normal mode amplitudes of current oscillations of each resonator both within the rotating wave approximation, in which case the radiative decay rate is much smaller than the resonance frequency, and without such an assumption. The set of equations includes the radiative couplings between a discrete set of resonators mediated by the electromagnetic field, fully incorporating recurrent scattering processes to all orders. By considering an example of a two-dimensional split ring resonator metamaterial array, we show that the system responds cooperatively to near-resonant field, exhibiting collective eigenmodes, resonance frequencies, and radiative linewidths that result from strong radiative interactions between closely-spaced resonators. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

Two symmetric nanobeams are created by placing three air slots in a silicon photonic crystal slab where three holes are removed. The optical quality factor (Q) is optimized up to 52,000. The nanobeams' mechanical frequencies are higher than 600 MHz due to their femtogram effective modal masses. The optical and mechanical modes are dispersively coupled with a vacuum optomechanical coupling rate g0/2pi exceeding 200 kHz. The anchor-loss-limited mechanical Q of the differential beam mode is evaluated to be greater than 10,000 for structures with ideally symmetric beams. The influence of variations on the air slot width and position is also investigated. The devices can be used as ultrasensitive sensors of mass, force, and displacement. ;Optics (physics.optics)

In this work we present an approach to calculate the multipole excitations in arbitrary arrays of nanoscatterers in a dielectric host medium. We introduce a simple and illustrative multipole decomposition of the electric currents excited in the scatterers and link this decomposition to the classical multipole expansion of the scattered field. In particular, we find that completely different multipoles can produce identical scattered fields. The presented multipole theory can be used as a basis for the design and characterization of optical nanomaterials. ;Optics (physics.optics)

The photonic AMS possesses a helical phase, the orbital-angular-momentum degree of freedom in photons. Unlike the traditional slow-light schemes in metamaterials by using orthogonal polarizations, the photonic AMSs are dipole forbidden for all polarizations of free-space radiation due to the existence of helical phase. Numerical simulation for a metamaterial design proves the feasibility of this scheme, in which the indirectly excitation of dark photonic AMSs burns some transmission dips in the otherwise high transmission window. With the unique merits of dark photonic AMSs, this slow light scheme can realize a high group index $n_g$ greater than $\sim500$. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.0666;Cross-correlation Imaging for Waveguide Characterization; R. A. Barankov;  Confined geometries, such as optical waveguides, support a discrete set of eigen-modes. In multimoded structures, depending on the boundary conditions, superposition states can propagate. Characterization of these states is a fundamental problem important in waveguide design and testing, especially for optical applications. In this work, I have developed a novel interferometric method that provides complete characterization of optical waveguide modes and their superposition states. The basic idea of the method is to study the interference of the beam radiated from an optical waveguide with an external reference beam, and detect different waveguide modes in the time-domain by changing the relative optical paths of the two beams. In particular, this method, called cross-correlation or C$^2$-imaging, provides the relative amplitudes of the modes and their group delays. For every mode, one can determine the dispersion, intensity and phase distributions, and also local polarization properties. As a part of this work, I have developed the mathematical formalism of C$^2$-imaging and built an experimental setup implementing the idea. I have carried out an extensive program of experiments, confirming the ability of the method to completely characterize waveguide properties. ;Optics (physics.optics)

For an engineered silicon optomechanical crystal nanocavity supporting a 4 GHz localized phonon mode, optical signals in a 1.5 MHz bandwidth are coherently converted over a 11.2 THz frequency span between one cavity mode at wavelength 1460 nm and a second cavity mode at 1545 nm with a 93% internal (2% external) peak efficiency. The thermal and quantum limiting noise involved in the conversion process is also analyzed, and in terms of an equivalent photon number signal level are found to correspond to an internal noise level of only 6 and 4x10-3 quanta, respectively. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.0815;All-Optical Quantum Random Bit Generation from Intrinsically Binary  Phase of Parametric Oscillators; Alireza Marandi,  Nick C. Leindecker,  Konstantin L. Vodopyanov,  Robert L. Byer;  True random number generators (RNGs) are desirable for applications ranging from cryptogra- phy to computer simulations. Quantum phenomena prove to be attractive for physical RNGs due to their fundamental randomness and immunity to attack [1]- [5]. Optical parametric down conversion is an essential element in most quantum optical experiments including optical squeezing [9], and generation of entangled photons [10]. In an optical parametric oscillator (OPO), photons generated through spontaneous down conversion of the pump initiate the oscillation in the absence of other inputs [11, 12]. This quantum process is the dominant effect during the oscillation build-up, leading to selection of one of the two possible phase states above threshold in a degenerate OPO [13]. Building on this, we demonstrate a novel all-optical quantum RNG in which the photodetection is not a part of the random process, and no post processing is required for the generated bit sequence. We implement a synchronously pumped twin degenerate OPO, which comprises two identical independent OPOs in a single cavity, and measure the relative phase states of the OPO outputs above threshold as a bit value. We show that the outcome is statistically random with 99% confidence. With the use of micro- and nanoscale OPO resonators, this technique offers a promise for simple, robust, and high-speed on-chip all-optical quantum random number generators. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

Schell,  Tim Schröder,  Oliver Benson;  Spectral diffusion is the phenomenon of random jumps in the emission wavelength of narrow lines. This phenomenon is a major hurdle for applications of solid state quantum emitters like quantum dots, molecules or diamond defect centers in an integrated quantum optical technology. Here, we provide further insight into the underlying processes of spectral diffusion of the zero phonon line of single nitrogen vacancy centers in nanodiamonds by using a novel method based on photon correlation interferometry. The method works although the spectral diffusion rate is several orders of magnitude higher than the photon detection rate and thereby improves the time resolution of previous experiments with nanodiamonds by six orders of magnitude. We study the dependency of the spectral diffusion rate on the excitation power, temperature, and excitation wavelength under off-resonant excitation. Our results suggest a strategy to increase the number of spectrally indistinguishable photons emitted by diamond nanocrystals. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

Juan,  Gabriel Molina-Terriza;  Modern physics is largely devoted to study conservation laws, such as charge, energy, linear momentum or angular momentum, because they give us information about the symmetries of our universe. Here, we propose to add the relationship between electromagnetic duality and helicity to the toolkit. Generalized electromagnetic duality symmetry, broken in the microscopic Maxwell's equations by the empirical absence of magnetic charges, can be restored for the macroscopic Maxwell's equations. The restoration of this symmetry is shown to be independent of the geometry of the problem. These results provide a simple and powerful tool for the study of light-matter interactions within the framework of symmetries and conservation laws. We apply such framework to the experimental investigation of helicity transformations in cylindrical nanoapertures, and we find that the transformation is significantly enhanced by the coupling to surface modes, where electromagnetic duality is strongly broken. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Phasing with high resolution RPI and the oversampling ratio $\sigma=4$ determines a unique phasing solution up to a global phase factor. Under this condition, the standard phasing algorithms converge rapidly to the true solution without stagnation. Excellent approximation is achieved after a small number of iterations, not just with high resolution but also low resolution RPI in the presence of additive as well multiplicative noises. It is shown that RPI with $\sigma=2$ is sufficient for phasing complex-valued images under a sector condition and $\sigma=1$ for phasing nonnegative images. The Error Reduction algorithm with RPI is proved to converge to the true solution under proper conditions. ;Optics (physics.optics)

The applied annealing procedure reduces the absorption coefficient at the peak position of the scintillation spectrum ($\sim430$ nm) by a factor of $\sim6$ and leads to an even larger reduction of the scattering coefficient. Furthermore, the annealing has no significant influence on the \emph{intrinsic} light yield. An additional absorption occurring at $\sim400$ nm suggests the formation of O$^-$ hole centers. Light-yield measurements at room temperature where one crystal surface was mechanically roughened showed an increase of the \emph{measured} light yield by $\sim40 %$ and an improvement of the energy resolution at 59.5 keV by $\sim12 %$ for the annealed crystal. We ascribe this result to the reduction of the absorption coefficient while the surface roughening is needed to compensate for the also observed reduction of the scattering coefficient after annealing. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM)"

It is shown that the fundamental quantization conditions that break down in the laboratory system of coordinates restore in the intrinsic system, which make it realizable to canonically quantize the radiation field.

The source is a random partially polarized beam of light obeying Gaussian statistics and the image quality is evaluated as a function of the degree of polarization (DoP). We show that the visibility improves when the DoP and the order of imaging increase, while the SNR behaves oppositely. The CNR is for the most part independent of DoP and the imaging order.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.1921;"Light-intensity susceptibility and ""active"" noise spectroscopy"; Gleb G. Kozlov,  Valerii S. Zapasskii;"  In this paper, we consider informative potentialities of the ""active"" optical noise spectroscopy, under which we understand, generally, spectroscopy of response of a multilevel quantum system to the resonant optical field with its intensity modulated by ""white"" noise. We show that calculations of such a response can be most conveniently performed, in the linear approximation, by introducing the notion of light-intensity susceptibility (LIS) whose spectrum is determined by Laplace transform of the response to a small step-wise change of the optical field intensity. The results of calculations for a simple four-level quantum system show that its LIS spectrum may provide information not only about the ground-state structure (like conventional Faraday-rotation-based spin noise spectroscopy), but also about properties of the optical transitions (including nutation frequencies in the applied optical field). From the experimental point of view, such a noise spectroscopy of the intensity-related susceptibility can be especially efficient in combination with the up-to-date spectrum analyzers providing extremely fast data processing.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.2285;Giant Transverse Optical Forces in Nanoscale Slot Waveguides of  Hyperbolic Metamaterials; Yingran He,  Sailing He,  Jie Gao,  Xiaodong Yang;  Here we demonstrate that giant transverse optical forces can be generated in nanoscale slot waveguides of hyperbolic metamaterials, with more than two orders of magnitude stronger compared to the force created in conventional silicon slot waveguides, due to the nanoscale optical field enhancement and the extreme optical energy compression within the air slot region. Both numerical simulation and analytical treatment are carried out to study the dependence of the optical forces on the waveguide geometries and the metamaterial permittivity tensors, including the attractive optical forces for the symmetric modes and the repulsive optical forces for the anti-symmetric modes. The significantly enhanced transverse optical forces result from the strong optical mode coupling strength between two metamaterial waveguides, which can be explained with an explicit relation derived from the coupled mode theory. Moreover, the calculation on realistic metal-dielectric multilayer structures indicates that the predicted giant optical forces are achievable in experiments, which will open the door for various optomechanical applications in nanoscale, such as optical nanoelectromechanical systems, optical sensors and actuators. ;Optics (physics.optics)

The ablated features have diameters of 20-100 microns and average root-mean-square (RMS) surface microroughness near their center of less than 0.2 nm. Temporally monitoring the fabrication process revealed that it proceeds on a time scale shorter than the laser pulse duration. We implement a fast feedback control loop (20 kHz bandwidth) based on the light emitted by the sample that ensures an RMS size dispersion of less than 5 percent in arrays on chips or in individually fabricated features on an optical fiber tip, a significant improvement over previous approaches using longer pulses and open loop operation. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.2978;Hollow core Bragg fiber with antiresonant intermediate layer; Yurii A. Zinin,  Andrey V. Panov,  Yurii N. Kulchin;  By means of the transfer matrix method, the optical properties of fibers with a distinct intermediate layer between a hol-low core and periodic cladding are calculated. The periodic cladding consists of two types of the alternating layers. The intermediate layer has distinct thickness and refractive index. Depending on these parameters, the fiber can work in the single-mode or multi-mode regimes. In the multi-mode regime, the optical loss of the smallest loss mode can be de-creased by increasing the thickness of the layer. In the single-mode regime, the optical loss falls with a rise in the refrac-tive index of the intermediate layer. The optical properties of the fiber are determined by the antiresonance reflection from the intermediate layer and the Bragg reflection from the periodic cladding. Selecting the parameters of the interme-diate layer, the optical loss of the fiber in the single-mode regime can be reduced by an order of magnitude over the loss of the traditional Bragg fiber. ;Optics (physics.optics)

The proposed spectrometer consists only of the fiber and a camera that images the speckle pattern generated by interference among the fiber modes. While this speckle pattern is detrimental to many applications, it encodes information about the spectral content of the input signal which can be recovered using calibration data. We achieve a spectral resolution of 0.15 nm over 25 nm bandwidth using 1 meter long fiber, and 0.03 nm resolution over 5 nm bandwidth with a 5 meter fiber. The insertion loss is less than 10%, and the signal to noise ratio in the reconstructed spectra is over 1000. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Although the light scattering is a random process, different paths through the medium can be correlated encoding information about the medium. Here, we present spectroscopic measurements of nonuniversal intensity correlations that emerge when embedding quantum emitters inside a disordered photonic crystal that is found to Anderson-localize light. The emitters probe in-situ the microscopic details of the medium, and imprint such near-field properties onto the far-field correlations. Our findings provide new ways of enhancing light-matter interaction for quantum electrodynamics and energy harvesting, and may find applications in subwavelength diffuse-wave spectroscopy for biophotonics. ;Optics (physics.optics)

In comparison with typical free-space cavities, the fiber-cavity's small mode size (10 {\mu}m waist, 80 {\mu}m length) allows the use of smaller, lighter membranes and increases the cavity-membrane linear coupling to 3 GHz/nm and quadratic coupling to 20 GHz/nm^2. This device is also intrinsically fiber-coupled and uses glass ferrules for passive alignment. These improvements will greatly simplify the use of optomechanical systems, particularly in cryogenic settings. At room temperature, we expect these devices to be able to detect the shot noise of radiation pressure. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

Unlike the set of plane wave solutions of electromagnetic fields, the multipolar solutions do not share a standard derivation or notation. As a result, expressions originating from different derivations can be difficult to compare. Some of the derivations of the multipolar solutions do not explicitly show their relation to the angular momentum operators, thus hiding important properties of these solutions. In this article, the relation between two of the most common derivations of this set of solutions is explicitly shown and their relation to the angular momentum operators is exposed. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Classical Physics (physics.class-ph)"

The method makes use of the coherent state of light and requires only a simple modification to the standard Michelson interferometer. The surface fluctuation spectra of liquids are measured using this method down to a few orders of magnitude below the shot noise level. The spectrum derived from hydrodynamical considerations agrees well with the observed results for water. However, for oil, slight deviations are seen at high frequencies ($\gtrsim1\,$MHz), perhaps indicating its more complex underlying physics. The measurement requires a relatively low light power and a short time, so that it has a wide range of applicability. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

The first experimental demonstrations of cloaking used artificial metamaterials to respond to this challenge. In this work we show how a much simpler technique of electromagnetically induced transparency can be used to achieve a partial, {\it carpet} cloaking at optical frequencies in atomic vapours or solids. To generate a desired combination of low absorption with strong modifications of the refractive index, we use chiral media with an induced magneto-electrical cross-coupling. We demonstrate that high-contrast positive refractive indices can be attained by fine tuning the material with a gradient magnetic field and calculate the parameters required to construct a carpet cloak. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

Raman scattering of test molecules (B. Megaterium), deposited on the waveguides' surface, exhibited azimuthal cycles upon rotation: at these micron scales, spontaneous Raman ought to be independent of phase matching conditions. In addition, we observed angular-selective quadratic intensity dependence contrary to the typical linear behavior of spontaneous Raman. The effects were observed at very modest pump laser intensities (<10 MW/cm2 at the sample surface, oftenly used in Raman experiments). We attributed these observations to nonlinear coupling between the vibrating molecules and surface plasmon polariton (SPP) modes at the molecular vibration frequency. It was assessed that the polariton mode propagates through fairly long distances (over 100 microns). ;"Optics (physics.optics); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall); Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)"

In the heterodyne configuration, the beating between the reference beam and the signal beam is realized outside the laser cavity while in the autodyne configuration, the wave beating takes place inside the laser cavity and the relaxation oscillations of the laser intensity then play an important part. For a given laser output power, object under investigation and detection noise level, we have determined the amplification gain of the LOFI interferometer compared to the heterodyne interferometer. LOFI interferometry is demonstrated to show higher performances than heterodyne interferometry for a wide range of laser power and detection level of noise.

While the method indeed yields two signs of the intrinsic impedance, and thus the wave number, the signs are dependent, and moreover, both sign combinations lead to the same permittivity and permeability, and are thus permissible. This observation is in distinct contrast to a number of statements in the literature where the correct sign of the intrinsic impedance and wave number, resulting from the scattering parameter method, is chosen by imposing additional physical requirements such as passivity. The scattering parameter method is reviewed through an investigation of a uniform plane wave normally incident on a planar slab in free-space, and the severity of the branch ambiguity is illustrated through simulations of a known metamaterial realization. Several approaches for proper branch selection are reviewed and their suitability to metamaterial samples is discussed. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)"

We developed a technique to measure these parameters in-situ by determining the frequency spacing between the resonances of fundamental and spatial modes of an optical cavity. Two laser beams are injected into the cavity, and their relative frequency is scanned by a phase-lock loop, while the cavity is locked to either laser. The measurement of the amplitude of their beat note in transmission reveals the resonances of the longitudinal and the transverse modes of the cavity and their spacing. This method proves particularly useful to characterize complex optical systems, including very long and/or coupled optical cavities, as in gravitational wave interferometers.

Shank,  Yurii A. Vlasov,  Joyce K. S. Poon;  Microring optical modulators are being explored extensively for energy-efficient photonic communication networks in future high-performance computing systems and microprocessors, because they can significantly reduce the power consumption of optical transmitters via the resonant circulation of light. However, resonant modulators have traditionally suffered from a trade-off between their power consumption and maximum operation bit rate, which were thought to depend oppositely upon the cavity linewidth. Here, we break this linewidth limitation using a silicon microring. By controlling the rate at which light enters and exits the microring, we demonstrate modulation free of the parasitic cavity linewidth limitations at up to 40 GHz, more than 6x the cavity linewidth. The device operated at 28 Gb/s using single-ended drive signals less than 1.5 V. The results show that high-Q resonant modulators can be designed to be simultaneously low-power and high-speed, features which are mutually incompatible in typical resonant modulators studied to date. ;Optics (physics.optics)

E 70, 036604 (2004)] have provided a theoretical underpinning for computer-aided investigations into dynamics of high-power ultrashort laser pulses and have been successfully utilized for almost a decade. Unfortunately, they are restricted to applications in bulk media or, with additional approximations, to simple waveguide geometries in which only a few guided modes can approximate the propagating waveform. The purpose of this work is to generalize the directional pulse propagation equations to structures characterized by strong refractive index differences and material interfaces. We also outline a numerical solution framework that draws on the combination of the bulk-media UPPE method with single-frequency beam-propagation techniques. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Russell,  Alexander Woolf,  Thomas C. Sadler,  Haitham A.R. El-Ella,  Menno J. Kappers,  Rachel A. Oliver,  Evelyn L. Hu;  Effective, permanent tuning of the whispering gallery modes (WGMs) of p-i-n doped GaN microdisk cavity with embedded InGaN quantum dots over one free spectral range is successfully demonstrated by irradiating the microdisks with a ultraviolet laser (380nm) in DI water. For incident laser powers between 150 and 960 nW, the tuning rate varies linearly. Etching of the top surface of the cavity is proposed as the driving force for the observed shift in WGMs, and is supported by experiments. The tuning for GaN/InGaN microdisk cavities is an important step for deterministically realizing novel nanophotonic devices for studying cavity quantum electrodynamics. ;Optics (physics.optics)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.5563;Helicity and Angular Momentum. A Symmetry based framework for the study  of Light-Matter Interactions; Ivan Fernandez-Corbaton,  Xavier Zambrana-Puyalto,  Gabriel Molina-Terriza;  We propose a new theoretical and practical framework for the study of light-matter interactions and the angular momentum of light. Our proposal is based on helicity, total angular momentum, and the use of symmetries. We compare the new framework to the current treatment, which is based on separately considering spin angular momentum and orbital angular momentum and using the transfer between the two in physical explanations. In our proposal, the fundamental problem of spin and orbital angular momentum separability is avoided, predictions are made based on the symmetries of the systems, and the practical application of the concepts is straightforward. Finally, the framework is used to show that the concept of spin to orbit transfer applied to focusing and scattering is masking two completely different physical phenomena related to the breaking of different fundamental symmetries: transverse translational symmetry in focusing and electromagnetic duality symmetry in scattering. ;Optics (physics.optics)

In addition to the electric resonances, the dielectric particles exhibit very strong magnetic resonances at the nanoscale, that can be employed in the Yagi-Uda geometry for creating highly efficient optical nanoantennas. By comparing plasmonic and dielectric nanoantennas, we demonstrate that all-dielectric nanoantennas may exhibit better radiation efficiency also allowing more compact design. ;Optics (physics.optics)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.5858;Theory of Polarization Attraction in Parametric Amplifiers Based on  Telecommunication Fibers; Massimiliano Guasoni,  Victor V. Kozlov,  Stefan Wabnitz;  We develop from first principles the coupled wave equations that describe polarization-sensitive parametric amplification based on four-wave mixing in standard (randomly birefringent) optical fibers. We show that in the small-signal case these equations can be solved analytically, and permit us to predict the gain experienced by the signal beam as well as its state of polarization (SOP) at the fiber output. We find that, independently of its initial value, the output SOP of a signal within the parametric gain bandwidth is solely determined by the pump SOP. We call this effect of pulling the polarization of the signal towards a reference SOP as polarization attraction, and such parametric amplifier as the FWM-polarizer. Our theory is valid beyond the zero polarization mode dispersion (PMD) limit, and it takes into account moderate deviations of the PMD from zero. In particular, our theory is capable of analytically predicting the rate of degradation of the efficiency of the parametric amplifier which is caused by the detrimental PMD effect. ;Optics (physics.optics)

The cavities are fabricated by focused ion beam milling, and provide mode volumes less than a cubic micrometre. The quantum dot emission spectrum, spatial modes, and lifetime are all modified substantially by the presence of the cavity, and can be tuned by actively varying the cavity length. An increase in emission rate of 75% is achieved at room temperature, attributed to the Purcell effect in the 'bad emitter' regime. We demonstrate a high degree of control over the emission from the dots, including near single-mode operation and the ability to detect strong emission from individual nanocrystals. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

Panigrahi,  Soumyajit Roy,  Ayan Banerjee;  We study the effects of the spin orbit interaction (SOI) of light in an optical trap and show that the propagation of the tightly focused trapping beam in a stratified medium can lead to significantly enhanced SOI. For a plane polarized incident beam the SOI manifests itself by giving rise to a strong anisotropic linear diattenuation effect which produces polarization-dependent off-axis high intensity side lobes near the focal plane of the trap. Single micron-sized asymmetric particles can be trapped in the side lobes, and transported over circular paths by a rotation of the plane of input polarization. We demonstrate such controlled motion on single pea-pod shaped single soft oxometalate (SOM) particles of dimension around $1\times 0.5\mu$m over lengths up to $\sim$15 $\mu$m . The observed effects are supported by calculations of the intensity profiles based on a variation of the Debye-Wolf approach. The enhanced SOI could thus be used as a generic means of transporting mesoscopic asymmetric particles in an optical trap without the use of complex optical beams or changing the alignment of the beam into the trap. ;Optics (physics.optics)

This new approach is based on suitable superposition of exponentially decaying Airy beams. Regarding both theoretical and numerical aspects, the results here shown are interesting because they have been quickly evaluated through a simple analytic solution, whose characteristics of propagation has agreed with those already published in literature through the use of numerical methods.

Kozlov,  Javier Nuno,  Juan Diego Ania-Castanon,  Stefan Wabnitz;"  The main subject of this contribution is the all-optical control over the state of polarization (SOP) of light, understood as the control over the SOP of a signal beam by the SOP of a pump beam. We will show how the possibility of such control arises naturally from a vectorial study of pump-probe Raman interactions in optical fibers. Most studies on the Raman effect in optical fibers assume a scalar model, which is only valid for high-PMD fibers (here, PMD stands for the polarization-mode dispersion). Modern technology enables manufacturing of low-PMD fibers, the description of which requires a full vectorial model. Within this model we gain full control over the SOP of the signal beam. In particular we show how the signal SOP is pulled towards and trapped by the pump SOP. The isotropic symmetry of the fiber is broken by the presence of the polarized pump. This trapping effect is used in experiments for the design of new nonlinear optical devices named Raman polarizers. Along with the property of improved signal amplification, these devices transform an arbitrary input SOP of the signal beam into one and the same SOP towards the output end. This output SOP is fully controlled by the SOP of the pump beam. We overview the sate-of-the-art of the subject and introduce the notion of an ""ideal Raman polarizer"". ";Optics (physics.optics)

A new class of ultra-flat optical components with high functionality can be designed by introducing abrupt phase shifts into the optical path, utilizing the resonant response of arrays of scatters with deeply-subwavelength thickness. As an application of this concept, we report a theoretical and experimental study of birefringent arrays of two-dimensional (V- and Y-shaped) optical antennas which support two orthogonal charge-oscillation modes and serve as broadband, anisotropic optical elements that can be used to locally tailor the amplitude, phase, and polarization of light. The degree of optical anisotropy can be designed by controlling the interference between the light scattered by the antenna modes; in particular, we observe a striking effect in which the anisotropy disappears as a result of destructive interference. These properties are captured by a simple, physical model in which the antenna modes are treated as independent, orthogonally-oriented harmonic oscillators. ";Optics (physics.optics)

We analyze the dipole emission patterns for both dipole orientations with respect to the symmetry axis and for different signs of dielectric constants, and show that the emission pattern is highly anisotropic and has a characteristic cross-like shape: the waves are propagating within a certain cone and are evanescent outside this cone. We demonstrate the coexistence of the cone-like pattern due to emission of the extraordinary TM-polarized waves and elliptical pattern due to emission of ordinary TE-polarized waves.

Detection of SM zero-phonon lines at ultra-low temperatures gives the values of SM natural spectral linewidth (which is inverse proportional to $T_1$) and makes it possible to reveal the distribution of the local $n$ values in solids.

Due to this symmetry one can describe topological properties of an electromagnetic field in free space and obtain the conservation law of optical (electromagnetic) helicity. What kind of the field helicity one can expect to see when the electromagnetic-field symmetry is broken? The near fields originated from small ferrite particles with magnetic dipolar mode (MDM) oscillations are the fields with the electric and magnetic components, but with broken dual (electric-magnetic) symmetry. These fields, called magnetoelectric (ME) fields, have topological properties different from such properties of electromagnetic fields. The helicity states of ME fields are topologically protected quantum like states. In this paper, we study the helicity properties of ME fields. We analyze conservation laws of the ME-field helicity and show that the helicity density is related to an imaginary part of the complex power flow density. We show also that the helicity of ME fields can be a complex value. ;Optics (physics.optics)

It therefore grants access to superficial layers only. Recently developed techniques use scattered photons for imaging by exploiting angular correlations in transmitted light and could potentially increase imaging depths. But those correlations (`angular memory effect') are of very short range and, in theory, only present behind and not inside scattering media. From measurements on neural tissues and complementary simulations, we find that strong forward scattering in biological tissues can enhance the memory effect range (and thus the possible field-of-view) by more than an order of magnitude compared to isotropic scattering for $\sim$1\,mm thick tissue layers. ;Optics (physics.optics)

In particular, the opportunity to control optoelectronic properties through tuning of Fermi level enables electro-optical modulation, optical-optical switching, and other optoelectronics applications. However, achieving a high modulation depth remains a challenge because of the modest graphene-light interaction in the graphene-silicon devices, typically, utilizing only a monolayer or few layers of graphene.

When driven by light, the optical response is dictated by geometrical parameters and the dielectric environment and plasmons are therefore extremely important for sensing applications. Plasmons in graphene disks have the additional benefit to be highly tunable via electrical stimulation. Mechanical vibrations create structural deformations in ways where the excitation of localized surface plasmons can be strongly modulated. We show that the spectral shift in such a scenario is determined by a complex interplay between the symmetry and shape of the modal vibrations and the plasmonic mode pattern. Tuning confined modes of light in graphene via acoustic excitations, paves new avenues in shaping the sensitivity of plasmonic detectors, and in the enhancement of the interaction with optical emitters, such as molecules, for future nanophotonic devices. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)"

Hosseinnia,  Philip M. Campbell,  Ali A. Eftekhar,  Eric M. Vogel,  Ali Adibi;  Layered two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) have recently attracted remarkable attention because of their unique physical properties. Here, we use photoluminescence (PL) and Raman spectroscopy to study the formation of the so- called trions in a synthesized freestanding trilayer MoS2. A trion is a charged quasi-particle formed by adding one electron or hole to a neutral exciton (a bound electron-hole pair). We demonstrate accurate control over the transformation of excitons to trions by tuning the power of the optical pump (laser). Increasing the power of the excitation laser beyond a certain threshold (~ 4 mW) allows modulation of trion-to-exciton PL intensity ratio as well as the spectral linewidth of both trions and excitons. Via a systematic and complementary Raman analysis we disclose a strong coupling between laser induced exciton-to-trion transformation and the characteristic phononic vibrations of MoS2. The onset of such an optical transformation corresponds to the onset of a previously unknown nonlinear Raman shift of the in-plane (E12g) and out-of-plane (A1g) vibrational modes. This coupling directly affects the well-known linear red-shift of the A1g and E12g vibrations due to heating at low laser powers, and changes it to a nonlinear and non-monotonic dependence with a blue-shift in the high laser power regime. Local reduction of the electron density upon exciton-to-trion transformation is found to be the underlying mechanism for the blue-shift at high laser powers. Our findings enrich our knowledge about the strong coupling of photonic and phononic properties in 2D semiconductors, and enable reliable interpretation of PL and Raman spectra in the high laser power regimes. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)"

To investigate the straightness of the isofrequency contour as well as the quasi-SC effect, we propose a straightness factor L based on the method of least squares. With L smaller than L0 (L0 = 0.01 is the critical value), the isofrequency contour is sufficiently straight to induce quasi-SC effect with the beam quasi-collimating in the structure. Furthermore, the efficiency of light coupling to the quasi-SC PC is studied, and can be greatly improved by applying a carefully designed antireflection layer. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Hastings,  David A. Reis;  X-ray scattering is a weak linear probe of matter. It is primarily sensitive to the position of electrons and their momentum distribution. Elastic X-ray scattering forms the basis of atomic structural determination while inelastic Compton scattering is often used as a spectroscopic probe of both single-particle excitations and collective modes. X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) are unique tools for studying matter on its natural time and length scales due to their bright and coherent ultrashort pulses. However, in the focus of an XFEL the assumption of a weak linear probe breaks down, and nonlinear light-matter interactions can become ubiquitous. The field can be sufficiently high that even non-resonant multiphoton interactions at hard X-rays wavelengths become relevant. Here we report the observation of one of the most fundamental nonlinear X-ray-matter interactions, the simultaneous Compton scattering of two identical photons producing a single photon at nearly twice the photon energy. We measure scattered photons with an energy near 18 keV generated from solid beryllium irradiated by 8.8-9.75 keV XFEL pulses. The intensity in the X-ray focus reaches up to 4x20 W/cm2, which corresponds to a peak electric field two orders of magnitude higher than the atomic unit of field-strength and within four orders of magnitude of the quantum electrodynamic critical field. The observed signal scales quadratically in intensity and is emitted into a non-dipolar pattern, consistent with the simultaneous two-photon scattering from free electrons. However, the energy of the generated photons shows an anomalously large redshift only present at high intensities. This indicates that the instantaneous high-intensity scattering effectively interacts with a different electron momentum distribution than linear Compton scattering, with implications for the study of atomic-scale structure and dynamics of matter ;"Optics (physics.optics); Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph); Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.00737;Single molecule imaging with longer x-ray laser pulses; Andrew V. Martin,  Justine K. Corso,  Carl Caleman,  Nicusor Timneanu,  Harry M. Quiney;"  During the last five years, serial femtosecond crystallography using x-ray laser pulses has developed into a powerful technique for determining the atomic structures of protein molecules from micrometer and sub-micrometer sized crystals. One of the key reasons for this success is the ""self-gating"" pulse effect, whereby the x-ray laser pulses do not need to outrun all radiation damage processes. Instead, x-ray induced damage terminates the Bragg diffraction prior to the pulse completing its passage through the sample, as if the Bragg diffraction was generated by a shorter pulse of equal intensity. As a result, serial femtosecond crystallography does not need to be performed with pulses as short as 5--10 fs, as once thought, but can succeed for pulses 50--100 fs in duration. We show here that a similar gating effect applies to single molecule diffraction with respect to spatially uncorrelated damage processes like ionization and ion diffusion. The effect is clearly seen in calculations of the diffraction contrast, by calculating the diffraction of average structure separately to the diffraction from statistical fluctuations of the structure due to damage (""damage noise""). Our results suggest that sub-nanometer single molecule imaging with 30--50 fs pulses, like those produced at currently operating facilities, should not yet be ruled out. The theory we present opens up new experimental avenues to measure the impact of damage on single particle diffraction, which is needed to test damage models and to identify optimal imaging conditions.

Here, we propose a strategy of realizing a high-quality plasmonic nanoparticle-in-cavity (PIC) nanoantenna array, where strong coupling between a nanoparticle dark mode with a high order nanocavity bright mode can produce Fano resonance at a target wavelength. The Fano resonance can effectively boost the CFE in the PIC, with a field enhancement factor up to 5X10^2. A cost-effective and reliable nanofabrication method is developed with room temperature nanoimprinting lithography to manufacture high-quality PIC arrays. This technique guarantees the generation of only one gold nanoparticle at the bottom of each nanocavity, which is crucial for the generation of the expected CFE. As a demonstration of the performance and application of the PIC array, it is used as active SERS substrate for detecting 4-aminothiophenol molecules. The SERS enhancement factor up to 2X10^7 is obtained experimentally, verifying the field enhancement and potential of this device. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Through numerical simulations, we investigate the propagation of apodized (finite-energy) versions of such waves, with or without vorticity, in antiguides with practical parameters. The new waves exhibit a remarkable resistance against the defocusing effect of the unstable index potentials, outperforming standard Gaussians with the same full width at half maximum. The chirped profile persists even under conditions of eccentric launching or antiguide bending and is also capable of self-healing like standard diffraction-free beams in free space. ;Optics (physics.optics)

The integrable short pulse equation is a modelling equation for ultra-short pulse propagation in the infrared range in the optical fibers. We investigate the numerical proof for the exact solitary solution of the short pulse equation. Moreover, we demonstrate that the short pulse solitons approximate the solution of the Maxwell equation numerically. Our numerical experiments prove the particle-like behaviour of the short pulse solitons. Furthermore, we derive a short pulse equation in the higher order. A stochastic counterpart of the short pulse equation is also derived through the use of the multiple scale expansion method for more realistic situations where stochastic perturbations in the dispersion are present. We numerically show that the short pulse solitary waves persist even in the presence of the randomness. The numerical schemes developed demonstrate that the statistics of the coarse-graining noise of the short pulse equation over the slow scale, and the microscopic noise of the nonlinear wave equation over the fast scale, agree to fairly good accuracy. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Measurement of the electromagnetic response of materials at microwave frequencies is important for both fundamental and practical reasons. In this paper, we propose a novel near-field microwave sensor with application to material characterization, biology, and nanotechnology. The sensor is based on a subwavelength ferrite-disk resonator with magnetic-dipolar-mode (MDM) oscillations. Strong energy concentration and unique topological structures of the near fields originated from the MDM resonators allow effective measuring material parameters in microwaves, both for ordinary structures and objects with chiral properties. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Here, we use an optical nanofiber embedded in a cloud of laser-cooled 87Rb for near-infrared frequency upconversion via a resonant two-photon process. Sub-nW powers of the two-photon beams, at 780 nm and 776 nm, co-propagate through the optical nanofiber and generation of 420 nm photons is observed. A measurement of the Autler-Townes splitting provides a direct measurement of the Rabi frequency of the 780 nm transition. Through this method, dephasings of the system can be studied. In this work, the optical nanofiber is used as an excitation and detection tool simultaneously, and it highlights some of the advantages of using fully fibered systems for nonlinear optics with atoms. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph)"

Chan;"  Pseudospin plays a central role in many novel physical properties of graphene and other artificial systems which have pseudospins of 1/2. Here we show that in certain photonic crystals (PCs) exhibiting conical dispersions at k = 0, the eigenmodes near the ""Dirac-like point"" can be described by an effective spin-orbit Hamiltonian with a pseudospin of 1, treating wave propagations in the upper cone, the lower cone and a flat band (corresponding to zero refractive index) within a unified framework. The 3-component spinor gives rise to boundary conditions distinct from those of pseudospin-1/2, leading to new wave transport behaviors as manifested in Klein tunneling and supercollimation. For example, collimation can be realized more easily with pseudospin-1 than pseudospin-1/2. The special wave scattering properties of pseudospin-1 photons, coupled with the discovery that the effective photonic ""potential"" can be varied by a simple change of length scale, may offer new ways to control photon transport.

Similarly to Bloch domain walls, such structures host a chiral charge. The numerical simulations based on a set of effective Maxwell-Bloch equations support the experimental evidence that only one sign of chiral charge is stable, which strongly affects the motion of the phase solitons. Furthermore, the reduction of the model to a modified Ginzburg Landau equation with forcing demonstrates the generality of these phenomena and exposes the impact of the lack of parity symmetry in propagative optical systems. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Miroshnichenko;  We study the light scattering by plasmonic and dielectric symmetric trimers to investigate the existence of polarization-independent Fano resonances. Plasmonic hybridization theory is revealed to hide simple physics, and we instead provide a simplified model for hybridization to derive a plasmonic trimer's eigenmodes analytically. This approach is demonstrated to accurately recreate full wave simulations of plasmonic trimers and their Fano resonances. We are subsequently able to deduce the grounds for modal interference in plasmonic trimers and the related formation of Fano resonances. However, by taking advantage of the generality of our simplified hybridization approach, we are also able to investigate the eigenmodes of all-dielectric trimers. We show that bianisotropic coupling channels between high-index dielectric nanoparticles are able to increase the capacity for Fano resonances, even at normal incidence. We finally provide the first experimental measurements of sharp, polarization-independent Fano resonances from a symmetric all-dielectric trimer, with very good agreement to the predicted response from our simplified hybridization theory. ;Optics (physics.optics)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01315;Photonic Nanojets in Optical Tweezers; Antonio Alvaro Ranha Neves;  Photonic nanojets have been brought into attention ten years ago for potential application in ultramicroscopy, because of its sub-wavelength resolution that can enhance detection and interaction with matter. For these novel applications under development, the optical trapping of a sphere acts as an ideal framework to employ photonic nanojets. In the present study, we generated nanojets by using a highly focused incident beam, in contrast to traditional plane waves. The method inherits the advantage of optical trapping, especially for intracellular applications, with the microsphere in equilibrium on the beam propagation axis and positioned arbitrarily in space. Moreover, owing to optical scattering forces, when the sphere is in equilibrium, its center shifts with respect to the focal point of the incident beam. However, when the system is in stable equilibrium with a configuration involving optical tweezers, photonic nanojets cannot be formed. To overcome this issue, we employed double optical tweezers in an unorthodox configuration involving two collinear and co-propagating beams, the precise positioning of which would turn on/off the photonic nanojets, thereby improving the applicability of photonic nanojets. ;Optics (physics.optics)

One of the basic properties of the metasurfaces, which renders them as frequency selective surfaces, is the ability to transmit or reflect radiation within a narrow spectral band that can be engineered on demand. Here we introduce and demonstrate experimentally in the THz domain the concept of wavevector selective surfaces -- metasurfaces transparent only within a narrow range of light propagation directions operating effectively as tunnel vision filters. Practical implementations of the new concept include applications in wavefront manipulation, observational instruments, vision and free-space communication in light-scattering environments, as well as passive camouflage. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Specifically, we consider solitons in a two-core guiding structure with inter-core coupling dispersion (CD). We show that CD profoundly affects properties of the solitons, causing the complete stabilization of the otherwise highly unstable spatiotemporal solitons in Kerr media with focusing nonlinearity. We also find that the presence of CD stimulates the formation of bound states, which however are unstable. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01505;First-order correction to the Casimir force within an inhomogeneous  medium; Fanglin Bao,  Bin Luo,  Sailing He;  For the Casimir piston filled with an inhomogeneous medium, the Casimir energy is regularized and expressed with cylinder kernel coefficients by using the first-order perturbation theory. When the refraction index of the medium is smoothly inhomogeneous (i.e., derivatives of all orders exist), logarithmically cutoff-dependent term in Casimir energy is found. We show that in the piston model this term vanishes in the force and thus the Casimir force is always cutoff-independent, but this term will remain in the force in the half-space model and must be removed by additional regularization. We investigate the inhomogeneity of an exponentially decaying profile, and give the first-order corrections to both free Casimir energy and Casimir force. The present method can be extended to other inhomogeneous profiles. Our results should be useful for future relevant calculations and experimental studies. ;Optics (physics.optics)

We find that non-spherical mirror shape and finite mirror size lead to loss, mode deformation, and shifted resonance frequencies at particular mirror separations. For small mirror diameters, the useful cavity length is limited to values significantly below the expected stability range. We explain the observations by resonant coupling between different transverse modes of the cavity and mode-dependent diffraction loss. A model based on resonant state expansion that takes into account the measured mirror profile can reproduce the measurements and identify the parameter regime where detrimental effects of mode mixing are avoided. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Rauschenbeutel;  Photons are nonchiral particles: their handedness can be both left and right. However, when light is transversely confined, it can locally exhibit a transverse spin whose orientation is fixed by the propagation direction of the photons. Confined photons thus have chiral character. Here, we employ this to demonstrate nonreciprocal transmission of light at the single-photon level through a silica nanofibre in two experimental schemes. We either use an ensemble of spin-polarised atoms that is weakly coupled to the nanofibre-guided mode or a single spin-polarised atom strongly coupled to the nanofibre via a whispering-gallery-mode resonator. We simultaneously achieve high optical isolation and high forward transmission. Both are controlled by the internal atomic state. The resulting optical diode is the first example of a new class of nonreciprocal nanophotonic devices which exploit the chirality of confined photons and which are, in principle, suitable for quantum information processing and future quantum optical networks. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

Chow (1) ((1) Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, (2) Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, (3) Department of Physical Electronics, School of Electrical Engineering, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel);  Previous studies of the modulation instability (MI) of continuous waves (CWs) in a two-core fiber (TCF) did not consider effects caused by co-propagation of the two polarized modes in a TCF that possesses birefringence, such as cross-phase modulation (XPM), polarization-mode dispersion (PMD), and polarization-dependent coupling (PDC) between the cores. This paper reports an analysis of these effects on the MI by considering a linear-birefringence TCF and a circular-birefringence TCF, which feature different XPM coefficients. The analysis focuses on the MI of the asymmetric CW states in the TCFs, which have no counterparts in single-core fibers. We find that, the asymmetric CW state exists when its total power exceeds a threshold (minimum) value, which is sensitive to the value of the XPM coefficient. We consider, in particular, a class of asymmetric CW states that admit analytical solutions. In the anomalous dispersion regime, without taking the PMD and PDC into account, the MI gain spectra of the birefringent TCF, if scaled by the threshold power, are almost identical to those of the zero-birefringence TCF. However, in the normal dispersion regime, the power-scaled MI gain spectra of the birefringent TCFs are distinctly different from their zero-birefringence counterparts, and the difference is particularly significant for the circular-birefringence TCF, which takes a larger XPM coefficient. On the other hand, the PMD and PDC only exert weak effects on the MI gain spectra. We also simulate the nonlinear evolution of the MI of the CW inputs in the TCFs and obtain a good agreement with the analytical solutions. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0551;Radiation pressure on a submerged absorptive partial reflector deduced  from the Doppler shift; Masud Mansuripur,  Armis R. Zakharian;"  When a light pulse is reflected from a mirror, energy and momentum are exchanged between the electromagnetic field and the material medium. The resulting change in the energy of the reflected photons is directly related to their Doppler shift arising from the change in the state of motion of the mirror. Similarly, the Doppler shift of photons that enter an absorber is intimately tied to the kinetic energy and momentum acquired by the absorber in its interaction with the incident light. The argument from the Doppler shift yields expressions for the exchanged energy and momentum that are identical with those obtained from Maxwell's equations and the Lorentz law of force, despite the fact that the physical bases of the two methods are fundamentally different. Here we apply the Doppler shift argument to a submerged partial reflector (one that absorbs a fraction of the incident light), deducing in the process the magnitude of the photon momentum within the submerging medium. We also discuss the case of the submerging medium having a negative refractive index, and show the absence of the so-called ""reversed"" Doppler shift when the reflector is detached from the negative-index medium.

Remarkably, we find the NV axis is nearly fixed inside the trap and can be controlled in-situ, by adjusting the polarization of the trapping light. By combining this unique spatial and angular control with coherent manipulation of the NV spin and fluorescent lifetime measurements near an integrated photonic system, we prove optically trapped NV center as a novel route for both 3D vectorial magnetometry and sensing of the local density of optical states. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

The HE state is highly circularly polarized as a result of a spin-preserving stimulated process, while the LE state shows a significantly reduced circular polarization because of a diminishing spin imbalance. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)"

Lagoudakis,  Jan Petykiewicz,  Thomas M. Babinec,  Jelena Vučković;  Integrated photonic devices are poised to play a key role in a wide variety of applications, ranging from optical interconnects and sensors to quantum computing. However, only a small library of semi-analytically designed devices are currently known. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of an inverse design method that explores the full design space of fabricable devices and allows us to design devices with previously unattainable functionality, higher performance and robustness, and smaller footprints compared to conventional devices. We designed a silicon wavelength demultiplexer that splits $1300~\mathrm{nm}$ and $1550~\mathrm{nm}$ light from an input waveguide into two output waveguides, and fabricated and characterized several devices. The devices display low insertion loss $\left(2 - 4~\mathrm{dB}\right)$, high contrast $\left(12 - 17~\mathrm{dB}\right)$, and wide bandwidths $\left(\sim 100~\mathrm{nm} \right)$. The device footprint is $2.8 \times 2.8 ~\mathrm{\mu m}$, making this the smallest dielectric wavelength splitter to date. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Porras;"  We investigate on the nonlinear dynamics of Airy beams in a regime where nonlinear losses due to multi-photon absorption are significant. We identify the nonlinear Airy beam (NAB) that preserves the amplitude of the inward H\""ankel component as an attractor of the dynamics. This attractor governs also the dynamics of finite-power (apodized) Airy beams, irrespective of the location of the entrance plane in the medium with respect to the Airy waist plane. A soft (linear) input long before the waist, however, strongly speeds up NAB formation and its persistence as a quasi-stationary beam in comparison to an abrupt input at the Airy waist plane, and promotes the formation of a new type of highly dissipative, fully nonlinear Airy beam not described so far.

The optical device consists of a dispersive prismatic lens made of polycarbonate designed to simultaneously concentrate the solar light and split it into its spectral components. With respect to our previous implementation, this device concentrates the light along two axes and generates a light pattern compatible with the dimensions of a set of concentrating photovoltaic cells while providing a higher concentration ratio. The mathematical framework and the constructive approach used for the design are presented and the device performance is simulated using a ray-tracing software. We obtain spectral separation in the visible range within a 3x1 cm2 area and a maximum concentration of 210x for a single wavelength. The device is fabricated by injection molding and its performance is experimentally investigated. We measure an optical transmissivity above 90% in the range 400-800 nm and we observe a spectral distribution in good accordance with simulations. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of the device for cost effective high efficiency concentrated photovoltaic systems. ;Optics (physics.optics)

The study is based on a typical configuration using circular array antennas to transmit and receive OAM waves. For any value of the OAM mode order, an original asymptotic formulation of the link budget is proposed in which equivalent antenna gains and free-space losses appear. The formulations are then validated with the results of a commercial electromagnetic simulation software. By this way, we also show how our formula can help to design a system capable of superimposing several channels on the same bandwidth and the same polarisation, based on the orthogonality of the OAM. Additional losses due to the use of this degree of freedom are notably clearly calculated to quantify the benefit and drawback according to the case. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Masudur Rahman,  Ayed Al Sayem,  Mahdy Rahman Chowdhury Mahdy,  Md. Ehsanul Haque,  Rakibul Islam,  S. Tanvir-ur-Rahman Chowdhury,  Manuel Nieto-Vesperinas,  Md. Abdul Matin;  Optical pulling with tractor beams is so far highly dependent on (i) the property of embedding background or the particle itself , (ii) the number of the particles and/or (iii) the manual ramping of beam phase. A necessary theoretical solution of these problems is proposed here. This article demonstrates a novel active tractor beam for multiple fully immersed objects with its additional abilities of yielding a controlled rotation and a desired 3D trapping. Continuous and stable long distance levitation, controlled rotation and 3D trapping are demonstrated with a single optical set-up by using two coaxial, or even non-coaxial, superimposed non-diffracting higher order Bessel beams of reverse helical nature and different frequencies. The superimposed beam has periodic intensity variations both along and around the beam-axis because of the difference in longitudinal wave-vectors and beam orders, respectively. The difference in frequencies of two laser beams makes the intensity pattern move along and around the beam-axis in a continuous way without manual ramping of phase, which allows for either linear motion (forward or backward) or angular movement (clockwise or anticlockwise) of fully immersed multiple particles. As a major contribution, the condition for increasing the target binding regions is also proposed to manipulate multiple immersed objects of different sizes and shapes. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Joannopoulos,  Marin Soljačić;"  The Dirac cone underlies many unique electronic properties of graphene and topological insulators, and its band structure--two conical bands touching at a single point--has also been realized for photons in waveguide arrays, atoms in optical lattices, and through accidental degeneracy. Deformations of the Dirac cone often reveal intriguing properties; an example is the quantum Hall effect, where a constant magnetic field breaks the Dirac cone into isolated Landau levels. A seemingly unrelated phenomenon is the exceptional point, also known as the parity-time symmetry breaking point, where two resonances coincide in both their positions and widths. Exceptional points lead to counter-intuitive phenomena such as loss-induced transparency, unidirectional transmission or reflection, and lasers with reversed pump dependence or single-mode operation. These two fields of research are in fact connected: here we discover the ability of a Dirac cone to evolve into a ring of exceptional points, which we call an ""exceptional ring."" We experimentally demonstrate this concept in a photonic crystal slab. Angle-resolved reflection measurements of the photonic crystal slab reveal that the peaks of reflectivity follow the conical band structure of a Dirac cone from accidental degeneracy, whereas the complex eigenvalues of the system are deformed into a two-dimensional flat band enclosed by an exceptional ring. This deformation arises from the dissimilar radiation rates of dipole and quadrupole resonances, which play a role analogous to the loss and gain in parity-time symmetric systems. Our results indicate that the radiation that exists in any open system can fundamentally alter its physical properties in ways previously expected only in the presence of material loss and gain.

Among the fluorescence spectroscopy techniques that can be enhanced by ZMWs, F\""{o}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is one of the most widely used in life sciences. Combining zero-mode waveguides with FRET provides new opportunities to investigate biochemical structures or follow interaction dynamics at micromolar concentration with single molecule resolution. However, prior to any quantitative FRET analysis on biological samples, it is crucial to establish first the influence of the ZMW on the FRET process. Here, we quantify the FRET rates and efficiencies between individual donor-acceptor fluorophore pairs diffusing in aluminum zero-mode waveguides. Aluminum ZMWs are important structures thanks to their commercial availability and the large literature describing their use for single molecule fluorescence spectroscopy. We also compare the results between ZMWs milled in gold and aluminum, and find that while gold has a stronger influence on the decay rates, the lower losses of aluminum in the green spectral region provide larger fluorescence brightness enhancement factors. For both aluminum and gold ZMWs, we observe that the FRET rate scales linearly with the isolated donor decay rate and the local density of optical states (LDOS). Detailed information about FRET in ZMWs unlocks their application as new devices for enhanced single molecule FRET at physiological concentrations.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.00920;Rotational cavity optomechanics; M. Bhattacharya;  We theoretically examine the optomechanical interaction between a rotating nanoparticle and an orbital angular momentum-carrying optical cavity mode. Specifically, we consider a dielectric nanosphere rotating uniformly in a ring-shaped optical potential inside a Fabry-Perot resonator. The motion of the particle is probed by a weak angular lattice, created by introducing two additional degenerate Laguerre-Gaussian cavity modes carrying equal and opposite orbital angular momenta. We demonstrate that the rotation frequency of the nanoparticle is imprinted on the probe optical mode, via the Doppler shift, and thus may be sensed experimentally using homodyne detection. We show analytically that the effect of the optical probe on the particle rotation vanishes in the regime of linear response, resulting in an accurate frequency measurement. We also numerically characterize the degradation of the measurement accuracy when the system is driven in the nonlinear regime. Our results are relevant to rotational Doppler velocimetry and to studies of rotational Brownian motion in a periodic lattice. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Two surface plasmon-polariton resonances are identified in the reflection spectrum of bare silver grooves, with the intensity of one resonance being localized near the bottom of the groove and that of the other resonance being distributed throughout the entire groove. The linear response of the hybrid silver-emitter system is thoroughly analyzed by considering the coupling between surface plasmon polaritons and emitters as the geometry of the grooves and the spatial distribution of emitters within the grooves are varied. The nonlinear response of the system is also considered by pumping the emitters with a short, high-intensity pulse. By changing the duration or the intensity of the pump, the population of emitters in the ground state at the end of the pump is varied, and it is found (upon probing with a short pulse) that an increase in the fraction of emitters in the ground state corresponds to an increase in Rabi splitting. Spatial variations in the ground state population throughout the emitter region are shown to be a result of field retardation. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.01192;Multipath Reflections Analysis on Indoor Visible Light Positioning  System; Wenjun Gu,  Mohammadreza A. Kashani,  Mohsen Kavehrad;  Visible light communication (VLC) has become a promising research topic in recent years, and finds its wide applications in indoor environments. Particularly, for location based services (LBS), visible light also provides a practical solution for indoor positioning. Multipath-induced dispersion is one of the major concerns for complex indoor environments. It affects not only the communication performance but also the positioning accuracy. In this paper, we investigate the impact of multipath reflections on the positioning accuracy of indoor VLC positioning systems. Combined Deterministic and Modified Monte Carlo (CDMMC) approach is applied to estimate the channel impulse response considering multipath reflections. Since the received signal strength (RSS) information is used for the positioning algorithm, the power distribution from one transmitter in a typical room configuration is first calculated. Then, the positioning accuracy in terms of root mean square error is obtained and analyzed. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI)"

Through conservation of energy and reciprocity, we show that each body of susceptibility $\chi$ can emit and absorb radiation at enhanced rates bounded by $|\chi|^2 / \textrm{Im} \chi$, optimally mediated by near-field photon transfer proportional to $1/d^2$ across a separation distance $d$. Dipole--dipole and dipole--plate structures approach restricted versions of the limit, but common large-area structures do not exhibit the material enhancement factor and thus fall short of the general limit. By contrast, we find that particle arrays interacting in an idealized Born approximation (i.e., neglecting multiple scattering) exhibit both enhancement factors, suggesting the possibility of orders-of-magnitude improvement beyond previous designs and the potential for radiative heat transfer to be comparable to conductive heat transfer through air at room temperature, and significantly greater at higher temperatures. ;Optics (physics.optics)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.01463;Ultrafast Optical Switching Using Photonic Molecules in Photonic Crystal  Waveguides; Yanhui Zhao,  Chenjiang Qian,  Kangsheng Qiu,  Yunan Gao,  Xiulai Xu;  We study the coupling between photonic molecules and waveguides in photonic crystal slab structures using finite-difference time-domain method and coupled mode theory. In a photonic molecule with two cavities, the coupling of cavity modes results in two super-modes with symmetric and anti-symmetric field distributions. When two super-modes are excited simultaneously, the energy of electric field oscillates between the two cavities. To excite and probe the energy oscillation, we integrate photonic molecule with two photonic crystal waveguides. In coupled structure, we find that the quality factors of two super-modes might be different because of different field distributions of super-modes. After optimizing the radii of air holes between two cavities of photonic molecule, nearly equal quality factors of two super-modes are achieved, and coupling strengths between the waveguide modes and two super-modes are almost the same. In this case, complete energy oscillations between two cavities can be obtained with a pumping source in one waveguide, which can be read out by another waveguide. Finally, we demonstrate that the designed structure can be used for ultrafast optical switching with a time scale of a few picoseconds. ;Optics (physics.optics)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.01549;Two-port multimode interference reflectors based on aluminium mirrors in  a thick SOI platform; Javier S. Fandiño,  José D. Doménech,  Pascual Muñoz;  Multimode interference reflectors (MIRs) were recently introduced as a new type of photonic integrated devices for on-chip, broadband light reflection. In the original proposal, different MIRs were demonstrated based on total internal reflection mirrors made of two deep-etched facets. Although simpler to fabricate, this approach imposes certain limits on the shape of the field pattern at the reflecting facets, which in turn restricts the types of MIRs that can be implemented. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate the use of aluminium-based mirrors for the design of 2-port MIRs with variable reflectivity. These mirrors do not impose any restrictions on the incident field, and thus give more flexibility at the design stage. Different devices with reflectivities between~0~and~0.5 were fabricated in a 3~um thick SOI platform, and characterization of multiple dies was performed to extract statistical data about their performance. Our measurements show that, on average, losses both in the aluminium mirror and in the access waveguides reduce the reflectivities to about~79\% of their target value. Moreover, standard deviations lower than $\pm$5\% are obtained over a 20~nm wavelength range (1540-1560~nm). We also provide a theoretical modelling of the aluminium mirror based on the effective index method and Fresnel equations in multilayer thin films, which shows good agreement with FDTD simulations. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Over a measurement period of about three weeks we find a weighted mean of the transferred frequency's fractional offset of $(1.1\pm0.4)\times10^{-20}$. In the best case we find an instability of $6.9\times10^{-21}$ and a fractional frequency offset of $4.4\times10^{-21}$ at an averaging time of around 30~000~s.

This is due to the transformation of spin angular momentum into orbital one. Here we demonstrate that during this scattering an anomalous force can be induced that acts in a direction perpendicular to the propagation of incident wave. The appearance of this lateral force is made possible by the presence of an interface in the vicinity of scattering object. Besides radiation pressure and tractor-beam pulling forces, this lateral force is another type of non-conservative force that can be produced with unstructured light beams. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Based on theoretical simulation, we analyze intracavity dynamics of dissipative solitons (DSs) and propose that gain fiber should be condensed to short length in order to scale the pulse energy of 2 {\mu}m DSs. The simulation predicts pulse energy of over 10 nJ for 2 {\mu}m dissipative solitons, comparable to that achieved in the 1 {\mu}m and 1.5 {\mu}m regimes. Experimental operation generates stable 2 {\mu}m DSs from a linear cavity with pulse energy of 4.9 nJ and dechirped pulse duration of 579 fs.

Benefiting from linearly-varying transverse dislocation along its axis of symmetry, this diffractive transmitter possesses extra degree of freedom in engineering broadband optical vortices meanwhile preserving a novel spiniform phase with equally spaced singularities. It unlimitedly increases the average OAM of light by embracing more singularities, which is significantly different from that for Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) and Bessel vortex beams.

The transmission lines are formed from two strips coupled either vertically or laterally. A systematic design approach is presented, that shows how different components can be integrated with each other with maximum radiation receiving nantenna efficiency, maximum coupling efficiency between nantenna and rectifier, and maximum MIM diode rectifier efficiency. The tunneling current of the rectifier is calculated using the transfer matrix method (TMM) and the nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF). The figures of merit of the rectifier are analyzed, and the effect of the metals and insulator choices on these merits is investigated. A detailed parametric study of the coupled strips plasmonic transmission lines is presented and thoroughly discussed. The overall efficiencies of the proposed travelling wave rectennas are fully expressed and compared. Due to the extremely small spacing between its two strips, the nanodipole terminated by vertical coupled strips plasmonic transmission line offers significantly higher efficiency than that terminated by a lateral coupled strips line. However, the overall efficiency of the vertical coupled strips rectenna is still very low due to the extremely low efficiency of the MIM rectifier. ;Optics (physics.optics)

These structures are intrinsically two-way optical communication channels, providing two opposite light propagation directions. As a consequence, when light is coupled to these planar integrated devices directly from the top (or bottom) surface using strongly focused beams, it is equally shared into the two opposite propagation directions. Here, we show that symmetry can be broken by using incident circularly polarized light, on the basis of a spin-orbital angular momentum transfer directly within waveguide bends. We predict that up to 94 \% of the incoupled light is directed into a single propagation channel of a gap plasmon waveguide. Unidirectional propagation of strongly localized optical energy, far beyond the diffraction limit, becomes switchable by polarization, with no need of intermediate nano-antennas/scatterers as light directors.

Malomed,  Gershon Kurizki;  Nonlinear optical propagation in cholesteric liquid crystals (CLC) with a spatially periodic helical molecular structure is studied experimentally and modeled numerically. This periodic structure can be seen as a Bragg grating with a propagation stopband for circularly polarized light. The CLC nonlinearity can be strengthened by adding absorption dye, thus reducing the nonlinear intensity threshold and the necessary propagation length. As the input power increases, a blue shift of the stopband is induced by the self-defocusing nonlinearity, leading to a substantial enhancement of the transmission and spreading of the beam. With further increase of the input power, the self-defocusing nonlinearity saturates, and the beam propagates as in the linear-diffraction regime. A system of nonlinear couple-mode equations is used to describe the propagation of the beam. Numerical results agree well with the experiment findings, suggesting that modulation of intensity and spatial profile of the beam can be achieved simultaneously under low input intensities in a compact CLC-based micro-device. ;Optics (physics.optics)

We show that due to the coupling of electronic edge states for the zigzag nanoribbon structure, the Fermi surface can become a hyperbola similarly to the case of the layered metal-dielectric structures, where the hyperbolic isofrequency contours originate from the coupling of localized surface plasmon polaritons. Moreover, we show that for both types of the ribbon edge, the optical response of the structure can be characterized by a uniaxial conductivity tensor, having principal components of the different signs. Therefore, the tunnel-coupled nanoribbon array can be regarded as a tunable hyperbolic metasurface. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)"

By employing dual-excitation Fourier microscopy with spatially filtered collection-optics, we show single- and dual-directional out-coupling of light from NW-NP junction for plasmons excited through glass-substrate and air-superstrate. Furthermore, we show NW-NP junction can influence the directionality of molecular-fluorescence emission, thus functioning as an optical antenna. The results discussed herein may have implications in realizing directional single-photon sources and quantum plasmon circuitry. ;Optics (physics.optics)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.02231;Quasi-guiding modes in microfibers on high refractive index substrate; Kaiyang Wang,  Zhiyuan Gu,  Wenzhao Sun,  Jiankai Li,  Shumin Xiao,  Qinghai Song;  Light confinement and amplification in micro- & nano-fiber have been intensively studied and a number of applications have been developed. However, the typical micro- & anno- fibers are usually free-standing or positioned on a substrate with lower refractive index to ensure the light confinement and guiding mode. Here we numerically and experimentally demonstrate the possibility of confining light within a microfiber on a high refractive index substrate. In contrast to the strong leaky to the substrate, we found that the radiation loss was dependent on the radius of microfiber and the refractive index contrast. Consequently, quasi-guiding modes could be formed and the light could propagate and be amplified in such systems. By fabricating tapered silica fiber and dye-doped polymer fiber and placing them on sapphire substrates, the light propagation, amplification, and laser behaviors have been experimentally studied to verify the quasi-guiding modes in microfer with higher index substrate. We believe that our research will be essential for the applications of micro- and nano-fibers. ;Optics (physics.optics)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.02503;Determining the Phase and Amplitude Distortion of a Wavefront using a  Plenoptic Sensor; Chensheng Wu,  Jonathan Ko,  Christopher C. Davis;  We have designed a plenoptic sensor to retrieve phase and amplitude changes resulting from a laser beam's propagation through atmospheric turbulence. Compared with the commonly restricted domain of (-pi, pi) in phase reconstruction by interferometers, the reconstructed phase obtained by the plenoptic sensors can be continuous up to a multiple of 2pi. When compared with conventional Shack-Hartmann sensors, ambiguities caused by interference or low intensity, such as branch points and branch cuts, are less likely to happen and can be adaptively avoided by our reconstruction algorithm. In the design of our plenoptic sensor, we modified the fundamental structure of a light field camera into a mini Keplerian telescope array by accurately cascading the back focal plane of its object lens with a microlens array's front focal plane and matching the numerical aperture of both components. Unlike light field cameras designed for incoherent imaging purposes, our plenoptic sensor operates on the complex amplitude of the incident beam and distributes it into a matrix of images that are simpler and less subject to interference than a global image of the beam. Then, with the proposed reconstruction algorithms, the plenoptic sensor is able to reconstruct the wavefront and a phase screen at an appropriate depth in the field that causes the equivalent distortion on the beam. The reconstructed results can be used to guide adaptive optics systems in directing beam propagation through atmospheric turbulence. In this paper we will show the theoretical analysis and experimental results obtained with the plenoptic sensor and its reconstruction algorithms. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det)"

Our experiments demonstrated strong influence of a laser beam orientation on self-focusing of the beam and plasma generation during filamentation. Maximum of linear plasma density generated by an astigmatic laser pulse was different in both meridional and sagittal foci and depended on the beam orientation. A difference of linear plasma density was observed in the case of superposition of two parts of the laser beam going through a two-hole diaphragm depending on the beam orientation and through a slit for collinear and normal slit orientation relative to the beam orientation. Laser pulses in IR and UV wavelength domains led to similar result. ;Optics (physics.optics)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.02705;Coupling Mode of Dual-Core Micro Structured Fibers; Mohammed Debbal,  Mohammed Chikh-Bled;  The photonic crystal fibers (PCF) or air-silica microstructured fibers consist of a periodic array of dielectric transverse. By introducing a defect in this structure, it is possible to guide the light by a photonic bandgap effect, whose properties are different fundamentally from the guide by total internal reflection that takes place in conventional fibers. PCF with two cores have significant potential, and this is one of the main motivations witches led us to approach this theme in this article. Analysis of the inter-core coupling was also necessary to study the problem of crosstalk. Their knowledge is important because it is a preliminary work to the study and understanding of multi-core PCF or an array of guides in the microstructured cladding. It then presents the main results on the effects of beating between the various modes under linear conditions. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Linfield,  Francesco Pagliano,  Andrea Fiore,  Francesca Intonti,  Massimo Gurioli;  Arrays of photonic cavities are relevant structures for developing large-scale photonic integrated circuits and for investigating basic quantum electrodynamics phenomena, due to the photon hopping between interacting nanoresonators. Here, we investigate, by means of scanning near-field spectroscopy, numerical calculations and an analytical model, the role of different neighboring interactions that give rise to delocalized supermodes in different photonic crystal array configurations. The systems under investigation consist of three nominally identical two-dimensional photonic crystal nanocavities on membrane aligned along the two symmetry axes of the triangular photonic crystal lattice. We find that the nearest and next-nearest-neighbour coupling terms can be of the same relevance. In this case, a non-intuitive picture describes the resonant modes, and the photon hopping between adjacent nano-resonators is strongly affected. Our findings prove that exotic configurations and even post-fabrication engineering of coupled nanoresonators could directly tailor the mode spatial distribution and the group velocity in coupled resonator optical waveguides. ;Optics (physics.optics)

To do this, we used the vector addition form for the law of propagation, the exponential of an imaginary vector form for the law of refraction, and the juxtaposed vector product form for the law of reflection. In particular, the exponential forms of the vector rotations enables us to take advantage of the addition or subtraction of exponential arguments of two rotated vectors in the derivation of the ray tracing invariants in cylindrical and spherical coordinates. We showed that the light rays inside the optical fiber trace a polygonal helical path characterized by three invariants that relate successive reflections inside the fiber: the ray path distance, the difference in axial distances, and the difference in the azimuthal angles. We also rederived the known generalized formula for the numerical aperture for skew rays, which simplifies to the standard form for meridional rays. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Yousefi;  Marcatili's famous approximate analytical description of light propagating through rectangular dielectric waveguides, published in 1969, gives accurate results for low-index-contrast waveguides. However, photonic integrated circuit technology has advanced to high-index-contrast (HIC) waveguides. In this paper, we improve Marcatili's model by adjusting the amplitudes of the components of the electromagnetic fields in his description. We find that Marcatili's eigenvalue equation for the propagation constant is also valid for HIC waveguides. Our improved method shows much better agreement with rigorous numerical simulations, in particular for the case of HIC waveguides. We also derive explicit expressions for the effective group index and the effects of external forces on the propagation constant. Furthermore, with our method the phenomenon of avoided crossing of modes is observed and studied. ;Optics (physics.optics)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.03057;Doppler shift generated by diffraction gratings under time-dependent  incidence angle near a Wood anomaly; Kokou B. Dossou;  Diffraction gratings are famous for their ability to exhibit, near a Wood anomaly, an arbitrarily large angular dispersion, e.g., with respect to the incidence angle or wavelength. For a diffraction grating under incidence by a plane wave at a fixed frequency, by rotating the incidence angle at a given angular velocity, the field propagated by a nonzero diffraction order will rotate at increasingly fast angular velocity as the incidence angle approaches the angle where Wood anomaly occurs. Such a fast rotating diffracted field has the potential to generate a substantial Doppler shift. Indeed, under the assumption of a grating with infinite extent, the expression for the instantaneous frequency shift perceived by an observer, who is looking into the light radiated by the diffraction order, is derived and it is in full agreement with the prediction from an interpretation based on the Doppler shift generated by a rotation of light sources. In particular the classical (non-relativistic) Doppler shift can take arbitrarily high values as the incidence angle approaches a Wood anomaly. It is also found that gratings of a finite size can have a similar property. In order to have a physically detectable frequency shift, it is important to use a grating which can maintain a significant reflectance into higher diffraction orders near their Wood anomaly cut-off. Interestingly, we have found that the geometry of the nanostructures of a \emph{Morpho} butterfly wing scale is aptly suited for such a function because it can strongly reflect into higher diffraction orders while minimising the reflection into the specular order. ;Optics (physics.optics)

The values used for these charges are obtained from the measured capacitance-voltage (C-V) characteristics of SiO2, SiNx, and Al2O3 thin films deposited on silicon substrates. The effect of the charges on the properties of silicon waveguides is then calculated using the semiconductor physics tool Silvaco in combination with the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method solver Lumerical. Our results show that, in addition to being a critical factor in the analysis of such active devices as capacitively-driven silicon modulators, this effect should also be taken into account when considering the propagation losses of passive silicon waveguides. ;Optics (physics.optics)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.03086;Localization of states, Bloch wave and quantum phase transitions in SUSY  deformed potentials in non-Hermitian optical systems; Muhammad Imran Afzal,  Yong Tak Lee;  For the first time, we have observed the annihilation of multiple eigenstates of the parent potentials and redistribution of the energy in the deformed potentials in the system with spontaneously breaking of parity-time symmetry while preserving the SUSY of the system. We have observed that the deformation of the potentials is sensitive to initial conditions. This first experimental observation enables the localization of eigenspectra in lateral space (so-called time) and the localization of eigenstates in longitudinal space in the deformed potentials by experimentally applying the SUSY higher-order transformations on tilted and disordered parent potentials, respectively. The former shows a decrease in the slope of the profile of eigenspectrum (bands) due to the localization in lateral space, while the latter shows an increase in the slope due to localization in longitudinal space. This allows the formation of deterministic bandgaps and Bloch waves while retaining the SUSY. In this configuration, the phase transition emerges naturally in the SUSY deformed potentials, which are revealed as the quantum Zeno effect and a peculiar Anderson localization, respectively. The Anderson localization shows the features of effective amplification and quantum Anti-Zeno effect. The experimental results are in full agreement with the theory of SUSY deformed potentials of higher-order transformations. Besides enhancing the understanding of nature, our results can also provide an experimental platform to originate new classes of effective and synthetic materials, and are also significantly important for unifying the interaction dynamics of condensed matter and photonic systems, and the implementation of universal quantum computation. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.03113;Transverse and longitudinal angular momenta of light; Konstantin Y. Bliokh,  Franco Nori;  We review basic physics and novel types of optical angular momentum. We start with a theoretical overview of momentum and angular momentum properties of generic optical fields, and discuss methods for their experimental measurements. In particular, we describe the well-known longitudinal (i.e., aligned with the mean momentum) spin and orbital angular momenta in polarized vortex beams. Then, we focus on the transverse (i.e., orthogonal to the mean momentum) spin and orbital angular momenta, which were recently actively discussed in theory and observed in experiments. First, the recently-discovered transverse spin angular momenta appear in various structured fields: evanescent waves, interference fields, and focused beams. We show that there are several kinds of transverse spin angular momentum, which differ strongly in their origins and physical properties. We describe extraordinary features of the transverse optical spins and overview recent experiments. In particular, the helicity-independent transverse spin inherent in edge evanescent waves offers robust spin-direction coupling at optical interfaces (the quantum spin Hall effect of light). Second, we overview the transverse orbital angular momenta of light, which can be both extrinsic and intrinsic. These two types of the transverse orbital angular momentum are produced by spatial shifts of the optical beams (e.g., in the spin Hall effect of light) and their Lorentz boosts, respectively. Our review is underpinned by a unified theory of the angular momentum of light based on the canonical momentum and spin densities, which avoids complications associated with the separation of spin and orbital angular momenta in the Poynting picture. It allows us to construct comprehensive classification of all known optical angular momenta based on their key parameters and main physical properties. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Tredicucci;  This work reports the dynamical thermal behavior of lasing microspheres placed on a dielectric substrate while they are homogeneously heated-up by the top-pump laser used to excite the active medium. The lasing modes are collected in the far-field and their temporal spectral traces show characteristic lifetimes of about 2 ms. The latter values scale with the microsphere radius and are independent of the pump power in the studied range. Finite-Element Method simulations reproduce the experimental results, revealing that the thermal dynamics is dominated by the heat dissipated towards the substrate through the medium surrounding the contact point. The characteristic system scale regarding thermal transport is of few hundreds of nanometers, thus enabling an effective toy model for investigating heat conduction in non-continuum gaseous media and near-field radiative energy transfer. ;Optics (physics.optics)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.03148;Elimination of polarization degeneracy in circularly symmetric  bianisotropic waveguides: a decoupled case; Jing Xu,  Bingbing Wu,  Yuntian Chen;  Mode properties of circularly symmetric waveguides with one special type of bianisotropy are studied using finite element approach. We find that the polarization degeneracy in circularly symmetric waveguides can be eliminated, by introducing intrinsic crossing coupling between electric and magnetic moments in the constituent units of the waveguide media. Breaking the polarization degeneracy in high order mode groups is also confirmed numerically. With the bianisotropic parameters chosen in this work, the x and y-polarized modes remain decoupled. Typically, the y-polarized modes remain completely unchanged, while the x-polarized modes are turned into leaky modes that are lossy along propagation direction. A perturbation model from coupled mode theory is developed to explain the results and shows excellent agreement. Such asymmetric behavior between different polarizations might be feasible and useful for developing compact polarizers in terahertz or mid-infrared regime. ;Optics (physics.optics)

The mathematical modeling of these local fluctuations of dielectric properties of fibers was performed by Gaussian functions. By simulating soliton wave propagation in optical fibers with Gaussian fluctuations in their dielectric properties, it was observed that the perturbed soliton numerical solution presented higher sensitivity to fluctuations in the dielectric parameter $\beta$, a measure of the intensity of nonlinearity in the fiber. In order to verify whether the fluctuations of $\beta$ parameter in the splices of the optical fiber generate unstable solitons, the propagation of a soliton wave, subject to this perturbation, was simulated for large time intervals. Considering various geometric configurations and intensities of the fluctuations of parameter $\beta$, it was found that the perturbed soliton wave stabilizes, i.e., the amplitude of the wave oscillations decreases for increasing values of propagation distance. It is concluded that the propagation of perturbed soliton wave presents numerical stability when subjected to local Gaussian fluctuations (perturbations) of the dielectric parameters of the optical fiber. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS); Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.03266;Modelling Thermoelastic Distortion of Optics Using Elastodynamic  Reciprocity; Eleanor King,  Yuri Levin,  David Ottaway,  Peter Veitch;"  Thermoelastic distortion resulting from optical absorption by transmissive and reflective optics can cause unacceptable changes in optical systems that employ high power beams. In advanced-generation laser-interferometric gravitational wave detectors for example, optical absorption is expected to result in wavefront distortions that would compromise the sensitivity of the detector; thus necessitating the use of adaptive thermal compensation. Unfortunately, these systems have long thermal time constants and so predictive feed-forward control systems could be required - but the finite-element analysis is computationally expensive. We describe here the use of the Betti-Maxwell elastodynamic reciprocity theorem to calculate the response of linear elastic bodies (optics) to heating that has arbitrary spatial distribution. We demonstrate using a simple example, that it can yield accurate results in computational times that are significantly less than those required for finite-element analyses.

The derived expressions are used to analyze spectral properties of the resonator-particle system as functions of the particle's position, the size of the resonators and the characteristics of WGMs. The obtained results are shown to agree well with available experimental data. It is also demonstrated that the particle-induced spectral effects can be significantly enhanced by careful selection of resonator's size, refractive index and other experimental parameters. The results presented in the paper can be useful for applications of WGM resonators in biosensing, cavity QED, optomechanics and others. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Saifur Rahman;  In this article, a few-layered graphene-dielectric multilayer (metamaterial) electro-optic modulator has been proposed in the mid and far infrared range that works on electro-absorption mechanism. Graphene, both mono layer and few layer, is an actively tunable optical material that allows control of inter-band and intra-band transition by tuning its chemical potential. Utilizing this unique feature of graphene, we propose a multilayer graphene dielectric stack where few layer graphene is preferred over mono layer graphene. Although the total thickness of the stack still remains in the nanometer range, this device can exhibit superior performances in terms of (i) high modulation depth, (ii) ultra-broadband performance, (iii) ultra-low insertion loss due to inherent metamaterial properties, (iv) nanoscale footprint, (v) polarization independence and (vi) capability of being integrated to a silicon waveguide. Interestingly, these superior performances, achievable by using few layer graphene with carefully designed metamaterial, may not be possible with mono layer graphene.

While most of single-mode lasers in coupled microdisks or microrings have been qualitatively explained by either Vernier effect or inversed Vernier effect, none of them have been experimentally confirmed. Here, we studied the mechanism for single-mode operation in coupled microdisks. We found that the mode numbers had been significantly reduced to nearly single-mode within a large pumping power range from threshold to gain saturation. The detail laser spectra showed that the largest gain and the first lasing peak were mainly generated by one disk and the laser intensity was proportional to the frequency detuning. The corresponding theoretical analysis showed that the experimental observations were dominated by internal coupling within one cavity, which was similar to the recently explored inversed Vernier effect in two coupled microrings. We believe our finding will be important for understanding the previous experimental findings and the development of on-chip single-mode laser. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Here, we describe a counter-intuitive lateral optical force acting on particles placed above a substrate, under uniform plane wave illumination without any field gradients. We show that under circularly-polarized illumination, nanoparticles experience a lateral force as a result of dipolar, spin-sensitive scattering, with a magnitude comparable to other optical forces. To this end, we rigorously calculate the force experienced by a circularly polarized dipole radiating above a surface. Unlike for linearly-polarized dipoles, force components parallel to the surface can exist, caused by the recoil of unidirectional guided modes excited at the surface and/or by dipole-dipole interactions with the induced image dipole.

However, its practical applications in quantum physics and information science are limited due to rigid experimental requirements. Here, we demonstrate a new mechanism of optically induced transparency in a micro-cavity by introducing a four-wave mixing gain to nonlinearly couple two separated resonances of the micro-cavity in an ambient environment. A signature Fano-like resonance was observed owing to the nonlinear interference of the two coupled resonances. Moreover, we show that the unidirectional gain of the four-wave mixing can lead to the remarkable effect of non-reciprocal transmission at the transparency windows. Optically induced transparency may offer a unique platform for a compact, integrated solution to all-optical and quantum information. ;Optics (physics.optics)

This allows seamless integration of photonic and electronic design in a single environment. The tool leverages intuitive photonic layer definitions, allowing the designer to focus on the physical properties rather than on technology-dependent details. For the first time the authors present an algorithm for removal of design-rule violations from photonic layouts based on Manhattan discretisation, Boolean and sizing operations. This algorithm is not limited to the implementation in SKILL, and can in principle be implemented in any scripting language.

We propose a hyperbolic metamaterial for fabrication with STED-DLW. First, we design meandering wire structures with three different magnetic dipoles which can be excited under different incidences of light. Then, based on effective parameters corresponding to normal incidence and lateral incidence, we find that the hyperbolic dispersion relation for five-layer structure appears between 15THz to 20THz. Finally, we investigate the influence of imaginary parts of the effective parameters on the metamaterial dispersion. The proposed metamaterial structure has also potential for three-dimensionally isotropic permeability despite geometric anisotropy. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Lee,  Yogesh N. Joglekar;  Aubry-Andre Harper (AAH) lattice models, characterized by reflection-asymmetric, sinusoidally varying nearest-neighbor tunneling profile, are well-known for their topological properties. We consider the fate of such models in the presence of balanced gain and loss potentials $\pm i\gamma$ located at reflection-symmetric sites. We predict that these models have a finite $\mathcal{PT}$ breaking threshold only for {\it specific locations} of the gain-loss potential, and uncover a hidden symmetry that is instrumental to the finite threshold strength. We also show that the topological edge-states remain robust in the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry broken phase. Our predictions substantially broaden the possible realizations of a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric system. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.03823;Efficient single pixel imaging in Fourier space; Liheng Bian,  Jinli Suo,  Xuemei Hu,  Feng Chen,  Qionghai Dai;  Single pixel imaging (SPI) is a novel technique being able to capture 2D images using a bucket detector with high signal-to-noise ratio, wide spectrum range and low cost. Conventional SPI projects random illumination patterns to randomly and uniformly sample the entire scene's information. Determined by the Nyquist sampling theory, SPI needs either numerous projections or high computation cost to reconstruct the target scene, especially for high-resolution cases. To address this issue, we propose an efficient single pixel imaging technique (eSPI), which instead projects sinusoidal patterns for importance sampling of the target scene's spatial spectrum in Fourier space. Specifically, utilizing the centrosymmetric conjugation and sparsity priors of natural images' spatial spectra, eSPI sequentially projects two $\frac{\pi}{2}$-phase-shifted sinusoidal patterns to obtain each Fourier coefficient in the most informative spatial frequency bands. eSPI can reduce requisite patterns by two orders of magnitude compared to conventional SPI, which helps a lot for fast and high-resolution SPI. ;Optics (physics.optics)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.03865;Unphysical metastability of the fundamental Raman soliton in the reduced  nonlinear Schroedinger equation; Truong X. Tran,  Fabio Biancalana;  We demonstrate theoretically and numerically that the fundamental Raman soliton of the widely used nonlinear Schroedinger equation (NLSE) with a linear approximation of the Raman gain ({\em reduced} NLSE) is metastable. It can propagate for hundreds of dispersion lengths along the optical fibre before eventually disappearing due to a peculiar instability, leading to a collapse. The noise eigenfunction analysis agrees well with the results obtained via direct pulse propagation simulations. This instability is not present when modelling the Raman effect via a full convolution, and thus the reduced NLSE often leads to unphysical results, and should be avoided. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.04026;Femtosecond-scale switching based on excited free-carriers; Y. Sivan,  G. Ctistis,  E. Yuce,  A.P. Mosk;  We describe novel optical switching schemes operating at femtosecond time scales by employing free carrier (FC) excitation. Such unprecedented switching times are made possible by spatially patterning the density of the excited FCs. In the first realization, we rely on diffusion, i.e., on the nonlocality of the FC nonlinear response of the semiconductor, to erase the initial FC pattern and, thereby, eliminate the reflectivity of the system. In the second realization, we erase the FC pattern by launching a second pump pulse at a controlled delay. We discuss the advantages and limitations of the proposed approaches and demonstrate their potential applicability for switching ultrashort pulses propagating in silicon waveguides. We show switching efficiencies of up to $50\%$ for $100$ fs pump pulses, which is an unusually high level of efficiency for such a short interaction time, a result of the use of the strong FC nonlinearity. Due to limitations of saturation and pattern effects, these schemes can be employed for switching applications that require femtosecond features but standard repetition rates. Such applications include switching of ultrashort pulses, femtosecond spectroscopy (gating), time-reversal of short pulses for aberration compensation, and many more. This approach is also the starting point for ultrafast amplitude modulations and a new route toward the spatio-temporal shaping of short optical pulses. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Sola;  We present observations of the emission of XUV continua in the 20-37 eV region by high harmonic generation (HHG) with $4$-$7\ \mathrm{fs}$ pulses focused onto a Kr gas jet. The underlying mechanism relies on coherent control of the relative delays and phases between individually generated attosecond pulse, achievable by adjusting the chirp of the driving pulses and the interaction geometry. Under adequate negative chirp and phase matching conditions, the resulting interpulse interference yields a continuum XUV spectrum, which is due to both microscopic and macroscopic (propagation) contributions. This technique opens the route for modifying the phase of individual attosecond pulses and for the coherent synthesis of XUV continua from multicycle driving laser pulses without the need of an isolated attosecond burst. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Poddubny,  Evgenii E. Narimanov,  Mikhail A. Noginov;"  Optical cavities, plasmonic structures, photonic band crystals, interfaces, as well as, generally speaking, any photonic media with homogeneous or spatially inhomogeneous dielectric permittivity (including metamaterials) have local densities of photonic states, which are different from that in vacuum. These modified density of states environments are known to control both the rate and angular distribution of spontaneous emission. In the present study, we ask the question whether the proximity to metallic and metamaterial surfaces can affect other physical phenomena of fundamental and practical importance. We show that the same substrates and the same nonlocal dielectric environments that boost spontaneous emission, also inhibit F\""orster energy transfer between donor and acceptor molecules doped into a thin polymeric film. This finding correlates with the fact that in dielectric media, the rate of spontaneous emission is proportional to the index of refraction n, while the rate of the donor-acceptor energy transfer (in solid solutions with random distribution of acceptors) is proportional to n^-1.5. This heuristic correspondence suggests that other classical and quantum phenomena, which in regular dielectric media depend on n, can also be controlled with custom-tailored metamaterials, plasmonic structures, and cavities.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.04129;Analysis of Cascaded Brillouin Scattering in Optical Fibres; Neil G. R. Broderick,  Stephane X. Coen;  Cascaded Brillouin scattering is increasingly becoming of interest in many areas of pho- tonics (e.g. see [1] and [2]) and has been studied experimentally by many groups. In gain assisted experiments for example up to nearly 800 distinct lines have been observed[3] while in passive cavities, mode locking of a few Brillouin lines has recently been demonstrated[4]. We show that although each pair of lines interact through the creation of an acoustic phonon the resulting acoustic field nevertheless can be written as the sum of only two waves (a forward and backward propagating wave). This new analysis results in a set of strongly coupled amplitude equations for the fields that are derived here for the first time in the context of optical fibres. More-over we show that previous authors have mis- understood the nature of the acoustic field resulting in incorrect sets of coupled equations. ;Optics (physics.optics)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.04228;Experimental observation of melting of the effective Minkowski spacetime  in cobalt-based ferrofluids; Igor I. Smolyaninov,  Vera N. Smolyaninova;  Hyperbolic metamaterials were originally introduced to overcome the diffraction limit of optical imaging. Soon thereafter it was realized that they demonstrate a number of novel phenomena resulting from the broadband singular behavior of their density of photonic states. These novel phenomena and applications include microscopy, stealth technologies, enhanced quantum-electrodynamic effects, thermal hyperconductivity, superconductivity, and interesting gravitation theory analogues. Here we describe the behaviour of cobalt nanoparticle-based ferrofluid in the presence of an external magnetic field, and demonstrate that it forms a self-assembled hyperbolic metamaterial, which may be described as an effective 3D Minkowski spacetime for extraordinary photons. Moreover, such photons perceive thermal gradients in the ferrofluid as analogue of gravitational field, which obeys the Newton law. If the magnetic field is not strong enough, the effective Minkowski spacetime gradually melts under the influence of thermal fluctuations. On the other hand, it may restore itself if the magnetic field is increased back to its original value. Direct microscopic visualization of such a Minkowski spacetime melting/crystallization is presented, which is somewhat similar to hypothesized formation of the Minkowski spacetime in loop quantum cosmology and may mimic various cosmological Big Bang scenarios. ;"Optics (physics.optics); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)"

We define a generalized Wigner function, compute a Fokker-Planck equation that approximates the master equation, and convert this to a system of stochastic differential equations. These equations are similar to the Wigner equations for an optical Kerr cavity, but have additional noise terms due to the incoherent carrier excitation and decay processes.

We simulate this device using semiclassical Langevin equations and assess the effect of quantum fluctuations on the dynamics. Below threshold, the cavity acts as a phase-insensitive linear amplifier, with noise $\sim 5\times$ larger than the Caves bound. Above threshold, the limit cycle acts as an analog memory, and the phase diffusion is $\sim 10\times$ larger than the bound set by the standard quantum limit.

With equal-power linearly polarized beams incident on each side of the surface, varying the relative phase rotates the polarization angles of the output beams, while keeping the polarization exactly linear. The explanation is based on coupled-mode theory and the idea of coherent perfect absorption into auxiliary polarization channels. The polarization-rotating behavior occurs at a critical point of the coupled-mode theory, which can be associated with the exceptional point of a parity-time (PT) symmetric effective Hamiltonian. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)"

By introducing the time-correlated single-photon counting technique, we investigated the temporal histogram of the detection counts of an SNSPD under illumination. The temporal information helps us to distinguish photon counts from dark counts in the time domain. In this manner, the dark count rate (DCR) under illumination and the accurate SDE can be determined. The DCR under moderate illumination may be significantly larger than the conventional DCR measured without illumination under a high Ib, which causes the abnormal increase in the SDE. The increased DCR may be explained by the suppression of Isw under illumination. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con); Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det)"

His theory includes the nonlinear interaction between multipolar surface oscillation modes, surpassing the linear theory of Rayleigh and Lamb. It predicts a specific normalized magnitude of $0.41\dot{6}\eta^2$ for an octapolar component, nonlinearly induced by a quadrupolar one with a magnitude of $\eta$ much less than unity. No experimental confirmation on this prediction has been reported. Nonetheless, accurate determination of multipolar components is important as in optical fiber spinning, film blowing and recently in optofluidic microcavities for ray and wave chaos studies and photonics applications. Here, we report experimental verification of his theory. By using optical forward diffraction, we measured the cross-sectional boundary profiles at extreme positions of a surface-oscillating liquid column ejected from a deformed microscopic orifice. We obtained a coefficient of $0.42\pm0.08$ consistently under various experimental conditions. We also measured the resonance mode spectrum of a two-dimensional cavity formed by the cross-sectional segment of the liquid jet. The observed spectra agree well with wave calculations assuming a coefficient of $0.415\pm0.010$.

Our results show that the conventional focusing with the focal lens completely filled with the incident beam allows for the strongest axial intensity confinement against the self-focusing effect. This is because that in the high-numerical-aperture condition, the focal spot will have a compact size which results in a high focal intensity. Meanwhile, the Rayleigh length of the focused beam will be substantially shortened which efficiently postpones the onset of self-focusing. ;Optics (physics.optics)

The MSIS consists of multiple SIS subcells. The dispersion relationship of the fundamental guided mode of the spoof surface plasmon polaritons (SSPPs) is studied analytically within the small gap approximation. It is shown that the multiscale SIS possesses microwave band gap (MBG) due to the Bragg scattering. The ""gap maps"" in the design parameter space are provided. We demonstrate that the geometry of the subcells can efficiently adjust the effective refraction index of the elementary SIS and therefore further control the width and the position of the MBG. The results are in good agreement with numerical calculations by the finite element method (FEM). For finite-sized MSIS of given geometry in the millimeter scale, FEM calculations show that the first-order symmetric SSPP mode has zero transmission in the MBG within frequency range from 4.29 GHz to 5.1 GHz. A cavity mode is observed inside the gap at 4.58 GHz, which comes from a designer ""point defect"" in the multiscale SIS waveguide. Furthermore, ultrathin MSIS waveguides are shown to have both symmetric and antisymmetric modes with their own MBGs, respectively.

Thiel,  Morteza Shahpari,  Jan Hettenhausen,  Andrew Lewis;  Use of an optimization algorithm to improve performance of antennas and electromagnetic structures usually ends up in planar unusual shapes. Using rectangular conducting elements the proposed structures sometimes have connections with only one single point in common between two neighboring areas. The single point connections (point crossing) can affect the electromagnetic performance of the structure. In this letter, we illustrate the influence of point crossing on dipole and loop antennas using MoM, FDTD, and FEM solvers. Current distribution, radiation pattern, and impedance properties for different junctions are different. These solvers do not agree in the modeling of the point crossing junctions which is a warning about uncertainty in using such junctions. However, solvers agree that a negligible change in the junction would significantly change the antenna performance. We propose that one should consider both bridging and chamfering of the conflicting cells to find optimized structures. This reduces the simulation time by 40% using FDTD modeling, however no significant reduction is obtained using the MoM and FEM methods. ;Optics (physics.optics)

However, a large parasitic absorption in those structures is unavoidable. Most schemes based on such structures also involve the textured active layers that may bring undesirable degradation of the material quality. Here we propose a novel and cheap light trapping structure based on the prism structured SiO2 for thin-film solar cells, and a flat active layer is introduced purposefully. Such a light trapping structure is imposed by the geometrical shape optimization to gain the best optical benefit. By examining our scheme, it is disclosed that the conversion efficiency of the flat a-Si:H thin-film solar cell can be promoted to exceed the currently certified highest value. As the cost of SiO2-based light trapping structure is much cheaper and easier to fabricate than other materials, this proposal would have essential impact and wide applications in thin-film solar cells. ;Optics (physics.optics)

However, for active systems this idealization may be dangerous due to the presence of growing waves. Here we consider a gainy slab, and use a realistic incident beam, which is both causal and has finite width. This clarifies some apparent paradoxes arising from earlier analyses of this setup. In general it turns out to be necessary to involve complex frequencies $\omega$ and/or complex transversal wavenumbers $k_x$. Simultaneously real $\omega$ and $k_x$ cannot describe amplified waves in a slab which is infinite in the transversal direction. We also show that the only possibility to have an absolute instability for a finite width beam, is if a normally incident plane wave would experience an instability. ;Optics (physics.optics)

We have implemented frequency stabilization of a QCL to an ultra-low expansion (ULE) reference cavity, via upconversion to the near-IR spectral range, at a level of $1\times10^{-13}$. The absolute frequency of the QCL is measured relative to a hydrogen maser, with instability $<1\times10^{-13}$ and inaccuracy $5\times10^{-13}$, using a frequency comb phase-stabilized to an independent ultrastable laser. The QCL linewidth is determined to be 60 Hz, dominated by fiber noise. Active suppression of fiber noise could result in sub-10 Hz linewidth. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Carminati;  We study theoretically the spatial correlations between the intensities measured at the input and output planes of a disordered scattering medium. We show that at large optical thicknesses, a long-range spatial correlation persists and takes negative values. For small optical thicknesses, short-range and long-range correlations coexist, with relative weights that depend on the optical thickness. These results may have direct implications for the control of wave transmission through complex media by wavefront shaping, thus finding applications in sensing, imaging and information transfer. ;Optics (physics.optics)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06361;Universal spin-momentum locking of evanescent waves; Todd Van Mechelen,  Zubin Jacob;  We show the existence of an inherent property of evanescent electromagnetic waves: spin-momentum locking, where the direction of momentum fundamentally locks the polarization of the wave. We trace the ultimate origin of this phenomenon to complex dispersion and causality requirements on evanescent waves. We demonstrate that every case of evanescent waves in total internal reflection, surface states and optical fibers/waveguides possesses this intrinsic spin-momentum locking. We also introduce a universal right-handed triplet consisting of momentum, decay and spin for evanescent waves. We derive the Stokes parameters for evanescent waves which reveal an intriguing result - every fast decaying evanescent wave is inherently circularly polarized with its handedness tied to the direction of propagation. We also show the existence of a fundamental angle associated with total internal reflection (TIR) such that propagating waves locally inherit perfect circular polarized characteristics from the evanescent wave. This circular TIR condition occurs if and only if the ratio of permittivities of the two dielectric media exceeds the golden ratio. Our work leads to a unified understanding of this spin-momentum locking in various nanophotonic experiments and sheds light on the electromagnetic analogy with the quantum spin hall state for electrons. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06412;Giant anomalous self-steepening in photonic crystal waveguides; Chad Husko,  Pierre Colman;"  Self-steepening of optical pulses arises due the dispersive contribution of the $\chi^{(3)}(\omega)$ Kerr nonlinearity. In typical structures this response is on the order of a few femtoseconds with a fixed frequency response. In contrast, the effective $\chi^{(3)}$ Kerr nonlinearity in photonic crystal waveguides (PhCWGs) is largely determined by the geometrical parameters of the structure and is consequently tunable over a wide range. Here we show self-steepening based on group-velocity (group-index) modulation for the first time, giving rise to a new physical mechanism for generating this effect. Further, we demonstrate that periodic media such as PhCWGS can exhibit self-steepening coefficients two orders of magnitude larger than typical systems. At these magnitudes the self-steepening strongly affects the nonlinear pulse dynamics even for picosecond pulses. Due to interaction with additional higher-order nonlinearities in the semiconductor materials under consideration, we employ a generalized nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger equation numerical model to describe the impact of self-steepening on the temporal and spectral properties of the optical pulses in practical systems, including new figures of merit. These results provide a theoretical description for recent experimental results presented in [Scientific Reports 3, 1100 (2013) and Phys. Rev. A 87, 041802 (2013)]. More generally, these observations apply to all periodic media due to the rapid group-velocity variation characteristic of these structures. ";Optics (physics.optics)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06419;Highly Nonlinear Luminescence Induced by Gold Nanoparticles on Glass  Surfaces with Continuous-Wave Laser Illumination; Yong Wu,  Xundong Wu,  Ligia Toro,  Enrico Stefani;  We report on highly nonlinear luminescence being observed from individual spherical gold nanoparticles immobilized on a glass surface and illuminated by continuous-wave (CW) lasers with relatively low power. The nonlinear luminescence shows optical super-resolution beyond the diffraction limit in three dimensions compared to the scatting of the excitation laser light. The luminescence intensity from most nanoparticles is proportional to the 5th--7th power of the excitation laser power and has wide excitation and emission spectra across the visible wavelength range. Strong nonlinear luminescence is only observed near the glass surface. High optical nonlinearity excited by low CW laser power is related to a long-lived dark state of the gold nanoparticles, where the excitation light is strongly absorbed. This phenomenon has potential biological applications in super-resolution and deep tissue imaging. ;Optics (physics.optics)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06437;Analytic derivation of electrostrictive tensors and their application to  optical force density calculations; Wujiong Sun,  S. B. Wang,  Jack Ng,  Lei Zhou,  C. T. Chan;  Using multiple scattering theory, we derived for the first time analytical formulas for electrostrictive tensors for two dimensional metamaterial systems. The electrostrictive tensor terms are found to depend explicitly on the symmetry of the underlying lattice of the metamaterial and they also depend explicitly on the direction of a local effective wave vector. These analytical results enable us to calculate light induced body forces inside a composite system (metamaterial) using the Helmholtz stress tensor within the effective medium formalism in the sense that the fields used in the stress tensor are those obtained by solving the macroscopic Maxwell equation with the microstructure of the metamaterial replaced by an effective medium. Our results point to some fundamental questions of using an effective medium theory to determine optical force density. In particular, the fact that Helmholtz tensor carries electrostrictive terms that are explicitly symmetry dependent means that the standard effective medium parameters cannot give sufficient information to determine body force density, even though they can give the correct total force. A more challenging issue is that the electrostrictive terms are related to a local effective wave vector, and it is not always obtainable in systems with boundary reflections within the context of a standard effective medium approach. ;Optics (physics.optics)

The robustness of this method comes from the redundancy of the dataset that in turn depends on the amount of oversampling and the form of the illumination. Although the role of oversampling in ptychography is fairly well understood, the same cannot be said of the illumination structure. This paper provides a vector space model of ptychography that accounts for the illumination structure in a way that highlights the role of the Wigner distribution function in iterative ptychography. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Birefringence can reduce the interferometric contrast and can produce dynamical disturbances in interferometers. In this work we use the method of polarisation-dependent resonance frequency analysis of Fabry-Perot-cavities containing silicon as a birefringent medium. Our measurements show a birefringence of silicon along the (111) axis of the order of $\Delta\, n \approx 10^{-7}$ at a laser wavelength of 1550nm and room temperature. A model is presented that explains the results of different settings of our measurements as a superposition of elastic strains caused by external stresses in the sample and plastic strains possibly generated during the production process. An application of our theory on the proposed ET test mass geometry suggests no critical effect on birefringence due to elastic strains. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Mosk;  We provide an introduction to complex photonic media, that is, composite materials with spatial inhomogeneities that are distributed over length scales comparable to or smaller than the wavelength of light. This blossoming field is firmly rooted in condensed matter physics, in optics, and in materials science. Many stimulating analogies exist with other wave phenomena such as sound and seismology, X-rays, neutrons. The field has a rich history, which has led to many applications in lighting, novel lasers, light harvesting, microscopy, and bio optics. We provide a brief overview of complex photonic media with different classes of spatial order, varying from completely random to long-periodically ordered structures, quasi crystalline and aperiodic structures, and arrays of cavities. In addition to shaping optical waves by suitable photonic nanostructures, the realization is quickly arising that the spatial shaping of optical wavefronts with spatial light modulators dramatically increases the number of control parameters. As a result, it is becoming possible for instance to literally see through completely opaque complex media. We discuss a unified view of complex photonic media by means of a photonic interaction strength parameter. This parameter gauges the interaction of light with any complex photonic medium, and allows to compare complex media from different classes for similar applications. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

We then numerically examine the characteristics of the metamaterial composed of coupled cut-wire pairs using a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. The FDTD simulation confirms that an EIT-like transparency phenomenon occurs in the metamaterial owing to indirect coupling. Finally, we compare the results of the theoretical and numerical analyses. The behavior of the EIT-like metamaterial is found to be well described by the mechanical model of the coupled resonators. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Existing commercial LiNibO3 Mach-Zehnder modulators have intrinsic drawbacks in linearity to provide high fidelity communication. In this paper, we present the design, fabrication and characterization of a traveling wave directional coupler modulator based on electro-optic polymer, which is able to provide high linearity, high speed, and low optical insertion loss.

Upon enforcing a weak spectral asymmetry in the properties of the qubits, the steady-state probability to obtain a maximally entangled, subradiant state approaches unity. This occurs despite the high losses associated to the plasmonic nanoantenna that are usually considered as being detrimental. The entanglement scheme is shown to be quite robust against variations in the transition frequencies of the quantum dots and deviations in their prescribed position with respect to the nanoantenna.

This solution, termed as a high-order quasi-Gaussian (qG) vortex beam, exactly satisfies the vector Helmholtz and Maxwell's equations. It is characterized by a nonzero integer degree and order (n,m), respectively, an arbitrary waist w0, a diffraction convergence length known as the Rayleigh range zR, and an azimuthal phase dependency in the form of a complex exponential corresponding to a vortex beam. An attractive feature of the high-order solution is the rigorous description of strongly focused (or strongly divergent) vortex wave-fields without the need of neither the higher-order corrections nor the numerically intensive methods. Closed-form expressions and computational results illustrate the analysis and some properties of the high-order qG vortex beams based on the axial and transverse polarization schemes of the vector potentials with emphasis on the beam waist. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Starting with a transfer-matrix representation of the electromagnetic field in a generic layered medium, we apply Fourier transformation and a series of mathematical manipulations to isolate a term explicitly dependent on Floquet-Bloch modes. Fourier-domain representation of the electromagnetic field can be reduced into a product of the Floquet-Bloch term and two other matrix factors: one governed by reflections from the medium boundaries and another dependent on layer composition. Electromagnetic fields in any finite, lossy, layered structure can now be interpreted in the Fourier-domain by separable factors dependent on distinct physical features of the structure. The developed theory enables new methods for analyzing and communicating the electromagnetic properties of layered metamaterials. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Saito;  An optical cavity consisting of optically trapped mirrors makes a resonant bar that can be stiffer than diamond. A limitation of the stiffness arises in the length of the optical bar as a consequence of the finite light speed. High laser power and light mass mirrors are essential for realization of a long and stiff optical bar that can be useful for example in the gravitational-wave detector aiming at the observation of a signal from neutron-star collisions, supernovae, etc. In this letter, we introduce a parametric signal amplification scheme that realizes the long and stiff optical bar without the need to increase the laser power. ;"Optics (physics.optics); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

Merle Elson;  We investigate the interaction of polarized electromagnetic waves with hyperbolic metamaterial structures, whereby the in-plane permittivity component $\epsilon_x$ is opposite in sign to the normal component $\epsilon_z$. We find that when the thickness of the metamaterial is smaller than the wavelength of the incident wave, hyperbolic metamaterials can absorb significantly higher amounts of electromagnetic energy compared to their conventional counterparts. We also demonstrate that for wavelengths leading to $\Re(\epsilon_z) \approx 0$, near-perfect absorption arises and persists over a range of frequencies and subwavelength structure thicknesses. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)"

Bender,  Joel R. Wendt,  Jon F. Ihlefeld,  Paul G. Clem,  Jeremy B. Wright,  Igal Brener;  The reflection of an optical wave from a metal, arising from strong interactions between the optical electric field and the free carriers of the metal, is accompanied by a phase reversal of the reflected electric field. A far less common route to achieve high reflectivity exploits strong interactions between the material and the optical magnetic field to produce a magnetic mirror which does not reverse the phase of the reflected electric field. At optical frequencies, the magnetic properties required for strong interaction can only be achieved through the use of artificially tailored materials. Here we experimentally demonstrate, for the first time, the magnetic mirror behavior of a low-loss, all-dielectric metasurface at infrared optical frequencies through direct measurements of the phase and amplitude of the reflected optical wave. The enhanced absorption and emission of transverse electric dipoles placed very close to magnetic mirrors can lead to exciting new advances in sensors, photodetectors, and light sources. ;Optics (physics.optics)

More recently, silicon has become the key material to achieve large-scale integration of photonic devices for optical interconnect and telecommunication. For optics, silicon has significant advantages: it offers a very high refractive index and is highly transparent in the spectral range from 1.2 to 8 micron. To fully exploit silicon's superior performance in a remarkably broad range and to enable new optoelectronic functionalities, here we describe a general method to integrate silicon photonic devices on arbitrary substrates. In particular, we apply the technique to successfully integrate silicon micro-ring resonators on mid-infrared compatible substrates for operation in the mid-infrared. These high-performance mid-infrared optical resonators are utilized to demonstrate, for the first time, on-chip cavity-enhanced mid-infrared spectroscopic analysis of organic chemicals with a limit of detection of less than 0.1 ng. ;Optics (physics.optics)

However, conventional optical single molecule spectroscopy techniques such as F\""orster fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) or fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) are limited by diffraction to the nanomolar concentration range, far below the physiological micromolar concentration range where most biological reaction occur. To breach the diffraction limit, zero mode waveguides and plasmonic antennas exploit the surface plasmon resonances to confine and enhance light down to the nanometre scale. The ability of plasmonics to achieve extreme light concentration unlocks an enormous potential to enhance fluorescence detection, FRET and FCS. Single molecule spectroscopy techniques greatly benefit from zero mode waveguides and plasmonic antennas to enter a new dimension of molecular concentration reaching physiological conditions. The application of nano-optics to biological problems with FRET and FCS is an emerging and exciting field, and is promising to reveal new insights on biological functions and dynamics.

Savel'eva;  The method of Doppler - free comb - spectroscopy for dipole transitions was proposed. The calculations for susceptibility spectrum for moving two-level atoms driving by strong counter propagating combs have been done. The used theoretical method based on the Fourier expansion of the components of density matrix on two rows on kv (v-velocity of group of atoms, k-projection of wave vector) and {\Omega} (frequency between comb components). For testing of validity of this method the direct numerical integration was done. The narrow peaks with homogeneous width arise on the background of Doppler counter. The contrast of these peaks is large for largest amplitudes of comb-components. Power broadening is increasing with increase of field amplitudes. The spectral range of absorption spectrum is determined by the spectral range of comb generator and all homogeneous lines arise simultaneously. The spectral resolution is determined by the width of homogeneously-broadening lines. The physical nature of narrow peaks is in the existence of multi-photon transitions between manifolds of quasi-energy levels arising for different groups of atoms moving with velocities that satisfy to the resonant conditions 2kv= (n+l){\Omega}, where n, l - are integers and {\Omega} - frequency difference between comb teeth. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph)"

However, their rotational symmetry and low radiation loss impede energy exchange between WGMs and the surrounding. As a result, free-space coupling of light into and from WGMRs is very challenging. In previous schemes, resonators are intentionally deformed to break circular symmetry to enable free-space coupling of carefully aligned focused light, which comes with bulky size and alignment issue that hinder the realization of compact WGMR applications. Here, we report a new class of nanocouplers based on cavity enhanced Rayleigh scattering from nano-scatterer(s) on resonator surface, and demonstrate whispering gallery microlaser by free-space optical pumping of an Ytterbium doped silica microtoroid via the scatterers. This new scheme will not only expand the range of applications enabled by WGMRs, but also provide a possible route to integrate them into solar powered green photonics. ;Optics (physics.optics)

The most well-known examples include the role of mirror symmetry breaking for the generation of even harmonics, and the selection rule related to the rotation symmetry in harmonic generation for fundamental beams with circular polarizations. While the role of mirror symmetry breaking in second harmonic generation has been extensively studied in plasmonic systems, the investigation on selection rules pertaining to circular polarization states of harmonic generation has been limited to crystals, i.e. symmetries at the atomic level. Here we demonstrate the rotational symmetry dependent third harmonic generation from nonlinear plasmonic metacrystals. We show that the selection rule can be imposed by the rotational symmetry of meta-crystals embedded into an isotropic organic nonlinear thin film. The results presented here may open new avenues for designing symmetry-dependent nonlinear optical responses with tailored plasmonic nanostructures. ;Optics (physics.optics)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.1609;Resonant state expansion applied to three-dimensional open optical  systems; M.B. Doost,  W. Langbein,  E.A. Muljarov;  The resonant state expansion (RSE), a rigorous perturbative method in electrodynamics, is developed for three-dimensional open optical systems. Results are presented using the analytically solvable homogeneous dielectric sphere as unperturbed system. Since any perturbation which breaks the spherical symmetry mixes transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) modes, the RSE is extended here to include TM modes and a zero-frequency pole of the Green's function. We demonstrate the validity of the RSE for TM modes by verifying its convergence towards the exact result for a homogeneous perturbation of the sphere. We then apply the RSE to calculate the modes for a selection of perturbations sequentially reducing the remaining symmetry, given by a change of the dielectric constant of half-sphere and quarter-sphere shape. Since no exact solutions are known for these perturbations, we verify the RSE results by comparing them with the results of state of the art finite element method (FEM) and finite difference in time domain (FDTD) solvers. We find that for the selected perturbations, the RSE provides a significantly higher accuracy than the FEM and FDTD for a given computational effort, demonstrating its potential to supersede presently used methods. We furthermore show that in contrast to presently used methods, the RSE is able to determine the perturbation of a selected group of modes by using a limited basis local to these modes, which can further reduce the computational effort by orders of magnitude. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Danilishin,  Slawek Gras;  Triply resonant three mode interactions in long optical cavities have been shown to lead to enhanced scattering of carrier light by the ultrasonic acoustic modes of the test mass mirrors. At high optical power, this can lead to parametric instability (parametric gain R > 1) for a few acoustic modes with strong spectral and spatial overlap. Numerous ?~10^3 acoustic modes of the test masses are predicted to have R > 10^2. Experimental studies have shown that such modes also strongly scatter the carrier light, enabling very sensitive readout of the acoustic modes. The 3-mode scattering from the thermal fluctuation of large population of ultrasonic modes would causes random changes in occupation number of the carrier light and cavity transverse optical modes. Because the thermal fluctuation time scale (set by the acoustic mode relaxation times) is typically a few seconds, the noise spectrum from thermally induced photon number fluctuations is strongly peaked at low frequency. The noise level depends on the acoustic mode structure and acoustic losses of the test masses, the transverse optical mode spectrum of the optical cavities and on the test mass temperature. We theoretically investigate the possible effect of this noise and show that in advanced detectors under construction three mode interaction noise is below the standard quantum limit, but could set limits on future low frequency detectors that aim to exceed the free mass standard quantum limit. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Sub-diffractive propagation along with dispersive broadening of the light bullets in free space after they exit the nonlinear medium indicate a strong space-time coupling within the bullet. This finding is confirmed by measurements of spatiotemporal energy density flux that exhibits the same features as stationary, polychromatic Bessel beam, thus highlighting the physical nature of the light bullets. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Despite the lack of a cavity structure, we achieve a coupling efficiency of the spontaneous emission to the waveguide mode of 0.07(0.01), in agreement with our calculations. In a further experiment, we also demonstrate the use of a plasmonic nanoparticle as a dispersive output coupler. Our laser architecture is promising for a number of applications in optofluidics and provides a fundamental model system for studying nonresonant feedback stimulated emission. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

The model system that we have chosen is the 'add-drop filter', which comprises an optical microcavity and two waveguide coupled to the cavity. Due to the evanescent field's scattering on the waveguide, the whispering gallery modes in the microcavity form doublets, which manifest themselves as splittings in the spectrum. As these doublets can be regarded as a spectral feature of dynamical tunneling between two different dynamical states with a spatial overlap, the effect of a Kerr nonlinearity on the doublets is numerically investigated in the more general context of the relationship between cubic nonlinearity and dynamical tunneling. Within the numerical realization of the model system, it is observed that the doublets shows a bistable transition in its transmission curve as the Kerr-nonlinearity in the cavity is increased. At the same time, one rotational mode gets dominant over the other one in the transmission, since the two states in the doublet have uneven linewidths. By using coupled mode theory, the underlying mode dynamics of the phenomena is theoretically modelled and clarified. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Thus after studying the force produced by a single particle, we address the effects of the spatial coherence on the bonding and anti-bonding states of two particles. The coherence length manifests the critical limitation of the contribution of evanescent modes to the scattered fields, and hence to the nature and strength of the electromagnetic fores, even when electric and/or magnetic partial wave resonances are excited. ;Optics (physics.optics)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.2699;Discrete-Gauss states and the generation of focussing dark beams; Albert Ferrando;"  Discrete-Gauss states are a new class of gaussian solutions of the free Schr\""odinger equation owning discrete rotational symmetry. They are obtained by acting with a discrete deformation operator onto Laguerre-Gauss modes. We present a general analytical construction of these states and show the necessary and sufficient condition for them to host embedded dark beams structures. We unveil the intimate connection between discrete rotational symmetry, orbital angular momentum, and the generation of focussing dark beams. The distinguishing features of focussing dark beams are discussed. The potential applications of Discrete-Gauss states in advanced optical trapping and quantum information processing are also briefly discussed.

However, the ideal characteristics of an optical frequency comb are application dependent. In this review, the different techniques for the generation and processing of high-repetition-rate (>10 GHz) optical frequency combs with technologies compatible with optical communication equipment are covered. Particular emphasis is put on the benefits and prospects of this technology in the general field of radio-frequency photonics, including applications in high-performance microwave photonic filtering, ultra-broadband coherent communications, and radio-frequency arbitrary waveform generation. ;Optics (physics.optics)

We show that the widely held view that the laser interferometer gravitational wave detector absorbs no energy from gravitational waves is only valid under the approximation of a frequency-independent optomechanical coupling strength and a pump laser without detuning with respect to the resonance of the interferometer. For a strongly detuned interferometer, the optical-damping dynamics dissipates gravitational wave energy through the interaction between the test masses and the optical field. For a non-detuned interferometer, the frequency-dependence of the optomechanical coupling strength causes a tiny energy dissipation, which is proved to be equivalent to the Doppler friction raised by Braginsky et.al. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Device scale arrays of quantum dots are formed by a two step regrowth process. We precisely locate the propagating region of a unidirectional photonic crystal waveguide with respect to the quantum dot nucleation site. Under pulsed optical excitation, the multiphoton emission probability from the exit of the waveguide is 12 \pm 5 % before any background correction.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.3316;Non-invasive real-time imaging through scattering layers and around  corners via speckle correlations; Ori Katz,  Pierre Heidmann,  Mathias Fink,  Sylvain Gigan;  Imaging with optical resolution through and inside complex samples is a difficult challenge with important applications in many fields. The fundamental problem is that inhomogeneous samples, such as biological tissues, randomly scatter and diffuse light, impeding conventional image formation. Despite many advancements, no current method enables to noninvasively image in real-time using diffused light. Here, we show that owing to the memory-effect for speckle correlations, a single image of the scattered light, captured with a standard high-resolution camera, encodes all the information that is required to image through the medium or around a corner. We experimentally demonstrate single-shot imaging through scattering media and around corners using incoherent light and various samples, from white paint to dynamic biological samples. Our lensless technique is simple, does not require laser sources, wavefront-shaping, nor time-gated detection, and is realized here using a camera-phone. It has the potential to enable imaging in currently inaccessible scenarios. ;Optics (physics.optics)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.3345;Space-time description of pulsed laser field by means of coherent states; Adam Bechler;"  Space-time description of pulsed laser radiation by means of coherent states is presented. The corresponding displacement operator contains space dependent annihilation and creation operators, not the ""standard"" operators corresponding to mode decomposition of the electromagnetic field. This allowed for a direct description of space and time dependence of the electromagnetic field of the pulse. The main characteristics of the pulse is its profile in the wave-vector space. It determines space-time structure of expectation values of the electromagnetic field carried by the pulse, and the distribution of photon modes as well. Determination of the latter required transition from the space-time, or field description to the photon mode approach. Expectation values of the electric field of a Gaussian pulse propagating in the z-direction and linearly polarized in the x-direction are presented graphically in the form of contour plots in the x-z plane. Apart of the dominant x-component electric field has a small longitudinal component in the z-direction. The dominant component of the magnetic field in the y-direction is acompannied by small components in z- and x-directions. The plane wave limit of the pulse can be implemented by shrinking transverse width of the profile to zero (transverse spatial extension goes to infinity), while keeping the photon density constant. One can then retrieve standard plane wave form of the pulse also in the dipole approximation. ";Optics (physics.optics)

These structures exhibit a resonant transmission enhancement that is used to design tunable bandpass filters. We provide a study of their spectral features and show by a modal analysis that the resonance peak is due to the excitation of leaky modes of the open photonic structure.

The accuracy of the measurement of the DOS determined from transmission eigenchannels is confirmed by the agreement with the DOS found from the decomposition of the field into modes. The distribution of the DOS, which underlies the Thouless number, is substantially broadened in the Anderson localization transition. We find a crossover from constant to exponential scaling of fluctuations of the DOS normalized by its average value. These results illuminate the relationships between scattering, stored energy and dynamics in complex media. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Disordered Systems and Neural Networks (cond-mat.dis-nn)"

We apply to a molecular sample a sequence of pairs of ultrashort excitation and probe pulses, with a linearly increasing time delay between the two pulses from one pair to the next. We measure, as a function of the delay, the intensity modulation in the signal resulting from the differential detection of the Stokes and anti-Stokes radiations generated at the sample. The Fourier transform of such time-domain signal reveals the spectrum of the excited vibrational Raman transitions. The experimental proof-of-principle demonstrates high resolution, broad spectral span and suppression of the non-resonant background, as well as sensitivity enhancement due to the differential detection. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)"

We propose that the destructive interference can be canceled out by tailoring the relative phase for the different spatial components.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.4219;Electrodynamic modeling of strong coupling between a metasurface and  intersubband transitions in quantum wells; Salvatore Campione,  Alexander Benz,  John F. Klem,  Michael B. Sinclair,  Igal Brener,  Filippo Capolino;  Strong light-matter coupling has recently been demonstrated in sub-wavelength volumes by coupling engineered optical transitions in semiconductor heterostructures (e.g., quantum wells) to metasurface resonances via near fields. It has also been shown that different resonator shapes may lead to different Rabi splittings, though this has not yet been well explained. In this paper, our aim is to understand the correlation between resonator shape and Rabi splitting, and in particular determine and quantify the physical parameters that affect strong coupling by developing an equivalent circuit network model whose elements describe energy and dissipation. Because of the subwavelength dimension of each metasurface element, we resort to the quasi-static (electrostatic) description of the near-field and hence define an equivalent capacitance associated to each dipolar element of a flat metasurface, and we show that this is also able to accurately model the phenomenology involved in strong coupling between the metasurface and the intersubband transitions in quantum wells. We show that the spectral properties and stored energy of a metasurface/quantum-well system obtained using our model are in good agreement with both full-wave simulation and experimental results. We then analyze metasurfaces made of three different resonator geometries and observe that the magnitude of the Rabi splitting increases with the resonator capacitance in agreement with our theory, providing a phenomenological explanation for the resonator shape dependence of the strong coupling process. ;Optics (physics.optics)

We improve upon this technique by using all fiber-optic coupled components and demonstrate operation at a new wavelength, 820 nm, with which we can achieve better than 1 $\mu$rad resolution. Mounting the system on a piezo-electric scanner allows us to acquire diffraction limited images with 1.5 $\mu$m spatial resolution.

Here we show that a high Q nanocavity can be created by placing a single III/V semiconductor nanowire with a diameter of under 100 nm in a grooved waveguide in a Si photonic crystal, by means of nanoprobe manipulation. We observe very fast spontaneous emission (91 ps) from nanowires accelerated by the strong Purcell enhancement in nanocavities, which proves that very strong light confinement can be achieved. Furthermore, this system enables us to move the nanocavity anywhere along the waveguide. This configuration provides a significant degree of flexibility in integrated photonics and permits the addition and displacement of various functionalities of III/V nanocavity devices in Si photonic circuits. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

We investigate the geometric and photoelastic optomechanical coupling resulting respectively from the deformation of the disk boundary and from the strain-induced refractive index changes in the material, for various mechanical modes of the disks. Photoelastic optomechanical coupling is shown to be a predominant coupling mechanism for certain disk dimensions and mechanical modes, leading to total coupling g$_{om}$ and g$_0$ reaching respectively 3 THz/nm and 4 MHz. Finally, we point towards ways to maximize the photoelastic coupling in GaAs disk resonators, and we provide some upper bounds for its value in various geometries. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Its exceptional properties, such as coherence and (sub)-femtosecond pulse durations, have led to a diversity of applications. Some of these require a high photon flux and megahertz repetition rates, e.g. to avoid space charge effects in photoelectron spectroscopy. To date this has only been achieved with enhancement cavities. Here, we establish a novel route towards powerful HHG sources. By achieving phase-matched HHG of a megahertz fibre laser we generate a broad plateau (25 eV - 40 eV) of strong harmonics, each containing more than $10^{12}$ photons/s, which constitutes an increase by more than one order of magnitude in that wavelength range. The strongest harmonic (H25, 30 eV) has an average power of 143 $\mu$W ($3\cdot10^{13}$ photons/s). This concept will greatly advance and facilitate applications in photoelectron or coincidence spectroscopy, coherent diffractive imaging or (multidimensional) surface science. ;Optics (physics.optics)

We harness this 'ultrafast' coherent feedback to optimize an optical field \emph{in time}, and show that when an optical oscillator based on a molecular gain medium is synchronously-pumped by ultrashort pulses, a temporally coherent multi mode field can develop that optimally dumps a general, dynamically-evolving vibrational wave-packet, into a \emph{single vibrational target state}. Measuring the emitted field opens a new window to visualization and control of fast molecular dynamics.

Through a stability analysis, we prove that the numerically obtained electromagnetic field evolution, interpreted as an explanation of the experiments, is nothing more than an extremely long transient, so long as to be hardly identifiable in an entirely numerical approach. Comparison with a model we have recently derived, which predicts a phase instability (Benjamin-Feir-like) compatible with the experimental observations, highlights the crucial ingredient for the dynamics. The wide spectrum of unstable eigenvalues accompanying the phase instability plays the role of an equivalent noise in a fully deterministic description, thus reconciling the heuristic models which could qualitatively reproduce the experimental observation either with deterministic equations in the presence of mode-coupling, or through stochastically driven modal decompositions. ;Optics (physics.optics)

We perform this error analysis for a variety of combined noise and background statistics, including a pseudo-Gaussian distribution that can be employed to treat approximately the photon-counting statistics of signal and background as well as purely Gaussian sensor read-out noise and more general, exponentially peaked distributions. We subsequently apply the MPE asymptotics to characterize the minimum conditions needed to localize a point source in three dimensions by means of a rotating-PSF imager and compare its performance with that of a conventional imager in the presence of background and sensor-noise fluctuations. In a separate paper, we apply the formalism to the related but qualitatively different problem of 2D super-resolution imaging of a closely spaced pair of point sources in the plane of best focus. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Applications (stat.AP)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.4919;Asymptotics of Bayesian Error Probability and 2D Pair Superresolution; Sudhakar Prasad;  This paper employs a recently developed asymptotic Bayesian multi-hypothesis testing (MHT) error analysis to treat the problem of superresolution imaging of a pair of closely spaced, equally bright point sources. The analysis exploits the notion of the minimum probability of error (MPE) in discriminating between two competing equi-probable hypotheses, a single point source of a certain brightness at the origin vs. a pair of point sources, each of half the brightness of the single source and located symmetrically about the origin, as the distance between the source pair is changed. For a Gaussian point-spread function (PSF), the analysis makes predictions on the scaling of the minimum source strength, expressed in units of photon number, required to disambiguate the pair as a function of their separation, in both the signal-dominated and background-dominated regimes. Certain logarithmic corrections to the quartic scaling of the minimum source strength with respect to the degree of superresolution characterize the signal-dominated regime, while the scaling is purely quadratic in the background-dominated regime. For the Gaussian PSF, general results for arbitrary strengths of the signal, background, and sensor noise levels are also presented. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Applications (stat.AP)"

Martín-Moreno;  One-dimensional light harvesting structures illuminated by a conventional lens are studied in this paper. Our theoretical study shows that high transmission efficiencies are obtained when the structure is placed near the focal plane of the lens. The considered structure is a finite slit-groove array (SGA) with a given number of grooves that are symmetrically distributed with respect to a central slit. The SGA is nano-patterned on an opaque metallic film. It is found that a total transmittance of 80% is achieved even for a single slit when (i) Fabry-Perot like modes are excited inside the slit and (ii) the effective cross section of the aperture becomes of the order of the full width at half maximum of the incident beam. A further enhancement of 8% is produced by the groove array. The optimal geometry for the groove array consists of a moderate number of grooves ($ \geq 4$) at either side of the slit, separated by a distance of half the incident wavelength $\lambda$. Grooves should be deeper (with depth $\geq \lambda/4$) than those typically reported for plane wave illumination in order to increase their individual scattering cross section. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)"

Tredicce;"  Kerr lens-mode-locked Ti:Sapphire lasers are known to display three coexistent modes of operation, that can be described as: continuous wave (CW), transform limited pulses (P1) and positive chirped pulses (P2). Optical rogue waves, in the form of pulses of high energy appearing much often than expected in a Gaussian distribution, are observed in the chaotic regime of the mode P2, but not of P1. These high energy pulses appear in an unpredictable way, but it is observed that their separation (if measured in number of round trips) can take only some definite values, which received the name of ""magic numbers"". The existence of optical rogue waves in P2 and not in P1, and also of the magic numbers, are correctly reproduced by a numerical simulation based on a five-variables iterative map. But, a successful numerical simulation provides limited insight on the physical causes of the observed phenomena. We present evidence that optical rogue waves in this laser follow a modulational instability, and that an initial condition in P1 rapidly evolves into P2 if the parameters' values are beyond that instability's threshold. The magic numbers are residuals of the periodic orbits of the ""cold"" cavity when it is perturbed by the opposite effects of a dissipative term, due to the presence of transversal apertures, and an expansive term, due to the Kerr effect.

If the frequency of the oscillations is high enough, a time-averaged specklegram is recorded from which the amplitude of the vibration can be estimated. The statistical character of speckle distributions along with the pixel sampling and intensity analog-to-digital conversion inherent to electronic cameras degrade the accuracy of the amplitude measurement to an extent that is analyzed and experimentally tested in this paper. The relations limiting the mutually competing metrological features of a defocused speckle system are also deduced mathematically. ;Optics (physics.optics)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.5436;Localized modes in dissipative lattice media: An overview; Yingji He,  Boris A. Malomed,  Dumitru Mihalache;  We overview recent theoretical studies of the dynamics of one- and two-dimensional spatial dissipative solitons in models based on the complex Ginzburg-Landau equations with the cubic-quintic combination of loss and gain terms, which include imaginary, real, or complex spatially periodic potentials. The imaginary potential represents periodic modulation of the local loss and gain. It is shown that the effective gradient force, induced by the inhomogeneous loss distribution, gives rise to three generic propagation scenarios for one-dimensional (1D) dissipative solitons: transverse drift, persistent swing motion, and damped oscillations. When the lattice-average loss/gain value is zero, and the real potential has spatial parity opposite to that of the imaginary component, the respective complex potential is a realization of the parity-time symmetry. Under the action of lattice potentials of the latter type, 1D solitons feature unique motion regimes in the form of transverse drift and persistent swing. In the 2D geometry, three types of axisymmetric radial lattices are considered, viz., ones based solely on the refractive-index modulation, or solely on the linear-loss modulation, or on a combination of both. The rotary motion of solitons in such axisymmetric potentials can be effectively controlled by varying the strength of the initial tangential kick. ;Optics (physics.optics)

In order to do so, the phase of the electron wave is corrected to resemble a spherical wave compensating for aberrations in the magnetic lenses. In this contribution we discuss the advantage of changing the phase of an electron wave in a specific way in order to obtain fundamentally different electron probes opening up new application in the (S)TEM. We focus on electron vortex states as a specific family of waves with an azimuthal phase signature and discuss their properties, production and applications. The concepts presented here are rather general and also different classes of probes can be obtained in a similar fashion showing that electron probes can be tuned to optimise a specific measurement or interaction. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)"

Clerici;  The nonlinear interaction between Near-Infrared (NIR) and Terahertz pulses is principally investigated as a means for the detection of radiation in the hardly accessible THz spectral region. Most studies have targeted second-order nonlinear processes, given their higher efficiencies, and only a limited number have addressed third-order nonlinear interactions, mainly investigating four-wave mixing in air for broadband THz detection. We have studied the nonlinear interaction between THz and NIR pulses in solid-state media (specifically diamond), and we show how the former can be frequency-shifted up to UV frequencies by the scattering from the nonlinear polarisation induced by the latter. Such UV emission differs from the well-known electric-field-induced second harmonic (EFISH) one, as it is generated via a phase-insensitive scattering, rather than a sum- or difference-frequency four-wave-mixing process. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Capuj,  Jordi Gomis-Bresco,  Francesc Alzina,  Alessandro Pitanti,  Amadeu Griol,  Alejandro Martinez,  Clivia M. Sotomayor Torres;  Optical forces can set tiny objects into states of coherent mechanical oscillation, also known as mechanical or phonon lasing. We present a novel pumping mechanism in an opto-mechanical photonic crystal that realizes mechanical lasing with relaxed requirements for the optical-mechanical modes and their inter-coupling. It derives from a spontaneously triggered thermal/free carrier self-pulsing and the anharmonic modulation of the radiation pressure force that comes as a consequence. Moreover, the feedback of the mechanics on the self-pulsing frequency-entrains both oscillators, creating a self-stabilized indecomposable system. A manifold of frequency-entrained regions with two different mechanical modes (at 54 and 122 MHz) are observed as a result of the wide tuneability of the natural frequency of the self-pulsing. The system operates at ambient conditions of pressure and temperature in a silicon compatible platform, which enables its exploitation in sensing, intra-chip metrology or time-keeping applications. ;Optics (physics.optics)

The MgO:PPLN-based OPO is synchronously pumped at 81.1 MHz by an Yb:fiber laser with double-peak spectrum.

Murdoch;  The nonlinear interaction of light in an optical fibre can mimic the physics at an event horizon. This analogue arises when a weak probe wave is unable to pass through an intense soliton, despite propagating at a different velocity. To date, these dynamics have been described in the time domain in terms of a soliton-induced refractive index barrier that modifies the velocity of the probe. Here, we complete the physical description of fibre-optic event horizons by presenting a full frequency-domain description in terms of cascaded four-wave mixing between discrete single-frequency fields, and experimentally demonstrate signature frequency shifts using continuous wave lasers. Our description is confirmed by the remarkable agreement with experiments performed in the continuum limit, reached using ultrafast lasers. We anticipate that clarifying the description of fibre event horizons will significantly impact on the description of horizon dynamics and soliton interactions in photonics and other systems. ;Optics (physics.optics)

The development of an efficient optical component that allows the simultaneous manipulation of the polarization and phase distribution is needed. Traditional methods require the combination of multiple optical devices, and a single optical device cannot easily realize full control of light. We theoretically predict and experimentally verify that our proposed dual-metasurfaces provide an excellent means to simultaneously manipulate the phase and polarization of transmission light at the nanoscale. By introducing a phase gradient along the interface, we achieved a near-perfect anomalous refraction with controllable polarization in the near-infrared region. On the basis of these properties, we created a dual-metasurface capable of generating radially polarized beam, demonstrating the power of full control of light. This work opens exciting avenues toward improving the degrees of freedom in the manipulation of light, including the propagation direction and distribution of the polarization and phase, and may profoundly affect a wide range of plasmonic applications. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Multiphoton lithography facilitated fabrication of the cuboid cavities directly on the substrate or on the decoupling structure, while similar structures were fabricated on the substrate by UV lithography for comparison. Significant reduction of the lasing threshold by a factor of ~30 has been observed for cavities supported by the photonic crystal relative to those fabricated on the substrate. The lasing mode spectra of the cuboid microresonators provide strong evidence showing that the lasing modes are localized in the horizontal plane, with the shape of an inscribed diamond. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Javier García de Abajo,  Romain Quidant;  The much sought after optical transistor --the photonic counterpart of the electronic transistor-- is poised to become a central ingredient in the development of optical signal processing. The motivation for using photons rather than electrons not only comes from their faster dynamics but also from their lower crosstalk and minor environmental decoherence, which enable a high degree of integration and the realization of quantum operations. A single-molecule transistor has been recently demonstrated at cryogenic temperatures. Here, we demonstrate that a single NV centre at room temperature can operate as an optical switch under non-resonant CW illumination. We show optical modulation of more than 80% and time response faster than 100 ns in the green-laser-driven fluorescence signal, which we control through an independent near-infrared (NIR) gating laser. Our study indicates that the NIR laser triggers a fast-decay channel of the NV mediated by promotion of the excited state to a dark band. This simple concept opens a new approach towards the implementation of nanoscale optical switching devices. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Under Laguerre-Gaussian mode illumination, a particle with a helical motion reflects light that acquires an additional frequency shift proportional to the angular velocity of rotation in the transverse plane, on top of the usual frequency shift due to the longitudinal motion. We determined both the translational and rotational velocities of the particles by switching between two modes: by illuminating with a Gaussian beam, we can isolate the longitudinal frequency shift; and by using a Laguerre-Gaussian mode, the frequency shift due to the rotation can be determined. Our technique can be used to characterize the motility of microorganisms with a full three-dimensional movement. ";Optics (physics.optics)

The complex dispersion relation (or complex Bloch band structure) of a metallic grating is rigorously calculated by the proposed algorithm with the finite-difference implementation. The abnormally large group velocity is observed at a plasmonic band edge with a large attenuation constant. Interestingly, we found the abnormal group velocity is caused by the leaky (radiation) loss not by metallic absorption (Ohmic) loss. The periodically modulated surface of the grating significantly modifies the original dispersion relation of the semi-infinite dielectric-metal structure and induces the extraordinarily large group velocity, which is different from the near-zero group velocity at photonic band edge. The work is fundamentally important to the design of plasmonic nanostructures. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)"

For any selected optical wavelength, a sharp Fano-resonance by the reflector is tunable to overlap spectrally with a wider dipole resonance by the sphere-chain director leading to the high directionality. The work provides design principles for directional and selective photonic NAs, which is particularly useful for photon detection and spontaneous emission manipulation. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)"

In this study, we show that the induced polarizations are circular, particularly at resonant wavelengths. We formulate optical near-field processes between nanostructures, accounting for their polarizations and geometries, and attribute circular polarization to the layout-dependent phase difference between the electrical susceptibilities associated with longitudinal and transverse-electric components. This study clarifies the fundamental optical properties of random nanostructured matter and offers generic theoretical concepts for implementing nanoscale polarizations of optical near-fields. ;Optics (physics.optics)

In the present work, it is shown that even much higher enhancement of EM fields is obtained by exciting the LSPs through extended surface plasmons (ESPs) generated at the metallic film surface using the Kretschmann-Raether configuration. We show that the largest EM field enhancement and the highest surface-enhanced fluorescence intensity are obtained when the incidence angle is the ESP resonance angle of the underlying metal film. The finite-difference time-domain simulations indicate that excitation of LSPs using ESPs can generate 1-3 orders higher EM field intensity than direct excitation of the LSPs using incidence from free space. The ultrahigh enhancement is attributed to the strong confinement of the ESP waves in the vertical direction. The drastically intensified EM fields are significant for highly-sensitive refractive index sensing, surface-enhanced spectroscopies, and enhancing the efficiency of optoelectronic devices. ;Optics (physics.optics)

These optoelectronic capabilities can augment complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) devices for high-speed and low-power optical interconnects. Here, we demonstrate an on-chip ultrafast photodetector based on a two-dimensional heterostructure consisting of high-quality graphene encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride. Coupled to the optical mode of a silicon waveguide, this 2D heterostructure-based photodetector exhibits a maximum responsivity of 0.36 A/W and high-speed operation with a 3 dB cut-off at 42 GHz. From photocurrent measurements as a function of the top-gate and source-drain voltages, we conclude that the photoresponse is consistent with hot electron mediated effects. At moderate peak powers above 50 mW, we observe a saturating photocurrent consistent with the mechanisms of electron-phonon supercollision cooling. This nonlinear photoresponse enables optical on-chip autocorrelation measurements with picosecond-scale timing resolution and exceptionally low peak powers. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)"

The expression directly relates the height correlation function to diffuse scattered intensity along a linear path at fixed polar angle. We test the solution by measuring the angular distribution of light scattered from rough silicon surfaces, and comparing extracted height correlation functions to those derived from atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results agree closely with AFM over a wider range of roughness parameters than previous formulations of the inverse scattering problem, while relying less on large-angle scatter data. Our expression thus provides an accurate analytical equation for the height correlation function of a wide range of surfaces based on measurements using a simple, fast experimental procedure. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Whereas in ABA-stacked TLG, we observe magnetophonon oscillations consistent with single-bilayer chiral band doublets, the features are flat for ABC-stacked TLG up to magnetic fields of 9 T. This suppression can be attributed to the enhancement of band chirality that compactifies the spectrum of Landau levels and modifies the magnetophonon resonance properties. The drastically different coupling behaviour between the electronic excitations and the E2g phonons in ABA- and ABC-stacked TLG reflects their different electronic band structures and the electronic Landau level transitions and thus can be another way to determine the stacking orders and to probe the stacking-order-dependent electronic structures. In addition, the sensitivity of the magneto-Raman scattering to the particular stacking order in few layers graphene highlights the important role of interlayer coupling in modifying the optical response properties in van der Waals layered materials. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)"

The proposed method greatly reduces computation times and therefore allows for the investigation of the dependence of timing fluctuations over greater parameter domains. We show that resonant feedback leads to a reduction in the timing jitter and that a frequency-pulling region forms about the main resonances, within which a timing jitter reduction is observed. The width of these frequency-pulling regions increases linearly with short feedback delay times. We derive an analytic expression for the timing jitter, which predicts a monotonous decrease in the timing jitter for resonant feedback of increasing delay lengths, when timing jitter effects are fully separated from amplitude jitter effects. For long feedback cavities the decrease in timing jitter scales approximately as $1/\tau$ with the increase of the feedback delay time $\tau$. ;Optics (physics.optics)

For appropriately chosen source pairs, we show that full waveform array measurements can be recovered from such intensity measurements by solving a linear least squares problem. The least squares solution can be used to image with Kirchhoff migration, even if the solution is determined only up to a known one-dimensional nullspace. The same imaging strategy can be used when the medium is probed with point sources driven by correlated Gaussian processes and autocorrelations are measured at a single location. Since autocorrelations are robust to noise, this can be used for imaging when the probing wave is drowned in background noise. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Numerical Analysis (math.NA)"

F. Jaeger,  Lukas Chrostowski,  Sudip Shekhar;  We demonstrate that n-doped resistive heaters in silicon waveguides show photoconductive effects with high responsivities. These photoconductive heaters, integrated into microring resonator (MRR)-based filters, were used to automatically tune and stabilize the filter's resonance wavelength to the input laser's wavelength. This is achieved without requiring dedicated defect implantations, additional material depositions, dedicated photodetectors, or optical power tap-outs. Automatic wavelength stabilization of first-order MRR and second-order series-coupled MRR filters is experimentally demonstrated. Open eye diagrams were obtained for data transmission at 12.5 Gb/s while the temperature was varied by 5 C at a rate of 0.28 C/s. We theoretically show that series-coupled MRR-based filters of any order can be automatically tuned by using photoconductive heaters to monitor the light intensity in each MRR, and sequentially aligning the resonance of each MRR to the laser's wavelength. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Here, we obtain new exact expressions for the dipolar moments of a localized electric current distribution. The typical integrals for the dipole moments of electromagnetically small sources are recovered as the lowest order terms of the new expressions in a series expansion with respect to the size of the source. All the higher order terms can be easily obtained. We also provide exact and approximated expressions for dipoles that radiate a definite polarization handedness (helicity). Formally, the new exact expressions are only marginally more complex than their lowest order approximations. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Classical Physics (physics.class-ph)"

The expressions of the incident radiation and the radiative flux field are angularly and spatially discretized with a double Gauss quadrature, and the temperature field is obtained by using an iterative process. Some numerical solutions are tabulated and graphically presented as the benchmark solutions. Temperature and two components of the radiative flux are finally sketched on the whole domain.

We analytically show how the split into electric and toroidal parts causes the appearance of non-radiative components in each of the two parts. These non-radiative components, which cancel each other when both parts are summed, preclude the separate determination of each part by means of measurements of the radiation from the source or of its coupling to external electromagnetic waves. In other words, there is no toroidal radiation or independent toroidal electromagnetic coupling. The formal meaning of the toroidal multipoles is clear in our derivations. They are the higher order terms of an expansion of the multipolar coefficients of electric parity with respect to the electromagnetic size of the source. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Classical Physics (physics.class-ph)"

Here, based on a coupled-mode theory analysis, we establish a complete phase diagram in which the optical properties of such systems are fully controlled by two simple parameters (i.e., the intrinsic and radiation losses), which are in turn dictated by the geometrical/material parameters of the underlying structures. Such a phase diagram can greatly facilitate the design of appropriate metasurfaces with tailored functionalities (e.g., perfect absorption, phase modulator, electric/magnetic reflector, etc.), demonstrated by our experiments and simulations in the Terahertz regime. In particular, our experiments show that, through appropriate structural/material tuning, the device can be switched across the functionality phase boundaries yielding dramatic changes in optical responses. Our discoveries lay a solid basis for realizing functional and tunable photonic devices with such structures. ;Optics (physics.optics)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.00953;Polarization Drift Channel Model for Coherent Fibre-Optic Systems; Cristian B. Czegledi,  Magnus Karlsson,  Erik Agrell,  Pontus Johannisson;  A theoretical framework is introduced to model the dynamical changes of the state of polarization during transmission in coherent fibre-optic systems. The model generalizes the one-dimensional phase noise random walk to higher dimensions, accounting for random polarization drifts, emulating a random walk on the Poincar\'e sphere, which has been successfully verified using experimental data. The model is described in the Jones, Stokes and real four-dimensional formalisms, and the mapping between them is derived. Such a model will be increasingly important in simulating and optimizing future systems, where polarization-multiplexed transmission and sophisticated digital signal processing will be natural parts. The proposed polarization drift model is the first of its kind as prior work either models polarization drift as a deterministic process or focuses on polarization-mode dispersion in systems where the state of polarization does not affect the receiver performance. We expect the model to be useful in a wide-range of photonics applications where stochastic polarization fluctuation is an issue. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Information Theory (cs.IT)"

Maslovski;  The ideal black body fully absorbs all incident rays, that is, all propagating waves created by arbitrary sources. The known idealized realization of a black body is the perfectly matched layer (PML), widely used in numerical electromagnetics. However, ideal black bodies and PMLs do not interact with evanescent fields existing near any finite-size source, and the energy stored in these fields cannot be harvested. Here we introduce the concept of the ideal conjugate matched layer (CML), which fully absorbs energy of both propagating and evanescent fields of sources acting as an ideal sink for electromagnetic energy. Conjugate matched absorbers have exciting application potentials, as resonant attractors of electromagnetic energy into the absorber volume. We derive the conditions on the constitutive parameters of media which can serve as CML materials, numerically study the performance of planar and cylindrical CML and discuss possible realizations of such materials as metal-dielectric composites. ;Optics (physics.optics)

Shainline,  Mark T. Wade,  Martin J. Stevens,  Shellee D. Dyer,  Xiaoge Zeng,  Fabio Pavanello,  Thomas Gerrits,  Sae Woo Nam,  Richard P. Mirin,  Miloš A. Popović;  Correlated photon pairs are a fundamental building block of quantum photonic systems. While pair sources have previously been integrated on silicon chips built using customized photonics manufacturing processes, these often take advantage of only a small fraction of the established techniques for microelectronics fabrication and have yet to be integrated in a process which also supports electronics. Here we report the first demonstration of quantum-correlated photon pair generation in a device fabricated in an unmodified advanced (sub-100nm) complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process, alongside millions of working transistors. The microring resonator photon pair source is formed in the transistor layer structure, with the resonator core formed by the silicon layer typically used for the transistor body. With ultra-low continuous-wave on-chip pump powers ranging from 5 $\mu$W to 400 $\mu$W, we demonstrate pair generation rates between 165 Hz and 332 kHz using >80% efficient WSi superconducting nanowire single photon detectors. Coincidences-to-accidentals ratios consistently exceeding 40 were measured with a maximum of 55. In the process of characterizing this source we also accurately predict pair generation rates from the results of classical four-wave mixing measurements. This proof-of-principle device demonstrates the potential of commercial CMOS microelectronics as an advanced quantum photonics platform with capability of large volume, pristine process control, and where state-of-the-art high-speed digital circuits could interact with quantum photonic circuits. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

For the case of free-fall absolute gravimeters with a Michelson-type interferometer tracking the position of a free falling body, one of the effects that needs to be taken into account is the speed of light perturbation due to the finite speed of propagation of light. This effect has been extensively discussed in the past, and there is at present a disagreement between different studies. In this work, we present the analysis of new data and confirm the result expected from the theoretical analysis applied nowadays in free-fall gravimeters. We also review the standard derivations of this effect (by using phase shift or Doppler effect arguments) and show their equivalence. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det)"

The device is a compact microscope composed of off the shelf components, such as a light emitting diode (LED) source, a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor, and a specific combination of optical lenses that allow, through an appropriate software, Fourier transform processing of the sample volume.

We achieve a sensitivity of 50 cells/ml, which can be further increased to 0.2 cells/ml by preconcentrating an initial sample volume of 500 ml with an adhoc fluidic system.

A laboratory-controlled experiment was conducted in which coordinate fluctuations of the laser beam were recorded at a sufficiently high sampling rate for a wide range of turbulent conditions. Horizontal and vertical displacements of the laser beam centroid were subsequently analyzed by implementing detrended fluctuation analysis. This is a very well-known and widely used methodology to unveil memory effects from time series. Results obtained from this experimental analysis allow us to confirm that both coordinates behave as highly persistent signals for strong turbulent intensities. This finding is relevant for a better comprehension and modeling of the turbulence effects in free-space optical communication systems and other applications related to propagation of optical signals in the atmosphere. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics (physics.ao-ph); Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability (physics.data-an)"

We show that by inducing simultaneously destructive quantum interference for the single-photon and two-photon excitations in the CQED system, it is possible to observe the direct three-photon excitation of the higher-order ladder states of the CQED system. We report an experiment with cold Rb atoms confined in an optical cavity and demonstrate such interference control of the multi-photon excitations of the CQED system. The observed nonlinear excitation of the CQED ladder states agrees with a theoretical analysis based on a fully quantized treatment of the CQED system, but disagrees with the semiclassical analysis of the CQED system. Thus it represents the first direct observation of the quantum nature of the multiatom CQED system and opens new ways to explore quantum nonlinearity and its applications in quantum optical systems in which multiple absorbers/emitters are coupled with photons in confined cavity structures. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

The artificial magnetic optical response of such nanoparticles originates from circular displacement currents excited inside those structures and strongly depends on geometry and dispersion of optical materials. Here a new approach for increasing magnetic response via resonant bianisotropy effect is proposed and analyzed. The key mechanism of enhancement is based on electric-magnetic interaction between two electrically and magnetically resonant nanoparticles of all-dielectric dimer nanoantenna. It was shown that proper geometrical arrangement of the dimer in respect to the incident illumination direction allows flexible control over all vectorial components of magnetic polarizability, tailoring the later in the dynamical range of 100 % and enhancement up to 36 % relative to performances of standalone spherical particles.

Whereas conventional polarizers based on natural crystals and multilayer thin films are commonplace, nanostructured polarizers offer compact integrability [6,7], thermal stability in high-power systems [4,8], and space-variant vector beam generation [9,10]. Here, we introduce a new class of reflectors and polarizers fashioned with dielectric nanowire grids that are mostly empty space. It is fundamentally extremely significant that the wideband spectral expressions presented can be generated in these minimal systems. We provide computed results predicting high reflection and attendant polarization extinction in multiple spectral regions.

These observations indicate the spatial multi-mode structure of the squeezed vacuum field.

A very small dielectric permittivity is a leading example of such unusual features, since it produces an exotic static-like regime where the electromagnetic field is spatially slowly-varying over a physically large region. The so-called epsilon-near-zero metamaterials thus offer an ideal platform where to manipulate the inner details of the ""stretched"" field. Here we theoretically prove that a standard nonlinearity is able to operate such a manipulation to the point that even a thin slab produces a dramatic nonlinear pulse transformation, if the dielectric permittivity is very small within the field bandwidth. The predicted non-resonant releasing of full nonlinear coupling produced by the epsilon-near-zero condition does not resort to any field enhancement mechanisms and opens novel routes to exploiting matter nonlinearity for steering the radiation by means of ultra-compact structures.

The optical spring is realized in a 7 cm Fabry-Perot cavity comprised of a suspended 0.4 g small end mirror and a heavy input coupler, illuminated by two optical fields. The frequency, damping and stability of the optical spring resonance can be tuned by adjusting the power and detuning of the two optical fields, allowing for a precise measurement of the absorption-induced photo-thermal feedback. The magnitude and frequency dependence of the observed photo-thermal effect are consistent with predicted corrections due to transverse thermal diffusion and coating structure. While the observed photo-thermal feed-back tends to destabilize the optical spring, we also propose a small coating modification that would change the sign of the effect, making a single-carrier stable optical spring possible. ;"Optics (physics.optics); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)"

Although initially studied in oceanography, rogue waves have now been seen in many other domains, with particular recent interest in optics. Although most studies in optics have focussed on how nonlinearity can drive rogue wave emergence, purely linear effects have also been shown to induce extreme wave amplitudes. In this paper, we report a detailed experimental study of linear rogue waves in an optical system, using a spatial light modulator to impose random phase structure on a coherent optical field. After free space propagation, different random intensity patterns are generated, including partially-developed speckle, a broadband caustic network, and an intermediate pattern with characteristics of both speckle and caustic structures. Intensity peaks satisfying statistical criteria for rogue waves are seen especially in the case of the caustic network, and are associated with broader spatial spectra. In addition, the electric field statistics of the intermediate pattern shows properties of an optical sea with near-Gaussian statistics in elevation amplitude, and trough-to-crest statistics that are near-Rayleigh distributed but with an extended tail where a number of rogue wave events are observed. ;Optics (physics.optics)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.03386;A closed-form solution to predict short-range surface plasmons in thin  films and its application to hole arrays; Maria Lorente-Crespo,  Carolina Mateo-Segura;  A theoretical study of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) in ultrathin lossy metal films is presented. The dispersion relation of such films is well known and can be solved numerically to obtain a combination of long-range (LR-) and short-range (SR-) eigenmodes. In this contribution, a simple solution for the SR-SPPs is derived. An approximation for the LR- eigenmodes can be found elsewhere. To validate the approximation, a two dimensional (2D) periodic array of small holes is studied subsequently. The spectral response of the array is obtained by full-wave simulations and the results compared with those calculated analytically, showing an excellent agreement for small holes. ;Optics (physics.optics)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.03484;Path length enhancement in disordered media for increased absorption; Rajeshkumar Mupparapu,  Kevin Vynck,  Tomas Svensson,  Matteo Burresi,  Diederik S. Wiersma;  We theoretically and numerically investigate the capability of disordered media to enhance the optical path length in dielectric slabs and augment their light absorption efficiency due to scattering. We first perform a series of Monte Carlo simulations of random walks to determine the path length distribution in weakly to strongly (single to multiple) scattering, non-absorbing dielectric slabs under normally incident light and derive analytical expressions for the path length enhancement in these two limits. Quite interestingly, while multiple scattering is expected to produce long optical paths, we find that media containing a vanishingly small amount of scatterers can still provide high path length enhancements due to the very long trajectories sustained by total internal reflection at the slab interfaces. The path length distributions are then used to calculate the light absorption efficiency of media with varying absorption coefficients. We find that maximum absorption enhancement is obtained at an optimal scattering strength, in-between the single-scattering and the diffusive (strong multiple-scattering) regimes. This study can guide experimentalists towards more efficient and potentially low-cost solutions in photovoltaic technologies. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Disordered Systems and Neural Networks (cond-mat.dis-nn)"

Kivelson;  We show that, measured in a backscattering geometry, the polar Kerr effect is absent if the nonlocal electromagnetic response function respects Onsager symmetry, characteristic of thermodynamic states that preserve time-reversal symmetry. A key element is an expression for the reflectivity tensor in terms of the retarded Green's function. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.03806;Fast Simulation of Gaussian-Mode Scattering for Precision Interferometry; Daniel Brown,  Rory Smith,  Andreas Freise;  Understanding how laser light scatters from realistic mirror surfaces is crucial for the design, com- missioning and operation of precision interferometers, such as the current and next generation of gravitational-wave detectors. Numerical simulations are indispensable tools for this task but their utility can in practice be limited by the computational cost of describing the scattering process. In this paper we present an efficient method to significantly reduce the computational cost of optical simulations that incorporate scattering. This is accomplished by constructing a near optimal representation of the complex, multi-parameter 2D overlap integrals that describe the scattering process (referred to as a reduced order quadrature). We demonstrate our technique by simulating a near-unstable Fabry-Perot cavity and its control signals using similar optics to those installed in one of the LIGO gravitational-wave detectors. We show that using reduced order quadrature reduces the computational time of the numerical simulation from days to minutes (a speed-up of $\approx 2750 \times$) whilst incurring negligible errors. This significantly increases the feasibility of modelling interferometers with realistic imperfections to overcome current limits in state-of-the-art optical systems. Whilst we focus on the Hermite-Gaussian basis for describing the scattering of the optical fields, our method is generic and could be applied with any suitable basis. An implementation of this reduced order quadrature method is provided in the open source interferometer simulation software Finesse. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.03810;Back-reflecting interferometeric sensor based on grating coupler on a  planar waveguide; Anat Demeter,  Shlomo Ruschin;  We present a one-port sensor based on a single diffraction grating delineated over a planar optical waveguide. Distinctly to previously reported devices, the grating here is used not only as I/O coupler, but also provides a built-in reference beam which is basically unaffected by the sensing process as manifested in changes of the effective refractive index of the waveguide. The sensing process causes two effects simultaneously: a change in the angle of the out-coupled beam and a change in the phase accumulated by that beam. Both changes can be determined by their conjunction with the reference beam back-diffracted directly by the grating. These two effects are expected to have despair sensitivities, the angle changing effect being coarse and the interferometric phase-change effect being highly sensitive. Sensing simultaneously at two different scales will translate into a large sensing dynamic range. ;Optics (physics.optics)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.03950;Graphene fish-scale array as controllable reflecting photonic structure; Victor Dmitriev,  Clerison Nascimento,  Sergey L. Prosvirnin;  We report resonant features of novel controllable reflectarray which consists of meander-like graphene strips placed on a metal-backed dielectric substrate. The structure manifests two kinds of resonances appeared as sharp deeps of reflectivity. The first one exists because the strips of periodic cells of the structure have resonant sizes for induced surface plasmon-polaritons. The second kind of resonances is defined by excitation of TM eigenwaves of the whole structure as a plane photonic crystal. The latter resonances do not depend on whether the strips of the unit cells have resonant sizes or not. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.04037;Comparative analysis of imaging configurations and objectives for  Fourier microscopy; Jonathan A. Kurvits,  Mingming Jiang,  Rashid Zia;  Fourier microscopy is becoming an increasingly important tool for the analysis of optical nanostructures and quantum emitters. However, achieving quantitative Fourier space measurements requires a thorough understanding of the impact of aberrations introduced by optical microscopes, which have been optimized for conventional real-space imaging. Here, we present a detailed framework for analyzing the performance of microscope objectives for several common Fourier imaging configurations. To this end, we model objectives from Nikon, Olympus, and Zeiss using parameters that were inferred from patent literature and confirmed, where possible, by physical disassembly. We then examine the aberrations most relevant to Fourier microscopy, including the alignment tolerances of apodization factors for different objective classes, the effect of magnification on the modulation transfer function, and vignetting-induced reductions of the effective numerical aperture for wide-field measurements. Based on this analysis, we identify an optimal objective class and imaging configuration for Fourier microscopy. In addition, as a resource for future studies, the Zemax files for the objectives and setups used in this analysis have been made publicly available. ;Optics (physics.optics)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.04044;Optical Trapping and Control of a Dielectric Nanowire by a Nanoaperture; Mehdi Shafiei Aporvari,  Fardin Kheirandish,  Giovanni Volpe;  We demonstrate that a single sub-wavelength nanoaperture in a metallic thin film can be used to achieve dynamic optical trapping and control of a single dielectric nanowire. A nanoaperture can trap a nanowire, control its orientation when illuminated by a linearly-polarized incident field, and also rotate the nanowire when illuminated by a circularly-polarized incident field. Compared to other designs, this approach has the advantages of a low-power driving field entailing low heating and photodamage. ;Optics (physics.optics)

We present here some of our works on spin photonics and spin-photonic devices with metasurfaces. We develop a hybrid-order Poincare sphere to describe the evolution of spin states of wave propagation in the metasurface. Both the Berry curvature and the Pancharatnam-Berry phase on the hybrid-order Poincare sphere are demonstrated to be proportional to the variation of total angular momentum. Based on the spin-dependent property of Pancharatnam-Berry phase, we find that the photonic spin Hall effect can be observed when breaking the rotational symmetry of metasurfaces. Moreover, we show that the dielectric metasurfaces can provide great flexibility in the design of novel spin-photonic devices such as spin filter and spin-dependent beam splitter. ;Optics (physics.optics)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.04079;Theory of Pulsed Four-Wave-Mixing in One-dimensional Silicon Photonic  Crystal Slab Waveguides; Spyros Lavdas,  Nicolae C. Panoiu;  We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis and computational study of four-wave mixing (FWM) of optical pulses co-propagating in one-dimensional silicon photonic crystal waveguides (Si-PhCWGs). Our theoretical analysis describes a very general set-up of the interacting optical pulses, namely we consider nondegenerate FWM in a configuration in which at each frequency there exists a superposition of guiding modes. We incorporate in our theoretical model all relevant linear optical effects, including waveguide loss, free-carrier (FC) dispersion and FC absorption, nonlinear optical effects such as self- and cross-phase modulation (SPM, XPM), two-photon absorption (TPA), and cross-absorption modulation (XAM), as well as the coupled dynamics of FCs and optical field. In particular, our theoretical analysis based on the coupled-mode theory provides rigorously derived formulae for linear dispersion coefficients of the guiding modes, linear coupling coefficients between these modes, as well as the nonlinear waveguide coefficients describing SPM, XPM, TPA, XAM, and FWM. In addition, our theoretical analysis and numerical simulations reveal key differences between the characteristics of FWM in the slow- and fast-light regimes, which could potentially have important implications to the design of ultra-compact active photonic devices. ;Optics (physics.optics)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.04095;Generalized Fibonacci zone plates; Jie Ke,  Junyong Zhang,  Jianqiang Zhu;  We propose a family of zone plates which are produced by the generalized Fibonacci sequences and their axial focusing properties are analyzed in detail. Compared with traditional Fresnel zone plates, the generalized Fibonacci zone plates present two axial foci with equal intensity. Besides, we propose an approach to adjust the axial locations of the two foci by means of different optical path difference, and further give the deterministic ratio of the two focal distances which attributes to their own generalized Fibonacci sequences. The generalized Fibonacci zone plates may allow for new applications in micro and nanophotonics. ;"Optics (physics.optics); Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph)"
