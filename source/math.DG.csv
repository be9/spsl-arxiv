https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00358;Lorentzian manifolds with a conformal action of SL(2,R); Vincent Pecastaing;  We consider conformal actions of simple Lie groups on compact Lorentzian manifolds. Mainly motivated by the Lorentzian version of a conjecture of Lichnerowicz, we establish the alternative: Either the group acts isometrically for some metric in the conformal class, or the manifold is conformally flat - that is, everywhere locally conformally diffeomorphic to Minkowski space-time. When the group is non-compact and not locally isomorphic to SO(1,n), n>1, we derive global conclusions, extending a theorem of Frances and Zeghib to some simple Lie groups of real-rank 1. This result is also a first step towards a classification of the conformal groups of compact Lorentz manifolds, analogous to a classification of their isometry groups due to Adams, Stuck and, independently, Zeghib at the end of the 1990's. ;"Differential Geometry (math.DG); Dynamical Systems (math.DS)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00366;Rigidity of Free Boundary Surfaces in Compact 3-Manifolds with Strictly  Convex Boundary; Abraão Mendes;  In this paper we obtain an analogue of Toponogov theorem in dimension 3 for compact manifolds $M^3$ with nonnegative Ricci curvature and strictly convex boundary $\partial M$. Here we obtain a sharp upper bound for the length $L(\partial\Sigma)$ of the boundary $\partial\Sigma$ of a free boundary minimal surface $\Sigma^2$ in $M^3$ in terms of the genus of $\Sigma$ and the number of connected components of $\partial\Sigma$, assuming $\Sigma$ has index one. After, under a natural hypothesis on the geometry of $M$ along $\partial M$, we prove that if $L(\partial\Sigma)$ saturates the respective upper bound, then $M^3$ is isometric to the Euclidean 3-ball and $\Sigma^2$ is isometric to the Euclidean disk. In particular, we get a sharp upper bound for the area of $\Sigma$, when $M^3$ is a strictly convex body in $\mathbb R^3$, which is saturated only on the Euclidean 3-balls (by the Euclidean disks). We also consider similar results for stationary stable surfaces. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00395;Anisotropically Weighted and Nonholonomically Constrained Evolutions on  Manifolds; Stefan Sommer;  We present evolution equations for a family of paths that results from anisotropically weighting curve energies in non-linear statistics of manifold valued data. This situation arises when performing inference on data that have non-trivial covariance and are anisotropic distributed. The family can be interpreted as most probable paths for a driving semi-martingale that through stochastic development is mapped to the manifold. We discuss how the paths are projections of geodesics for a sub-Riemannian metric on the frame bundle of the manifold, and how the curvature of the underlying connection appears in the sub-Riemannian Hamilton-Jacobi equations. Evolution equations for both metric and cometric formulations of the sub-Riemannian metric are derived. We furthermore show how rank-deficient metrics can be mixed with an underlying Riemannian metric, and we relate the paths to geodesics and polynomials in Riemannian geometry. Examples from the family of paths are visualized on embedded surfaces, and we explore computational representations on finite dimensional landmark manifolds with geometry induced from right-invariant metrics on diffeomorphism groups. ;"Differential Geometry (math.DG); Statistics Theory (math.ST)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00488;Singularities of Frontals; Goo Ishikawa;  In this survey article we introduce the notion of frontals, which provides a class of generalised submanifolds with singularities but with well-defined tangent spaces. We present a review of basic theory and known studies on frontals in several geometric problems from singularity theory viewpoints. In particular, in this paper, we try to give some of detailed proofs and related ideas, which were omitted in the original papers, to the basic and important results related to frontals. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00570;Surfaces expanding by non-concave curvature functions; Haizhong Li,  Xianfeng Wang,  Yong Wei;  In this paper, we first investigate the flow of convex surfaces in Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^3$ and hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^3$ expanding by $F^{-\alpha}$, where $F$ is a monotone, homogeneous of degree one function of the principal curvatures of the surfaces and $\alpha\in(0,1]$. By deriving the key ingredient that the pinching ratio of the flow surface $M_t$ is no greater than that of the initial surface $M_0$, we prove the long time existence and the convergence of the flow. No concavity assumption of $F$ is required. We also show that for the flow in $\mathbb{H}^3$ with $\alpha\in (0,1)$, the limit shape may not be necessarily round after rescaling, by adapting Hung-Wang's approach in the case $\alpha=1$. ;"Differential Geometry (math.DG); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)"

We give generalized differential equations relating to mean curvatures of a totally umbilical half-lightlike submanifold admitting a totally umbilical screen distribution, and show that they are generalizations of those given by [4]. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00897;On the Calabi-Yau equation in the Kodaira-Thurston manifold; Luigi Vezzoni;  We review some previous results about the Calabi-Yau equation on the Kodaira-Thurston manifold equipped with an invariant almost-Kaehler structure and assuming the volume form invariant by the action of a torus. In particular, we observe that under some restrictions the problem is reduced to a Monge-Amp\`ere equation by using the ansatz $\tilde \omega=\Omega-dJdu+da$, where $u$ is a $T^2$-invariant function and $a$ is a $1$-form depending on $u$. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to non-invariant almost-complex structures by considering some basic cases and we finally take into account a generalization to higher dimensions. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01008;An integral formula for affine connections; Junfang Li,  Chao Xia;  In this article, we introduce a $2$-parameter family of affine connections and derive the Ricci curvature. We first establish an integral Bochner technique. On one hand, this technique yields a new proof to our recent work in \cite{LX} for substatic manifolds. On the other hand, this technique leads to various geometric inequalities and eigenvalue estimates under a much more general Ricci curvature conditions. The new Ricci curvature condition interpolates between static Ricci tensor and $1$-Bakry-Emery Ricci, and also includes the conformal Ricci as an intermediate case. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01169;Explicit Solving of the System of Natural PDE's of Minimal Surfaces in  the Four-Dimensional Euclidean Space; Georgi Ganchev,  Krasimir Kanchev;  The fact that minimal surfaces in the four-dimensional Euclidean space admit natural parameters implies that any minimal surface is determined uniquely up to a motion by two curvature functions, satisfying a system of two PDE's (the system of natural PDE's). In fact this solves the problem of Lund-Regge for minimal surfaces. Using the corresponding result for minimal surfaces in the three-dimensional Euclidean space, we solve explicitly the system of natural PDE's, expressing any solution by virtue of two holomorphic functions in the Gauss plane. We find the relation between two pairs of holomorphic functions (i.e. the class of pairs of holomorphic functions) generating one and the same solution of the system of natural PDE's. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)

Further, we give a functional determinant formula for the Ricci potential of the universal moduli space. ";Differential Geometry (math.DG)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01377;"A remark on our paper ""Negative Holomorphic curvature and positive  canonical bundle"""; Damin Wu,  Shing-Tung Yau;  This is a continuation of our first paper in [WY16]. There are two purposes of this paper: One is to give a proof of the main result in [WY16] without going through the argument depending on numerical effectiveness. The other one is to provide a proof of our conjecture, mentioned in [TY], where the assumption of negative holomorphic sectional curvature is dropped to quasi-negative. We should note that a solution to our conjecture is also provided by Diverio-Trapani [DT]. Both proofs depend on our argument in [WY16]. But our argument here makes use of the argument given by the second author and Cheng in [CY75]. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01395;A Hitchin Connection for a large class of families of Kähler  Structures; Jørgen Ellegaard Andersen,  Kenneth Rasmussen;  In this paper we construct a Hitchin connection in a setting, which significantly generalizes the setting covered by the first author previously, which in turn was a generalisation of the moduli space case covered by Hitchin in his original work on the Hitchin connection. In fact, our construction provides a Hitchin connection, which is a partial connection on the space of all compatible complex structures on an arbitrary, but fixed prequantizable symplectic manifold, which satisfies a certain Fano type condition. The subspace of the tangent space to the space of compatible complex structures on which the constructed Hitchin connection is defined, is in fact of finite co-dimension, if the symplectic manifold is compact. In a number of examples, including flat symplectic space, symplectic tori and moduli spaces of flat connections for a compact Lie group, we prove that our Hitchin connection is defined in a neighbourhood of the natural families of complex structures compatible with the given symplectic form, which these spaces admits. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)

An application of the Cartan-K\""ahler theory shows that some three-manifold can be presented in this way. We also classify all the homogeneous ones in $\mathbb{RP}^7$.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01579;Rigidity of Marginally Outer Trapped (Hyper)Surfaces with Negative  $σ$-Constant; Abraão Mendes;  In this paper we generalize the main result of [13] in two different situations: in the first case for MOTSs of genus greater than one and, in the second case, for MOTSs of high dimension with negative $\sigma$-constant. In both cases we obtain a splitting result for the ambient manifold when it contains a stable closed MOTS which saturates a lower bound for the area (in dimension 2) or for the volume (in dimension $\ge3$). These results are extensions of [21, Theorem 3] and [20, Theorem 3] to general (non-time-symmetric) initial data sets. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01606;Canonical Weierstrass representations for minimal surfaces in Euclidean  4-space; Georgi Ganchev,  Krasimir Kanchev;  Minimal surfaces of general type in Euclidean 4-space are characterized with the conditions that the ellipse of curvature at any point is centered at this point and has two different principal axes. Any minimal surface of general type locally admits geometrically determined parameters - canonical parameters. In such parameters the Gauss curvature and the normal curvature satisfy a system of two natural partial differential equations and determine the surface up to a motion. For any minimal surface parameterized by canonical parameters we obtain Weierstrass representations - canonical Weierstrass representations. These Weierstrass formulas allow us to solve explicitly the system of natural partial differential equations and to establish geometric correspondence between minimal surfaces of general type, the solutions to the system of natural equations and pairs of holomorphic functions in the Gauss plane. On the base of these correspondences we obtain that any minimal surface of general type in Euclidean 4-space determines locally a pair of two minimal surfaces in Euclidean 3-space and vice versa. Finally some applications of this phenomenon are given. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)

The first one is the corresponding problem with fixed boundary condition; and the second is associated with the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map for Jacobi fields. As an application, we show that the Morse index of a free boundary minimal annulus is equal to 4 if and only if it is the critical catenoid. ";Differential Geometry (math.DG)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01724;Quantum confinement on non-complete Riemannian manifolds; Dario Prandi,  Luca Rizzi,  Marcello Seri;"  We consider the quantum completeness problem, i.e. the problem of confining quantum particles, on a non-complete Riemannian manifold $M$ equipped with a smooth measure $\omega$, possibly degenerate or singular near the metric boundary of $M$, and in presence of a real-valued potential $V\in L^2_{\mathrm{loc}}(M)$. The main merit of this paper is the identification of an intrinsic quantity, the effective potential $V_{\mathrm{eff}}$, which allows to formulate simple criteria for quantum confinement. Let $\delta$ be the distance from the possibly non-compact metric boundary of $M$. A simplified version of the main result guarantees quantum completeness if $V\ge -c\delta^2$ far from the metric boundary and \[ V_{\mathrm{eff}}+V\ge \frac3{4\delta^2}-\frac{\kappa}{\delta}, \qquad \text{close to the metric boundary}. \] These criteria allow us to: (i) obtain quantum confinement results for measures with degeneracies or singularities near the metric boundary of $M$; (ii) generalize the Kalf-Walter-Schmincke-Simon Theorem for strongly singular potentials to the Riemannian setting for any dimension of the singularity; (iii) give the first, to our knowledge, curvature-based criteria for self-adjointness of the Laplace-Beltrami operator; (iv) prove, under mild regularity assumptions, that the Laplace-Beltrami operator in almost-Riemannian geometry is essentially self-adjoint, partially settling a conjecture formulated in [Boscain, Laurent - Ann.

As an application, we show that when $n=2$, the Calabi flow starting from a weak K\""ahler metric will become smooth immediately. It implies that in our settings, the weak minimizer of the Mabuchi energy is a smooth one. ";"Differential Geometry (math.DG); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01974;Real hyperbolic hyperplane complements in the complex hyperbolic plane; Barry Minemyer;"  This paper studies Riemannian manifolds of the form $M \setminus S$, where $M^4$ is a complete four dimensional Riemannian manifold with finite volume whose metric is modeled on the complex hyperbolic plane $\mathbb{C} \mathbb{H}^2$, and $S$ is a compact totally geodesic codimension two submanifold whose induced Riemannian metric is modeled on the real hyperbolic plane $\mathbb{H}^2$. In this paper we write the metric on $\mathbb{C} \mathbb{H}^2$ in polar coordinates about $S$, compute formulas for the components of the curvature tensor in terms of arbitrary warping functions (Theorem 7.1), and prove that there exist warping functions that yield a complete finite volume Riemannian metric on $M \setminus S$ whose sectional curvature is bounded above by a negative constant (Theorem 1.1(1)). The cases of $M \setminus S$ modeled on $\mathbb{H}^n \setminus \mathbb{H}^{n-2}$ and $\mathbb{C} \mathbb{H}^n \setminus \mathbb{C} \mathbb{H}^{n-1}$ were studied by Belegradek in [Bel12] and [Bel11], respectively.

In addition we study, among other examples, whether spaces having a generalized lower Ricci curvature bound fulfill these requirements. The conditions are satisfied by RCD*-spaces and, under extra assumptions, by CD-spaces, CD*-spaces, and MCP-spaces. However, we show that the MCP-condition by itself is not enough to guarantee a smooth behavior of these automorphism groups. More generally we show that spaces with good optimal transport properties meet as well the hypotheses. ;"Differential Geometry (math.DG); Metric Geometry (math.MG)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02099;The Gauss map on translational Riemannian manifolds and the topology of  hypersurfaces; Eduardo R. Longa,  Jaime B. Ripoll;  We introduce the notion of translational Riemannian manifolds and define a Gauss map for orientable immersed hypersurfaces lying in these ambients, an associated translational curvature and prove a Gauss-Bonnet theorem. We also use this Gauss map to prove that if $M^{n}$ is a compact, connected and oriented immersed hypersurface of the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^{n+1}$ ($n\geq2$) contained in a geodesic ball of radius $R$ and whose principal curvatures are strictly bigger than $\tan\left( R/2 \right)$, then $M$ is diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{S}^{n}$. Additionally, we show that for any $\varepsilon\in(0,\sqrt{2}-1)$ there exists a compact, connected and oriented immersed hypersurface $M_{\varepsilon}$ of $\mathbb{S}^{n+1}$ whose principal curvatures are strictly bigger than $\varepsilon \tan \left( R/2 \right)$ but $M_{\varepsilon}$ is not homeomorphic to a sphere. Finally, using this previous result, we reobtain a theorem of Qiaoling Wang and Changyu Xia (see [4]) which asserts that if a compact and oriented hypersurface of $\mathbb{S}^{n+1}$ is contained in an open hemisphere and has nowhere zero Gauss-Kronecker curvature, then it is diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{S}^n$. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02371;Conformal Walker metrics and linear Fefferman-Graham equations; Ian M Anderson,  Thomas Leistner,  Andree Lischewski,  Pawel Nurowski;  The conformal Fefferman-Graham ambient metric construction is one of the most fundamental constructions in conformal geometry. It embeds a manifold with a conformal structure into a pseudo-Riemannian manifold whose Ricci tensor vanishes up to a certain order along the original manifold. Despite the general existence result of such ambient metrics by Fefferman and Graham, not many examples of conformal structures with Ricci-flat ambient metrics are known. Motivated by previous examples, for which the Fefferman-Graham equations for the ambient metric to be Ricci-flat reduce to a system of linear PDEs, in the present article we develop a method to find ambient metrics for conformal classes of metrics with two-step nilpotent Schouten tensor. Using this method, for metrics for which the image of the Schouten tensor is invariant under parallel transport, i.e., certain types of Walker metrics, we obtain explicit ambient metrics. This includes certain left-invariant Walker metrics as well as pp-waves. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)

In the $\mathbb C$-analytic category this set consists of the Martinet hypersurface $\Sigma _2$, the restriction of the singular symplectic form $\omega$ to $T\Sigma_2$ and the kernel of $\omega^{n-1}$ at the point $p\in \Sigma_2$. In the $\mathbb R$-analytic and smooth categories this set contains one more invariant: the canonical orientation of $\Sigma_2$. We find the conditions to determine the kernel of $\omega^{n-1}$ at $p$ by the other invariants. In dimension $4$ we find sufficient conditions to determine the equivalence class of a singular symplectic form-germ with the structurally smooth Martinet hypersurface by the Martinet hypersurface and the restriction of the singular symplectic form to it. We also study the singular symplectic forms with singular Martinet hypersurfaces. We prove that the equivalence class of such singular symplectic form-germ is determined by the Martinet hypersurface, the canonical orientation of its regular part and the restriction of the singular symplectic form to its regular part if the Martinet hypersurface is a quasi-homogeneous hypersurface with an isolated singularity. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)

We show that the volume of a convex domain $D\subset H_1$ is equal to the integral of length of chord over all horizontal lines intersecting $D$. As the classical result in integral geometry, we also define the kinematic density for $PSH(1)$ and show the probability of randomly throwing a vector $v$ interesting the convex domain $D\subset D_0$ under the condition that $v$ is contained in $D_0$.

As an application, if $X$ is an $N$-dimensional compact K\""ahler manifold with holonomy group $SU(N)$, the space of holomorphic vector fields on its jet scheme $J_m(X)$ is calculated.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03863;Lorentzian Kleinian Groups; Thierry Barbot (LANLG);"  Classical Kleinian groups are discrete subgroups of isometries of H n. The well-known theory of Kleinian groups starts with the definition of their associated limit set in the boundary of H n , and includes the geometric properties of the quotient hyperbolic space. This approach, naively applied, fails in the Lorentzian analogue anti-de Sitter space: discrete subgroups do not act properly discontinuously, and in many cases the set of accumulation points of orbits at the conformal boundary at infinity depends on the orbit. In this survey, we point out a way to extend this classical theory by introducing causality notions: the theory of limit sets and regularity domains extend naturally to achronal subgroups. This is closely related to the notions of globally hyper-bolic spacetimes, and we present what is known about the classification of globally hyperbolic spacetimes of constant curvature. We also review the close connection revealed by G. Mess ([79]) between globally hyperbolic spacetimes of dimension 2 + 1 and Teichm{\""u}ller space. This link can be understood via the space of time-like geodesics of anti-de Sitter space, and this space has also an interesting role, presented here, in the recent works about proper group actions on spacetimes of constant curvature.

In particular, we consider the magnetic ray transform of the combinations of tensors of different orders due to the nature of magnetic flows. We show that such magnetic ray transforms can be stably inverted, up to natural obstructions, near a strictly convex (with respect to magnetic geodesics) boundary point. Moreover, a global invertibility result follows on a compact Riemannian manifold with strictly convex boundary assuming that some global foliation condition is satisfied. ;"Differential Geometry (math.DG); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)"

Neither of these Lie algebras is preserved under Morita equivalence of Lie groupoids. We show this pair of Lie algebras assemble into a Lie 2-algebra that is Morita invariant: given two Morita equivalent Lie groupoids their Lie 2-algebras are related by a (version of) Noohi's butterfly. Furthermore, the underlying category of this Lie 2-algebra is naturally equivalent to Hepworth's category of vector fields on the stack associated to the Lie groupoid. ;"Differential Geometry (math.DG); Category Theory (math.CT)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04006;From unbalanced optimal transport to the Camassa-Holm equation; Thomas Gallouët (CMLS),  François-Xavier Vialard;"  The group of diffeomorphisms of a compact manifold endowed with the L^2 metric acting on the space of probability densities gives a unifying framework for the incompressible Euler equation and the theory of optimal mass transport. Recently, several authors have extended optimal transport to the space of positive Radon measures where the Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao distance is a natural extension of the classical L^2-Wasserstein distance. In this paper, we show a similar relation between this unbalanced optimal transport problem and the Hdiv right-invariant metric on the group of diffeomorphisms, which corresponds to the Camassa-Holm (CH) equation in one dimension. On the optimal transport side, we prove a polar factorization theorem on the automorphism group of half-densities.Geometrically, our point of view provides an isometric embedding of the group of diffeomorphisms endowed with this right-invariant metric in the automorphisms group of the fiber bundle of half densities endowed with an L^2 type of cone metric. This leads to a new formulation of the (generalized) CH equation as a geodesic equation on an isotropy subgroup of this automorphisms group; On S1, solutions to the standard CH thus give particular solutions of the incompressible Euler equation on a group of homeomorphisms of R^2 which preserve a radial density that has a singularity at 0. An other application consists in proving that smooth solutions of the Euler-Arnold equation for the Hdiv right-invariant metric are length minimizing geodesics for sufficiently short times.

This result, besides giving an effective algorithm for the computation of the variational cohomology of an invariant Pfaffian system, provides a method for detecting obstructions to the existence of finite or infinitesimal actions leaving a given system invariant. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)

Transverse generalized complex structures do not rely heavily on the existence of a bundle-like metric, which makes them a convienient tool to study some non-Riemmanian foliations. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)

It is well known that $P$ is not a generalized curvature tensor and hence it possesses different geometric properties than other generalized curvature tensors. The main object of the present paper is to study some semisymmetric type and pseudosymmetric type curvature restricted geometric structures due to projective curvature tensor. The reduced pseudosymmetric type structures for various Walker type conditions are deduced and the existence of Venzi space is ensured. It is shown that the geometric structures formed by imposing projective operator on a (0,4)-tensor is different from that for the corresponding (1,3)-tensor. Characterization of various semisymmetric type and pseudosymmetric type curvature restricted geometric structures due to projective curvature tensor is obtained on a Riemannian and a semi-Riemannian manifold, and it is shown that some of them reduce to Einstein manifold for the Riemann case. Finally to support our theorems four suitable examples are presented. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)

We study the cases where the scalar curvature of the warped product and of the base are either both positive or both negative to complement the results in [Kr\""o16]. Up to a small gap in the case of sin-cones, the stability properties of such warped products are now completely determined by spectral properties of the Laplacian and the Einstein operator of the base manifold. For cosh-cylinders, we are furthermore able to prove a convergence result for the Ricci flow starting in a small neighbourhood. As an interesting class of examples, we determine the stability properties of sin-cones over symmetric spaces of compact type. ";"Differential Geometry (math.DG); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)"

The most familiar such fibrations $\pi: \widetilde{M} \to M$ are the natural fibrations of Stieffel manifolds $SO(n_1 + n_2)/SO(n_1)$ over Grassmann manifolds $SO(n_1 + n_2)/[SO(n_1)\times SO(n_2)]$ and the twistor space bundles over quaternionic symmetric spaces (= quaternion-Kaehler symmetric spaces = Wolf spaces). The most familiar of these coverings $\varphi: \widetilde{M} \to \Gamma\backslash \widetilde{M}$ are the universal riemannian coverings of spherical space forms. When $M = G/K$ is reasonably well understood, in particular when $G/K$ is a riemannian symmetric space or when $K$ is a connected subgroup of maximal rank in $G$, we show that the Homogeneity Conjecture holds for $\widetilde{M}$. In other words we show that $\Gamma\backslash \widetilde{M}$ is homogeneous if and only if every $\gamma \in \Gamma$ is an isometry of constant displacement. In order to find all the isometries of constant displacement on $\widetilde{M}$ we work out the full isometry group of $\widetilde{M}$, extending Elie Cartan's determination of the full group of isometries of a riemannian symmetric space. We also discuss some pseudo-riemannian extensions of our results. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05660;The Riemann minimal examples; William H. Meeks III,  Joaquin Perez;  Near the end of his life, Bernhard Riemann made the marvelous discovery of a 1-parameter family $R_{\lambda}$, $\lambda\in (0,\infty)$, of periodic properly embedded minimal surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with the property that every horizontal plane intersects each of his examples in either a circle or a straight line. Furthermore, as the parameter $\lambda\to 0$ his surfaces converge to a vertical catenoid and as $\lambda\to \infty$ his surfaces converge to a vertical helicoid. Since Riemann's minimal examples are topologically planar domains that are periodic with the fundamental domains for the associated $\mathbb{Z}$-action being diffeomorphic to a compact annulus punctured in a single point, then topologically each of these surfaces is diffeomorphic to the unique genus zero surface with two limit ends. Also he described his surfaces analytically in terms of elliptic functions on rectangular elliptic curves. This article exams Riemann's original proof of the classification of minimal surfaces foliated by circles and lines in parallel planes and presents a complete outline of the recent proof that every properly embedded minimal planar domain in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is either a Riemann minimal example, a catenoid, a helicoid or a plane. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)

We give examples (in the noncompact case) of non-Abelian monopoles with Dirac type singularities, and examples of monopoles whose singularities are not of that type.

Kumpera;  In all the practical applications of partial differential equations, what is mostly needed and what is in fact hardest to obtains are the solutions of the system or, occasionally, some specific solutions. This work is based on a most enlightening M\'emoire written by \'Elie Cartan in 1914 and that the majority ignores. We discuss a setting for the local equivalence problem and illustrate it by some examples. It should also be noted that any integration process or method is in fact a local equivalence problem involving a suitable model. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)

Let $\Sigma$ be a connected, finitely connected, noncompact manifold without boundary. If $g$ is a complete Riemannian metric on $\Sigma$ whose Gaussian curvature $K$ is nonnegative at infinity, then $K$ must be integrable. In particular, we obtain a new short proof of the fact that if $\Sigma$ admits a complete metric whose Gaussian curvature is nonnegative and positive at one point, then $\Sigma$ is diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^2$. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08015;Adiabatic groupoids and secondary invariants in K-theory; Vito Felice Zenobi;"  In this paper we define K-theoretic secondary invariants attached to a Lie groupoid $G$. The K-theory of $C^*_r(G_{ad}^0)$ (where $G_{ad}^0$ is the adiabatic deformation $G$ restricted to the interval $[0,1)$) is the receptacle for K-theoretic secondary invariants. We give a Lie groupoid version of construction given by Piazza and Schick in the setting of the Coarse Geometry. Our construction directly generalises to more involved geometrical situation, such as foliations, well encoded by a Lie groupoid. Along the way we tackle the problem of producing a wrong-way functoriality between adiabatic deformation groupoid K-groups with respect to transverse maps. This extends the construction of the lower shriek map given by Connes and Skandalis. Moreover we attach a secondary invariant to the two following operators: the signature operator on a pair of homotopically equivalent Lie groupoids; the Dirac operator on a Lie groupoid equipped with a metric that has positive scalar curvature $s$-fiber-wise. Furthermore we prove a Lie groupoid version of the Delocalized APS Index Theorem of Piazza and Schick. Finally we give a product formula for the secondary invariants and we state stability results about cobordism classes of Lie groupoid structures and bordism classes of Lie groupoid metric with positive scalar curvature along the $s$-fibers.

This extends a previous result of the author for codimension $l = 1$.

We use a tensor maximum principle for the induced metric to establish two-sided bounds on the singular values of Du, which shows that unlike harmonic map heat flow, this flow preserves diffeomorphisms. A change of variables for Du then allows us to establish a $C^\alpha$ estimate for the coefficient of the tension field, and thus (thanks to the quasilinear structure and the Schauder estimates) we get full regularity and long-time existence. We conclude with some energy estimates to show convergence to an affine diffeomorphism. ;"Differential Geometry (math.DG); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)"

Two types of these structures are discussed. In the first case, we construct an almost complex structure on a product manifold mirroring K-structures. We show that the natural normality condition can be satisfied only when g is abelian. The second case we consider is when the Lie algebra in question is 3-dimensional, but the almost complex structure on a product is constructed in a different manner. In both cases the normality conditions are expressed in terms of the structure tensors. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)

We prove that if $(g,k)$ is sufficiently close to the initial data for Minkowski space, then there exists an asymptotically flat solution $(g',k')$ on $\mathbb{R}^3$ that extends $(g,k)$. Moreover, $(g',k')$ depends continuously on $(g,k)$ and has the same regularity. Our proof uses a new method of solving the prescribed divergence equation for a tracefree symmetric $2$-tensor, and a geometric variant of the conformal method to solve the prescribed scalar curvature equation for a metric. Both methods are based on the implicit function theorem and an expansion of tensors based on spherical harmonics. They are combined to define an iterative scheme that is shown to converge to a global solution $(g',k')$ of the maximal constraint equations which extends $(g,k)$. ;"Differential Geometry (math.DG); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)"

For an embedded translating soliton $\Sigma$ with nonnegative scalar curvature, we prove that if the mean curvature of $\Sigma$ does not change signs on each end, then $\Sigma$ must have positive scalar curvature unless it is either a hyperplane or a grim hyperplane. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09142;Minimal hypersurfaces and bordism of positive scalar curvature metrics; Boris Botvinnik,  Demetre Kazaras;  Let $(Y,g)$ be a compact Riemannian manifold of positive scalar curvature (psc). It is well-known, due to Schoen-Yau, that any closed stable minimal hypersurface of $Y$ also admits a psc-metric. We establish an analogous result for stable minimal hypersurfaces with free boundary. Furthermore, we combine this result with tools from geometric measure theory and conformal geometry to study psc-bordism. For instance, assume $(Y_0,g_0)$ and $(Y_1,g_1)$ are closed psc-manifolds equipped with stable minimal hypersurfaces $X_0 \subset Y_0$ and $X_1\subset Y_1$. Under natural topological conditions, we show that a psc-bordism $(Z,\bar g) : (Y_0,g_0)\rightsquigarrow (Y_1,g_1)$ gives rise to a psc-bordism between $X_0$ and $X_1$ equipped with the psc-metrics given by the Schoen-Yau construction. ;"Differential Geometry (math.DG); Algebraic Topology (math.AT); Geometric Topology (math.GT)"

This derivative is then used to define a one-sided directional derivative for the uniform energy which allows us to identify gradient-like vectors at those points where the function is not differentiable. These vectors are used to restart the standard negative gradient flow of the Morse energy at its critical points. We illustrate this procedure on the flat torus and demonstrate that the restarted flow improves the minimizing properties of the associated closed geodesics. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)

For each of those cases we obtain the Euler-Lagrange equation and its several solutions.

The resulting manifold $X$ is complex if and only if $Q$ admits a holomorphic map to $\mathbb{P}^1$. We make branched double covers of these manifolds. Some class of these branched double covers can give rise to non-Kahler Calabi-Yau manifolds. We show that these manifolds $X$ and their branched double covers are non-Kahler. In the cases that $Q$ is a balanced manifold, the resulting manifold $X$ and its special branched double cover have balanced Hermitian metrics. ;"Differential Geometry (math.DG); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)"

The Hawking mass gives a well-known lower bound, and an upper bound is obtained by estimating the mass of a static vacuum extension. As an application we confirm that in a time-symmetric slice concentric geodesic balls shrinking to a point have mass-to-volume ratio converging to the energy density at their center, in accord with physical expectation and the behavior of other quasilocal masses. For balls shrinking to a flat point we can also compute the outer mass to fifth order in the radius---the term is proportional to the Laplacian of the scalar curvature at the center---but our estimate is not refined enough to identify this term at a point which is merely scalar flat. In particular it cannot discern gravitational contributions to the mass. ;"Differential Geometry (math.DG); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)"

These critical maps are referred to as $(H,\widetilde{H})$-harmonic maps. We derive a CR Bochner formula for the horizontal energy density $|df_{H, \widetilde{H}}|^{2}$, and introduce a Paneitz type operator acting on maps to refine the Bochner formula. As a result, we are able to establish some Bochner type theorems for $(H,\widetilde{H})$-harmonic maps. We also introduce $(H,\widetilde{H})$-pluriharmonic, $(H,\widetilde{H})$-holomorphic maps between these manifolds, which provide us examples of $(H,\widetilde{H})$-harmonic maps.

Let $G/K$ be a generalized flag manifold with $K=C(S)=S\times K_1$, where $S$ is a torus in a compact simple Lie group $G$ and $K_1$ is the semisimple part of $K$. Then the {\it associated $M$-space} is the homogeneous space $G/K_1$. These spaces were introduced and studied by H.C. Wang in 1954. We prove that for various classes of $M$-spaces the only g.o. metric is the standard metric. For other classes of $M$-spaces we give either necessary, or necessary and sufficient conditions, so that a $G$-invariant metric on $G/K_1$ is a g.o. metric. We consider $M$-spaces determined by classical and exceptional Lie groups. The analysis is based on properties of the isotropy representation $\mathfrak{m}=\mathfrak{m}_1\oplus \cdots\oplus \mathfrak{m}_s$ of the flag manifold $G/K$.

In this article we study the relations between the flag curvature of the Randers manifold $(TG,\widetilde{F})$ and the sectional curvature of the Riemannian manifold $(G,g)$ when $\widetilde{F}$ is of Berwald type. Then we give all simply connected $3$-dimentional Lie groups such that their tangent bundles admit Randers metrics of Berwarld type and their geodesics vectors. ;"Differential Geometry (math.DG); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01596;On the cut locus of free, step two Carnot groups; Luca Rizzi,  Ulysse Serres;  In this note, we study the cut locus of the free, step two Carnot groups $\mathbb{G}_k$ with $k$ generators, equipped with their left-invariant Carnot-Carath\'eodory metric. In particular, we disprove the conjectures on the shape of the cut loci proposed in [Myasnichenko - 2002] and [Montanari, Morbidelli - 2016], by exhibiting sets of cut points $C_k \subset \mathbb{G}_k$ which, for $k \geq 4$, are strictly larger than conjectured ones. While the latter were, respectively, smooth semi-algebraic sets of codimension $\Theta(k^2)$ and semi-algebraic sets of codimension $\Theta(k)$, the sets $C_k$ are semi-algebraic and have codimension $2$, yielding the best possible lower bound valid for all $k$ on the size of the cut locus of $\mathbb{G}_k$. Furthermore, we study the relation of the cut locus with the so-called abnormal set. In the low dimensional cases, it is known that \[ \mathrm{Abn}_0(\mathbb{G}_k) = \overline{\mathrm{Cut}_0(\mathbb{G}_k)} \setminus \mathrm{Cut}_0(\mathbb{G}_k), \qquad k=2,3. \] For each $k \geq 4$, instead, we show that the cut locus always intersects the abnormal set, and there are plenty of abnormal geodesics with finite cut time. Finally, and as a straightforward consequence of our results, we derive an explicit lower bound for the small time heat kernel asymptotics at the points of $C_k$. The question whether $C_k$ coincides with the cut locus for $k\geq 4$ remains open. ;"Differential Geometry (math.DG); Optimization and Control (math.OC)"

Our results are then applied to obtain elegant characterizations of double vector bundles and graded bundles of degree 2. All these results have their supergeometric counterparts. For instance, we give a simple proof of a nice characterisation of $N$-manifolds of degree 2, announced in the literature. ;"Differential Geometry (math.DG); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)"

We study its negative gradient flow on holomorphic pairs $(A,u)$ where $A$ is a connection on a principal $G$-bundle $P$ over a closed Riemann surface $\Sigma$ and $u: P \rightarrow X$ is an equivariant map into a K\""ahler Hamiltonian $G$-manifold. The connection $A$ induces a holomorphic structure on the K\""ahler fibration $P\times_G X$ and we require that $u$ descends to a holomorphic section of this fibration.

As applications we establish several results inspired by finite dimensional GIT: First, we prove a certain uniqueness property for the critical points of the Yang--Mills--Higgs functional which is the analogue of the Ness uniqueness theorem. Second, we extend Mundet's Kobayashi--Hitchin correspondence to the polystable and semistable case. The arguments for the polystable case lead to a new proof in the stable case. Third, in proving the semistable correspondence, we establish the moment-weight inequality for the vortex equation and prove the analogue of the Kempf existence and uniqueness theorem.

In fact, it could also be regarded as an analytic model of differential $K$-theory for closed orbifolds. Furthermore, we construct a well-defined push-forward map in equivariant differential $K$-theory and prove the properties of it. In order to do these, we extend the Melrose-Piazza spectral section to the equivariant case, introduce the equivariant version of higher spectral flow for arbitrary dimensional fibers and use them to prove the anomaly formula and the functoriality of the equivariant Bismut-Cheeger eta forms. ;"Differential Geometry (math.DG); K-Theory and Homology (math.KT)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02428;The Calabi metric and desingularization of Einstein orbifolds; Peyman Morteza,  Jeff A. Viaclovsky;"  Consider an Einstein orbifold $(M_0,g_0)$ of real dimension $2n$ having a singularity with orbifold group the cyclic group of order $n$ in ${\rm{SU}}(n)$ which is generated by an $n$th root of unity times the identity. Existence of a Ricci-flat K\""ahler ALE metric with this group at infinity was shown by Calabi. There is a natural ""approximate"" Einstein metric on the desingularization of $M_0$ obtained by replacing a small neighborhood of the singular point of the orbifold with a scaled and truncated Calabi metric. In this paper, we identify the first obstruction to perturbing this approximate Einstein metric to an actual Einstein metric. If $M_0$ is compact, we can use this to produce examples of Einstein orbifolds which do not admit any Einstein metric in a neighborhood of the natural approximate Einstein metric on the desingularization. In the case that $(M_0,g_0)$ is asymptotically hyperbolic Einstein and non-degenerate, we show that if the first obstruction vanishes, then there does in fact exist an asymptotically hyperbolic Einstein metric on the desingularization. We also obtain a non-existence result in the asymptotically hyperbolic Einstein case, provided that the obstruction does not vanish. This work extends a construction of Biquard in the case $n =2$, in which case the Calabi metric is also known as the Eguchi-Hanson metric, but there are some key points for which the higher-dimensional case differs.

Also we define a resolution of singularities of a branched section, and prove an analog of Hopf-Poincar\'e-Gauss-Bonnet theorem for the branched sections admitting a resolution.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02739;Anomaly flows; Duong H. Phong,  Sebastien Picard,  Xiangwen Zhang;  The anomaly flow is a flow which implements the Green-Schwarz anomaly cancellation mechanism originating from superstring theory, while preserving the conformally balanced condition of Hermitian metrics. There are several versions of the flow, depending on whether the gauge field also varies, or is assumed known. A distinctive feature of anomaly flows is that, in $m$ dimensions, the flow of the Hermitian metric has to be inferred from the flow of its $(m-1)$-th power $\omega^{m-1}$. We show how this can be done explicitly, and we work out the corresponding flows for the torsion and the curvature tensors. The results are applied to produce criteria for the long-time existence of the flow, in the simplest case of zero slope parameter. ;"Differential Geometry (math.DG); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Complex Variables (math.CV)"

It is also the first case where the anomaly flow can even be shown to exist for all time.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02898;Energy Identity for Stationary Yang Mills; A. Naber,  D. Valtorta;  Given a principal bundle $P\to M$ over a Riemannian manifold with compact structure group $G$, let us consider a stationary Yang-Mills connection $A$ with energy $\int_M |F_A|^2\le \Lambda$. If we consider a sequence of such connections $A_i$, then it is understood that up to subsequence we can converge $A_i\to A$ to a singular limit connection such that the energy measures converge $|F_{A_i}|^2 dv_g\to |F_A|^2dv_g +\nu$, where $\nu=e(x)d\lambda^{n-4}$ is the $n-4$ rectifiable defect measure. Our main result is to show, without additional assumptions, that for $n-4$ a.e. point the energy density $e(x)$ may be computed explicitly as the sum of the bubble energies arising from blow ups at $x$. Each of these bubbles may be realized as a Yang Mills connection over $S^4$ itself. Our second main theorem is to show this hessian bound holds automatically. Precisely, given a connection $A$ as above we have the apriori estimate $\int_M |\nabla^2 F_A| < C(\Lambda,\dim G,M)$ for the curvature. It is important to note this result is proved in tandem with the energy quantization, and not before it. Indeed, we will in fact prove an effective version of the energy identity, and it is this effective version which will lead to both the $L^1$ hessian bound and the classical energy quantization results. In the course of the proof we will provide a quantitative version of the bubble tree decomposition which hold in all dimensions with effective estimates for a fixed stationary connections. To produce to strongest estimates in the paper we introduce an $\epsilon$-gauge condition, which generalizes the usual Coulomb gauge and which will exist, with effective control, even over singular regions. On these $\epsilon$-gauges we will provide a new superconvexity estimate which will be a key tool in analyzing higher dimensional annular regions. ;"Differential Geometry (math.DG); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02932;Ricci curvature and Orientability; Shouhei Honda;  In this paper we define an orientation of a measured Gromov-Hausdorff limit space of Riemannian manifolds with uniform Ricci bounds from below. This is the first observation of orientability for metric measure spaces. Our orientability has two fundamental properties. One of them is the stability with respect to noncollapsed sequences. As a corollary we see that if the cross section of a tangent cone of a noncollapsed limit space of orientable Riemannian manifolds is smooth, then it is also orientable in the ordinary sense, which can be regarded as a new obstruction for a given manifold to be the cross section of a tangent cone. The other one is that there are only two choices for orientations on a limit space. We also discuss relationships between $L^2$-convergence of orientations and convergence of currents in metric spaces. In particular for a noncollapsed sequence, we prove a compatibility between the intrinsic flat convergence by Sormani-Wenger, the pointed flat convergence by Lang-Wenger, and the Gromov-Hausdorff convergence, which is a generalization of a recent work by Matveev-Portegies to the noncompact case. Moreover combining this compatibility with the second property of our orientation gives an explicit formula for the limit integral current by using an orientation on a limit space. Finally dualities between de Rham cohomologies on an oriented limit space are proven. ;"Differential Geometry (math.DG); Functional Analysis (math.FA); Metric Geometry (math.MG)"

These issues were recently discussed in the work of Jan Sbierski [17], in which he established the (nonobvious) fact that the Schwarschild solution in global Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates is $C^0$-inextendible. In this paper we review aspects of Sbierski's methodology in a general context, and use similar techniques, along with some new observations, to consider the $C^0$-inextendibility of open FLRW cosmological models. We find that a certain special class of open FLRW spacetimes, which we have dubbed `Milne-like,' actually admit $C^0$ extensions through the big bang. For spacetimes that are not Milne-like, we prove some inextendibility results within the class of spherically symmetric spacetimes. ;"Differential Geometry (math.DG); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)"

More generally we characterize, via optimal transport, lower (and, in some cases, upper) bounds on the so called $p$-Ricci curvature which corresponds to taking the trace of the Riemann curvature tensor on $p$-dimensional planes, $1\leq p\leq n$. Such characterization roughly consists on a convexity condition of the $p$-Reny entropy along $L^{2}$-Wasserstein geodesics, where the role of reference measure is played by the $p$-dimensional Hausdorff measure.

In dimension four we show that the shape of a square is locally stable under perturbations along a hypersurface of all possible perturbations. Furthermore, we are able to show that under a lower bound on angles there exists a rescaled sequence extracted from the evolution that converges to a limiting polygon that is a self-similar solution of the flow.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03949;Frobenius integrability and Finsler metrizability for $2$-dimensional  sprays; Ioan Bucataru,  Georgeta Creţu,  Ebtsam H. Taha;  For a $2$-dimensional non-flat spray we associate a Berwald frame and a $3$-dimensional distribution that we call the Berwald distribution. The Frobenius integrability of the Berwald distribution characterises the Finsler metrizability of the given spray. In the integrable case, the sought after Finsler function is provided by a closed, homogeneous $1$-form from the annihilator of the Berwald distribution. We discuss both the degenerate and non-degenerate cases using the fact that the regularity of the Finsler function is encoded into a regularity condition of a $2$-form, canonically associated to the given spray. The integrability of the Berwald distribution and the regularity of the $2$-form have simple and useful expressions in terms of the Berwald frame. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)

Every module of the Clifford algebra $Cl_k$ defines a particular vector bundle over $\S^{k+1}$, a generalized Hopf bundle, and the theorem asserts that this correspondence between $Cl_k$-modules and stable vector bundles over $\S^{k+1}$ is an isomorphism modulo $Cl_{k+1}$-modules. We prove this theorem directly, based on explicit deformations as in Milnor's book on Morse theory \cite{M}, and without referring to the Bott periodicity theorem as in \cite{ABS}. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)

In this paper we obtain some criteria ensuring strong stability of surfaces in Sasakian $3$-manifolds. We also produce new examples of $C^1$ complete CMC surfaces with empty singular set in the sub-Riemannian $3$-space forms by studying those ones containing a vertical line. As a consequence, we are able to find complete strongly stable non-vertical surfaces with empty singular set in the sub-Riemannian hyperbolic $3$-space $\mathbb{M}(-1)$. In relation to the Bernstein problem in $\mathbb{M}(-1)$ we discover strongly stable $C^\infty$ entire minimal graphs in $\mathbb{M}(-1)$ different from vertical planes. These examples are in clear contrast with the situation in the first Heisenberg group, where complete strongly stable surfaces with empty singular set are vertical planes. Finally, we analyze the strong stability of CMC surfaces of class $C^2$ and non-empty singular set in the sub-Riemannian $3$-space forms. When these surfaces have isolated singular points we deduce their strong stability even for variations moving the singular set. ;"Differential Geometry (math.DG); Metric Geometry (math.MG)"

We study various integrability conditions of the almost CR structure in our spinorial setup, including the classical integrability of a CR structure as well as those implied by Killing-type conditions on the partially pure spinor field. In the codimension one case, we develop a spinorial description of strictly pseudoconvex CR manifolds, metric contact manifolds and Sasakian manifolds.

As a further consequence of the classification, we produce examples of some other interesting phenomena, such as: irreducible $G_2$-instantons that, as the structure varies, merge into the same reducible and obstructed one; and $G_2$-instantons on nearly parallel $G_2$-manifolds that are not locally energy minimizing.

The point of this construction is that one can characterize stability, semi-stability and polystability of a point by numerical criteria, that is in terms of a function called maximal weight. We apply this setting to the actions of a real non-compact reductive Lie group G on a real compact submanifold M of a Kaehler manifold Z and to the action of G on measures of M. ;"Differential Geometry (math.DG); Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)"

The curve $\Gamma$ is the graph of a quasisymmetric homeomorphism of the circle if and only if the $K$-surfaces have bounded principal curvatures. Moreover in this case a uniqueness result holds. The proofs rely on a well-known correspondence between spacelike surfaces in Anti-de Sitter space and area-preserving diffeomorphisms of the hyperbolic plane. In fact, an important ingredient is a representation formula, which reconstructs a spacelike surface from the associated area-preserving diffeomorphism. Using this correspondence we then deduce that, for any fixed $\theta\in(0,\pi)$, every quasisymmetric homeomorphism of the circle admits a unique extension which is a $\theta$-landslide of the hyperbolic plane. These extensions are quasiconformal. ;"Differential Geometry (math.DG); Complex Variables (math.CV); General Topology (math.GN)"

We construct a family of quaternionic complexes over unimodular quaternionic manifolds by elementary calculation. On complex quaternionic manifolds, which are essentially the complexification of real analytic quaternionic K\""ahler manifolds, the existence of these complexes was established by Baston by using twistor transformations and spectral sequences. Unimodular quaternionic manifolds constitute a nice and large class of quaternionic manifolds: the conformal change of a unimodular quaternionic structure is still unimodular quaternionic and the complexes over such manifolds are conformally invariant. This class of manifolds, including quaternionic K\""ahler manifolds, are the real version of torsion-free QCFs introduced by Bailey and Eastwood. We show the ellipticity of these complexes and its Hodge-type decomposition.

We classify compact Hermitian manifolds with constant non-zero real bisectional curvature, and also slightly extend Wu-Yau's theorem to the Hermitian case.

Having the same mean curvature means that there exists a parallel vector bundle isometry between the normal bundles that preserves the mean curvature vector fields. We prove that if both Gauss lifts of a compact surface to the twistor bundle are not vertically harmonic, then there exist at most three nontrivial congruence classes. We show that surfaces with a vertically harmonic Gauss lift, allow locally a one-parameter family of isometric deformations with the same mean curvature. This family is trivial only if the surface is superconformal. For such compact surfaces with non-parallel mean curvature, we prove that the moduli space is the disjoint union of two sets, each one being either finite, or a circle. In particular, for surfaces in $\R^4$ we prove that the moduli space is a finite set, under a condition on the Euler numbers of the tangent and normal bundles. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)

For a broad class of possible speed functions, we show that any closed convex hypersurface converges to a round sphere. The proof is based on the monotonicity of the isoperimetric ratio, which allows to control the inner and outer radius of the hypersurface and to deduce uniform bounds on the curvature by maximum principle arguments. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)

The boundary of such a manifold has a CMC component, i.e. a $2$-sphere with positive constant mean curvature; and the rest of the boundary, if nonempty, consists of closed minimal surfaces. A key step in our proof is the construction of a collar extension that is inspired by the method of Mantoulidis-Schoen \cite{M-S}.

The Riemannian cone over $Y$ has the holonomy group contained in ${\rm Spin(7)}$ and the Riemannian cone over $A$ is a Cayley submanifold.

We give a necessary and sufficient condition for an infinitesimal associative deformation to be integrable (unobstructed) to second order explicitly. As an application, we show that the infinitesimal deformations of a homogeneous associative submanifold in the 7-sphere given by Lotay, which he called $A_3$, are unobstructed to second order. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)

In this paper, we investigate twinnings of rPD surfaces, a family of rhombohedral deformations of Schwarz' Primitive (P) and Diamond (D) surfaces, and twinnings of the Gyroid (G) surface. Small examples of rPD twins have been constructed in Fijomori and Weber (2009), where we observe non-examples near the helicoid limit. Examples of rPD twins near the catenoid limit follow from Traizet (2008). Large examples of rPD and G twins are numerically constructed in Surface Evolver. A structural study of the G twins brings new insights into the G surface, based on which we speculate a new path of embedded TPMS connecting the G surface to the D surface. ;"Differential Geometry (math.DG); Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08162;On Lawson-Osserman Constructions; Xiaowei Xu,  Ling Yang,  Yongsheng Zhang;  Lawson-Osserman constructed three types of non-parametric minimal cones of high codimensions based on Hopf maps between spheres, which correspond to Lipschitz but non-differentiable solutions to the minimal surface equations, thereby making sharp contrast to the regularity theorem for minimal graphs of codimension 1. In this paper, we develop the constructions in a more general scheme. Once a mapping f between unit spheres is composited of a harmonic Riemannian submersion and a homothetic (i.e., up to a constant factor, isometric) minimal immersion, certain twisted graph of f can yield a non-parametric minimal cone. Because the choices of the second component usually form a huge moduli space, our constructions produce a constellation of uncountably many examples. For each such cone, there exists an entire minimal graph whose tangent cone at infinity is just the given one. Moreover, new phenomena on the existence, non-uniqueness and non-minimizing of solutions to the related Dirichlet problem are discovered. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)

It is shown that the flow exists on a finite maximal interval, convexity is preserved and the hypersurfaces shrink down to a single point as the final time is approached.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08214;Mixed volume preserving flow by powers of homogeneous curvature  functions of degree one; Shunzi Guo;  This paper concerns the evolution of a closed hypersurface of dimension $n(\geq 2)$ in the Euclidean space ${\mathbb{R}}^{n+1}$ under a mixed volume preserving flow. The speed equals a power $\beta (\geq 1)$ of homogeneous, either convex or concave, curvature functions of degree one plus a mixed volume preserving term, including the case of powers of the mean curvature and of the Gauss curvature. The main result is that if the initial hypersurface satisfies a suitable pinching condition, there exists a unique, smooth solution of the flow for all times, and the evolving hypersurfaces converge exponentially to a round sphere, enclosing the same mixed volume as the initial hypersurface. This result covers and generalises the previous results for convex hypersurfaces in the Euclidean space by McCoy \cite{McC05} and Cabezas-Rivas and Sinestrari \cite{CS10} to more general curvature flows for convex hypersurfaces with similar curvature pinching condition. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)

In contrast to the classical Tanaka symbol, the set of Jacobi symbols is discrete and classifiable. We give an explicit and unified algebraic procedure for the construction of the canonical frames (the structure of absolute parallelism) for all distribution with given Jacobi symbol. We describe all Jacobi symbols for which this procedure ends up in a finite number of steps (i.e. all Jacobi symbols of finite type) and distinguish the symplectically flat distributions with given Jacobi symbol, which in the case of finite type are the maximally symmetric distribution among all distribution with given Jacobi symbol. Also, for the most of Jacobi symbols we relate the prolongation procedure and the resulting prolongation algebra, which is the algebra of infinitesimal symmetries of the corresponding symplectically flat distribution, to the standard (in the sense of Kobayashi and Sternberg) prolongation of certain subspace in the algebra of infinitesimal symmetries of the flat (unparametrized) curve of flags associated with the Jacobi symbol. Finally, we give an upper bounds for the size of the resulting prolongation algebra in terms of certain spaces of polynomials vanishing on certain projective varieties. For some class of Jacobi symbols we are able to identify the resulting prolongation algebra with such spaces of polynomials. In this way we get the description of the prolongation algebra for all Jacobi symbols of finite type appearing in rank 2 and rank 3 distributions and also for most of such Jacobi symbols appearing in rank 4 distributions. In particular, in the case of rank 3 distributions this description is given in terms of the tangential developable and the secant varieties of a rational normal curve. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)

We show that there exists a smooth Ricci flow starting from such a metric with curvature decaying like C/t. The initial metric is attained in Gromov-Hausdorff distance and smoothly away from the singular points. In the case that the initial manifold has isolated singularities asymptotic to a non-negatively curved cone over $(\mathbb{S}^{n-1}/\Gamma,g)$, where $\Gamma$ acts freely and properly discontinuously, we extend the above result by showing that starting from such an initial condition there exists a smooth Ricci flow with isolated orbifold singularities. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)

When $X$ is a Stein manifold (but not restricted to be a domain of holomorphy), we extract equivalent descriptions of the bulk algebra and of the category of topological D-branes which are constructed using only the analytic space associated to $X$. In particular, we show that the D-brane category is described by projective matrix factorizations defined over the ring of holomorphic functions of $X$. We also discuss simplifications of the analytic models which arise when $X$ is holomorphically parallelizable and illustrate these analytic models in a few classes of examples. ;"Differential Geometry (math.DG); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Complex Variables (math.CV)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09836;Conjectures on counting associative 3-folds in $G_2$-manifolds; Dominic Joyce;"  There is a strong analogy between compact, torsion-free $G_2$-manifolds $(X,\varphi,*\varphi)$ and Calabi-Yau 3-folds $(Y,J,g,\omega)$. We can also generalize $(X,\varphi,*\varphi)$ to 'tamed almost $G_2$-manifolds' $(X,\varphi,\psi)$, where we compare $\varphi$ with $\omega$ and $\psi$ with $J$. Associative 3-folds in $X$, a special kind of minimal submanifold, are analogous to $J$-holomorphic curves in $Y$. Several areas of Symplectic Geometry -- Gromov-Witten theory, Quantum Cohomology, Lagrangian Floer cohomology, Fukaya categories -- are built using 'counts' of moduli spaces of $J$-holomorphic curves in $Y$, but give an answer depending only on the symplectic manifold $(Y,\omega)$, not on the (almost) complex structure $J$. We investigate whether it may be possible to define interesting invariants of tamed almost $G_2$-manifolds $(X,\varphi,\psi)$ by 'counting' compact associative 3-folds $N\subset X$, such that the invariants depend only on $\varphi$, and are independent of the 4-form $\psi$ used to define associative 3-folds. We conjecture that one can define a superpotential $\Phi_\psi:{\mathcal U}\to\Lambda_{>0}$ 'counting' associative $\mathbb Q$-homology 3-spheres $N\subset X$ which is deformation-invariant in $\psi$ for $\varphi$ fixed, up to certain reparametrizations $\Upsilon:{\mathcal U}\to{\mathcal U}$ of the base ${\mathcal U}=$Hom$(H_3(X;{\mathbb Z}),1+\Lambda_{>0})$, where $\Lambda_{>0}$ is a Novikov ring. Using this we define a notion of '$G_2$ quantum cohomology'. These ideas may be relevant to String Theory or M-Theory on $G_2$-manifolds. We also discuss Donaldson and Segal's proposal in arXiv:0902.3239, section 6.2, to define invariants 'counting' $G_2$-instantons on tamed almost $G_2$-manifolds $(X,\varphi,\psi)$, with 'compensation terms' counting weighted pairs of a $G_2$-instanton and an associative 3-fold, and suggest some modifications to it.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.00290;Heinz mean curvature estimates in warped product spaces  $M\times_{e^ψ}N$; Isabel M.C. Salavessa;  If a graph submanifold $(x,f(x))$ of a Riemannian warped product space $(M^m\times_{e^{\psi}}N^n,\tilde{g}=g+e^{2\psi}h)$ is immersed with parallel mean curvature $H$, then we obtain a Heinz type estimation of the mean curvature. Namely, on each compact domain $D$ of $M$, $m\|H\|\leq \frac{A_{\psi}(\partial D)}{V_{\psi}(D)}$ holds, where $A_{\psi}(\partial D)$ and $V_{\psi}(D)$ are the ${\psi}$-weighted area and volume, respectively. In particular, $H=0$ if $(M,g)$ has zero weighted Cheeger constant, a concept recently introduced by D.\ Impera et al.\ (\cite{[Im]}). This generalizes the known cases $n=1$ or $\psi=0$. We also conclude minimality using a closed calibration, assuming $(M,g_*)$ is complete where $g_*=g+e^{2\psi}f^*h$, and for some constants $\alpha\geq \delta\geq 0$, $C_1>0$ and $\beta\in [0,1)$, $\|\nabla^*\psi\|^2_{g_*}\leq \delta$, $\mathrm{Ricci}_{\psi,g_*}\geq \alpha$, and $det_g(g_*)\leq C_1 r^{2\beta}$ holds when $r\to +\infty$, where $r(x)$ is the distance function on $(M,g_*)$ from some fixed point. Both results rely on expressing the squared norm of the mean curvature as a weighted divergence of a suitable vector field. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)

In the last section we study ruled surfaces, which are \emph{centrally} normalized, i.e., their relative normals at each point lie on the corresponding central plane. Especially we study various properties of the Tchebychev vector field. We conclude the paper by the study of the central image of $\varPhi$. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.00959;String principal bundles and Courant algebroids; Yunhe Sheng,  Xiaomeng Xu,  Chenchang Zhu;"  Just like Atiyah Lie algebroids encode the infinitesimal symmetries of principal bundles, exact Courant algebroids are believed to encode the infinitesimal symmetries of $S^1$-gerbes. At the same time, transitive Courant algebroids may be viewed as the higher analogue of Atiyah Lie algebroids, and the non-commutative analogue of exact Courant algebroids. In this article, we explore what the ""principal bundle"" behind transitive Courant algebroids are, and they turn out to be principal 2-bundles of string groups. First, we construct the stack of principal 2-bundles of string groups with connection data. We prove a lifting theorem for the stack of string principal bundles with connections and show the multiplicity of the lifts once they exist. This is a differential geometrical refinement of what is known for string structures by Redden, Waldorf and Stolz-Teichner. We also extend the result of Bressler and Chen-Sti\'enon-Xu on extension obstruction involving transitive Courant algebroids to the case of transitive Courant algebroids with connections, as a lifting theorem with the description of multiplicity once liftings exist. At the end, we build a morphism between these two stacks. The morphism turns out to be neither injective nor surjective in general, which shows that the process of associating the ""higher Atiyah algebroid"" loses some information and at the same time, only some special transitive Courant algebroids come from string bundles.

We present a formula for the integral in the case where $N$ is a subsupermanifold which is appropriately non-degenerate with respect to $Q$.

In the case of a finite regularity potential or weight function, we prove the existence of a partial (six term) asymptotic expansion of the heat trace for small times as well as a suitable remainder estimate. We also demonstrate that the more precise asymptotic behavior of the remainder is determined by and conversely distinguishes higher (Sobolev) regularity on the potential or weight function. In the case of a smooth weight function, we determine the full asymptotic expansion of the heat trace for the drifting Laplacian for small times. We then use the heat trace to study the asymptotics of the eigenvalue counting function. In both cases the Weyl law coincides with the Weyl law for the Riemannian manifold with the standard Laplace-Beltrami operator. We conclude by demonstrating isospectrality results for the drifting Laplacian on compact manifolds. ";Differential Geometry (math.DG)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01273;Wind Riemannian spaceforms and Randers metrics of constant flag  curvature; Miguel Angel Javaloyes,  Miguel Sánchez;  Recently, wind Riemannian structures (WRS) have been introduced as a generalization of Randers and Kropina metrics. They are constructed from the natural data for Zermelo navigation problem, namely, a Riemannian metric $g_R$ and a vector field $W$ (the wind), where, now, the restriction of mild wind $g_R(W,W)<1$ is dropped. Here, the models of WRS spaceforms of constant flag curvature are determined. Indeed, the celebrated classification of Randers metrics of constant flag curvature by Bao, Robles and Shen, extended to the Kropina case in the works by Yoshikawa, Okubo and Sabau, can be used to obtain the local classification. For the global one, a suitable result on completeness for WRS yields the complete simply connected models. In particular, any of the local models in the Randers classification does admit an extension to a unique model of wind Riemannian structure, even if it cannot be extended as a complete Finslerian manifold. Thus, WRS's emerge as the natural framework for the analysis of Randers spaceforms and, prospectively, wind Finslerian structures would become important for other global problems too. For the sake of completeness, a brief overview about WRS (including a useful link with the conformal geometry of a class of relativistic spacetimes) is also provided. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)

While the first part of the series was devoted to the general study of these structures, the second part focused on the case that the underlying structure is conformally symplectic (PCS-structures). In that case, we obtained a close relation to parabolic contact structures via a concept of parabolic contactification. It was also shown that special symplectic connections (and thus all connections of exotic symplectic holonomy) arise as the canonical connection of such a structure. In this last part, we use parabolic contactifications and constructions related to Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand (BGG) sequences for parabolic contact structures, to construct sequences of differential operators naturally associated to a PCS-structure. In particular, this gives rise to a large family of complexes of differential operators associated to a special symplectic connection. In some cases, large families of complexes for more general instances of PCS-structures are obtained. ;"Differential Geometry (math.DG); Symplectic Geometry (math.SG)"

Pham;  A Lie version of Turaev's $\overline{G}$-Frobenius algebras from 2-dimensional homotopy quantum field theory is proposed. The foundation for this Lie version is a structure we call a \textit{$\frak{g}$-quasi-Frobenius Lie algebra} for $\frak{g}$ a finite dimensional Lie algebra. The latter consists of a quasi-Frobenius Lie algebra $(\frak{q},\beta)$ together with a left $\frak{g}$-module structure which acts on $\frak{q}$ via derivations and for which $\beta$ is $\frak{g}$-invariant. Geometrically, $\frak{g}$-quasi-Frobenius Lie algebras are the Lie algebra structures associated to symplectic Lie groups with an action by a Lie group $G$ which acts via symplectic Lie group automorphisms. In addition to geometry, $\frak{g}$-quasi-Frobenius Lie algebras can also be motivated from the point of view of category theory. Specifically, $\frak{g}$-quasi Frobenius Lie algebras correspond to \textit{quasi Frobenius Lie objects} in $\mathbf{Rep}(\frak{g})$. If $\frak{g}$ is now equipped with a Lie bialgebra structure, then the categorical formulation of $\overline{G}$-Frobenius algebras given in \cite{KP} suggests that the Lie version of a $\overline{G}$-Frobenius algebra is a quasi-Frobenius Lie object in $\mathbf{Rep}(D(\frak{g}))$, where $D(\frak{g})$ is the associated (semiclassical) Drinfeld double. We show that if $\frak{g}$ is a quasitriangular Lie bialgebra, then every $\frak{g}$-quasi-Frobenius Lie algebra has an induced $D(\frak{g})$-action which gives it the structure of a $D(\frak{g})$-quasi-Frobenius Lie algebra. ;"Differential Geometry (math.DG); Quantum Algebra (math.QA)"

For the triple $(\Sp(4),2\Sp(2),4\Sp(1))$, we find there exists an involution pair of $\sp(4)$ such that $4\sp(1)$ is the fixed point of the pair, and then give the decomposition of $\sp(4)$ as a direct sum of irreducible $\ad(4\sp(1))$-modules. But $\Sp(4)/4\Sp(1)$ is not a generalized Wallach space. Furthermore we give left-invariant Einstein metrics on $\Sp(4)$ which are non-naturally reductive and $\Ad(4\Sp(1))$-invariant. For the general case $(\Sp(2n_1n_2),2\Sp(n_1n_2),2n_2\Sp(n_1))$, there exist $2n_2-1$ involutions of $\sp(2n_1n_2)$ such that $2n_2\sp(n_1))$ is the fixed point of these $2n_2-1$ involutions, and it follows the decomposition of $\sp(2n_1n_2)$ as a direct sum of irreducible $\ad(2n_2\sp(n_1))$-modules.

We apply this to show that the image of Gauss map is preserved under a proper mean curvature flow in euclidean spaces with uniform bounded second fundamental forms. This generalizes the result of Wang \cite{Wang} for compact immersions. We also prove a Omori-Yau maximum principle for properly immersed self-shrinkers, which improves a result in \cite{CJQ}. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)

Spectral data for such solutions are defined for periodic Cauchy data on a line (following Hitchin and Bobenko) and the space of spectral data is described by an asymptotic characterization. Using methods of asymptotic estimates, the inverse problem for the spectral data of such Cauchy data is answered. Finally a Jacobi variety for the spectral curve is constructed, and this is used to study the asymptotic behavior of the spectral data corresponding to actual simply periodic solutions of the sinh-Gordon equation on strips of positive height. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)

Framed loop space is shown to be an infinite-dimensional K\""{a}hler manifold by identifying it with a complex Grassmannian. We show that the space of isometrically immersed loops studied by Millson and Zombro is realized as the symplectic reduction of $\mathcal{M}$ by the action of the based loop group of the circle, giving a smooth version of a result of Hausmann and Knutson on polygon space. The identification with a Grassmannian allows us to describe the geodesics of $\mathcal{M}$ explicitly. Using this description, we show that $\mathcal{M}$ and its quotient by the reparameterization group are nonnegatively curved. We also show that the planar loop space studied by Younes, Michor, Shah and Mumford in the context of computer vision embeds in $\mathcal{M}$ as a totally geodesic, Lagrangian submanifold. The action of the reparameterization group on $\mathcal{M}$ is shown to be Hamiltonian and this is used to characterize the critical points of the weighted total twist functional.

These flows include the inverse mean curvature flow and many nonlinear flows in the literature. We first show that the only compact self-expanders to any of these flows are round spheres. Secondly, we show that complete non-compact self-expanders to any of these flows with asymptotically cylindrical ends must be rotationally symmetric. Thirdly, we show that when such a flow is uniformly parabolic, there exist complete rotationally symmetric self-expanders which are asymptotic to two round cylinders with different radii. These extend some earlier results of inverse mean curvature flow to a wider class of flows. ;"Differential Geometry (math.DG); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)"

It is shown that the only Lie group allowing Sasaki structure with a positive definite metric tensor is the Heisenberg group. We find a complete list of the 22 classes of seven-dimensional nilpotent Lie groups which admit pseudo-Sasaki structure. We also present a list of 25 classes of seven-dimensional nilpotent Lie groups admitting a $K$-contact structure, but not the pseudo-Sasaki structure. All the contact structures considered are central extensions of six-dimensional nilpotent symplectic Lie groups and are established formulas that connect the geometrical characteristics of the six-dimensional nilpotent almost pseudo-K\""{a}hler Lie groups and seven-dimensional nilpotent contact Lie groups. It is known that for the six-dimensional nilpotent pseudo-K\""{a}hler Lie groups the Ricci tensor is always zero.

Our result also ensures jet-interpolation of given finite order, and hence, in particular, one may in addition prescribe the values of the generalized Gauss map. Furthermore, the interpolating immersions can be chosen to be complete, proper into $\mathbb{R}^n$ if the prescription of values is proper, and one-to-one if $n\ge 5$ and the prescription of values is one-to-one. We may also prescribe the flux map of the examples.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04930;Exterior Differential Systems, from Elementary to Advanced; Abraham D. Smith;  This monograph was developed to support a series of lectures at the Institute of Mathematics at the Polish Academy of Sciences in September 2016, as part of a Workshop on the Geometry of Lagrangian Grassmannians and Nonlinear PDEs. The goal is to cut the shortest-possible expository path from the common, elementary concepts of geometry (linear algebra, vector bundles, and algebraic ideals) to the advanced theorems about the characteristic variety. Hopefully, these lectures lower the barrier to advanced topics in exterior differential systems by exposing the audience to elementary versions of several key results regarding the characteristic variety, and to outline how these results could be used to push the frontiers of the subject. These key results are: 1) The incidence correspondence of the characteristic variety, 2) Guillemin normal form and Quillen's thesis, 3) The Integrability of Characteristics (Guillemin, Quillen, Sternberg, Gabber), 4) Yang's Hyperbolicity Criterion. \end{enumerate} To accomplish this, the subject of exterior differential systems is reinterpreted as the study of smooth sub-bundles of the Grassmann bundle over a smooth manifold. These notes intentionally obscure the role of exterior differential forms in computation, instead focusing on tableaux as subspaces of homomorphisms and on symbols as varieties of endomorphisms. Techniques involving differential ideals or PDE analysis are hardly mentioned. Instead, Guillemin normal form (a generalization of Jordan decomposition from a single endomorphism to a variety of endomorphisms) is the primary computational tool. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04988;Diffeological Levi-Civita connections; Ekaterina Pervova;"  A diffeological connection on a diffeological vector pseudo-bundle is defined just the usual one on a smooth vector bundle; this is possible to do, because there is a standard diffeological counterpart of the cotangent bundle. On the other hand, there is not yet a standard theory of tangent bundles, although there are many suggested and promising versions, such as that of the internal tangent bundle, so the abstract notion of a connection on a diffeological vector pseudo-bundle does not automatically provide a counterpart notion for Levi-Civita connections. In this paper we consider the dual of the just-mentioned counterpart of the cotangent bundle in place of the tangent bundle (without making any claim about its geometrical meaning). To it, the notions of compatibility with a pseudo-metric and symmetricity can be easily extended, and therefore the notion of a Levi-Civita connection makes sense as well. In the case when $\Lambda^1(X)$, the counterpart of the cotangent bundle, is finite-dimensional, there is an equivalent Levi-Civita connection on it as well. ";Differential Geometry (math.DG)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04998;On the geometry of semiclassical limits on Dirichlet spaces; Batu Güneysu;"  This paper is a contribution to semiclassical analysis for abstract Schr\""odinger type operators on locally compact spaces: Let $X$ be a metrizable seperable locally compact space, let $\mu$ be a Radon measure on $X$ with a full support. Let $(t,x,y)\mapsto p(t,x,y)$ be a strictly positive pointwise consistent $\mu$-heat kernel, and assume that the generator $H_p\geq 0$ of the corresponding self-adjoint contraction semigroup in $L^2(X,\mu)$ induces a regular Dirichlet form. Then, given a function $\Psi : (0,1)\to (0,\infty)$ such that the limit $\lim_{t\to 0+}p(t,x,x)\Psi (t)$ exists for all $x\in X$, we prove that for every potential $w:X\to \mathbb{R}$ one has $$ \lim_{t \to 0+} \Psi (t)\mathrm{tr}\big(\mathrm{e}^{ -t H_p + w}\big)= \int \mathrm{e}^{-w(x) }\lim_{t \to 0+}p(t,x,x) \Psi (t) d\mu(x)<\infty $$ for the Schr\""odinger type operator $H_p + w$, provided $w$ satisfies very mild conditions at $\infty$, that are essentially only made to guarantee that the sum of quadratic forms $ H_p + w/t$ is self-adjoint and bounded from below for small $t$, and to guarantee that $$ \int \mathrm{e}^{-w(x) }\lim_{t\to 0+}p(t,x,x) \Psi (t) d\mu(x)<\infty. $$ The proof is probabilistic and relies on a principle of not feeling the boundary for $p(t,x,x)$. In particular, this result implies a new semiclassical limit result for partition functions valid on arbitrary connected geodesically complete Riemannian manifolds, and one also recovers a previously established semiclassical limit result for possibly locally infinite connected weighted graphs.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.05372;Sharp one-sided curvature estimates for mean curvature flow and  applications; Mat Langford;  We prove a sharp pinching estimate for immersed mean convex solutions of mean curvature flow which unifies and improves all previously known pinching estimates, including the umbilic estimate of Huisken, the convexity estimates of Huisken--Sinestrari and the cylindrical estimate of Huisken--Sinestrari. Namely, we show that the curvature of the solution pinches onto the convex cone generated by the curvatures of any shrinking cylinder solutions admitted by the initial data. For example, if the initial data is $(m+1)$-convex, then the curvature of the solution pinches onto the convex hull of the curvatures of the shrinking cylinders $\mathbb{R}^m\times S^{n-m}_{\sqrt{2(n-m)(1-t)}}$, $t<1$. In particular, this yields a sharp estimate for the largest principal curvature, which we use to obtain a new proof of a sharp estimate for the inscribed curvature for embedded solutions. Making use of a recent idea of Huisken--Sinestrari, we then obtain a series of sharp estimates for ancient solutions. In particular, we obtain a convexity estimate for ancient solutions which allows us to improve recent characterizations of the shrinking sphere due to Huisken--Sinestrari and Haslhofer--Hershkovitz. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.05658;Minimal surfaces in the 3-sphere by desingularizing intersecting  Clifford tori; Nikolaos Kapouleas,  David Wiygul;  For each integer $k \geq 2$, we apply gluing methods to construct sequences of minimal surfaces embedded in the round $3$-sphere. We produce two types of sequences, all desingularizing collections of intersecting Clifford tori. Sequences of the first type converge to a collection of $k$ Clifford tori intersecting with maximal symmetry along these two circles. Near each of the circles, after rescaling, the sequences converge smoothly on compact subsets to a Karcher-Scherk tower of order $k$. Sequences of the second type desingularize a collection of the same $k$ Clifford tori supplemented by an additional Clifford torus equidistant from the original two circles of intersection, so that the latter torus orthogonally intersects each of the former $k$ tori along a pair of disjoint orthogonal circles, near which the corresponding rescaled sequences converge to a singly periodic Scherk surface. The simpler examples of the first type resemble surfaces constructed by Choe and Soret \cite{CS} by different methods where the number of handles desingularizing each circle is the same. There is a plethora of new examples which are more complicated and on which the number of handles for the two circles differs. Examples of the second type are new as well. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)

In the reversible case, these inequalities were obtained by Cavalletti--Mondino in the framework of curvature-dimension condition by means of the localization method. We show that the same (sharp) estimates hold also for non-reversible metrics. ;"Differential Geometry (math.DG); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.05919;Fractional Yamabe problem on locally flat conformal infinities of  Poincare-Einstein manifolds; Martin Mayer,  Cheikh Birahim Ndiaye;  We study, in this paper, the fractional Yamabe problem introduced by Gonzalez-Qing on the conformal infinity (M^n, [h]) of a Poincare-Einstein manifold (X^{n+1}, g^{+}) with either n=2 or n> 3 and (M^n, [h]) is locally flat - namely (M, h) is locally conformally flat. However, as for the classical Yamabe problem, because of the involved quantization phenomena, the variational analysis of the fractional one exhibits also a local situation and a global one. Furthermore the latter global situation includes the case of conformal infinites of Poincare-Einstein manifolds of dimension either 2 or of dimension greater than 2 and which are locally flat. Hence the minimizing technique of Aubin-Schoen in that case clearly requires an analogue of the Positive Mass theorem of Schoen-Yau, which is not known to hold. Using the works of Caffarelli-Sylvestre, Chang-Gonzalez, Gonzalez-Qing and new, sharp estimates of the Caffarelli-Sylvestre extension of the fractional standard bubbles, which are derived via a suitable interaction interpretation of them rather than Fourier transform, combined with the algebraic topological argument of Bahri-Coron, we bypass the latter Positive Mass issue and show that any conformal infinity of a Poincar\'e-Einstein manifold of dimension either n=2 or of dimension n>2 and which is locally flat admits a Riemannian metric of constant fractional scalar curvature. As a byproduct of our arguments we derive new sharp expansions of the involved Poisson kernel and Green's functions near their singularities, hence answering the first part of the conjecture of Kim-Musso-Wei. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)

Moreover, it is proved that this metric is Roter type, 2-quasi-Einstein, Ricci tensor is Riemann compatible and its Weyl conformal curvature 2-forms are recurrent. It is also shown that the energy momentum tensor of the metric is pseudosymmetric and the conditions under which such tensor is of Codazzi type and cyclic parallel have been investigated. Finally, we have made a comparison between the curvature properties of Robinson-Trautman metric and Som-Raychaudhuri metric. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)

Precisely, we determine the smallest possible value for the index min(p,q) of the metric. When the index is optimal and G non-exceptional, we prove that the metric must be conformally flat, confirming the idea that in a ""good"" dynamical context, a geometry is determined by its automorphisms group. This completes anterior investigations on pseudo-Riemannian conformal actions of semi-simple Lie groups of maximal real-rank. Combined with these results, we obtain as corollary the list of semi-simple Lie groups without compact factor that can act on compact Lorentzian manifolds. We also derive consequences in CR geometry via the Fefferman fibration. ";Differential Geometry (math.DG)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06515;A characterization of codimension one collapse under bounded curvature  and diameter; Saskia Roos;  Let $\mathcal{M}(n,D)$ be the space of closed $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifolds $(M,g)$ with $diam(M) \leq D$ and $| \sec^M | \leq 1$. In this paper we consider sequences $(M_i,g_i)$ in $\mathcal{M}(n,D)$ converging in the Gromov-Hausdorff topology to a compact metric space $Y$. We show on the one hand that the limit space of this sequence has at most codimension $1$ if there is a positive number $r$ such that the quotient $\frac{vol(B^{M_i}_r(x))}{inj^{M_i}(x)}$ can be uniformly bounded from below by a positive constant $C(n,r,Y)$ for all points $x \in M_i$. On the other hand, we show that if the limit space has at most codimension $1$ then for all positive $r$ there is a positive constant $C(n,r,Y)$ bounding the quotient $\frac{vol(B^{M_i}_r(x))}{inj^{M_i}(x)}$ uniformly from below for all $x \in M_i$. The proof uses results about the structure of collapse in $\mathcal{M}(n,D)$ by Cheeger, Fukaya and Gromov. In addition, we derive, for a submersion $M \rightarrow Y$ with uniformly bounded fundamental tensors, an upper bound on the injectivity radius of the fiber $F_p$, with $p \in Y$, which is proportional to the injectivity radius of $M$ at some $x \in F_p$, if the injectivity at $x$ is sufficiently small relative to the injectivity radius of $Y$. As a conclusion, we derive a uniform lower bound on the volume and a bound on the essential supremum of the sectional curvature for the closure of the space consisting of all manifolds in $\mathcal{M}(n,D)$ with $C \leq \min_{x \in M}\frac{vol(B^{M}_r(x))}{inj^{M}(x)}$ for fixed positive numbers $r$ and $C$. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)

This result also yields the upper bound $\mu_2(B(p,R)) \leq 2(\frac{\pi}{2 R})^2$ on the first nonzero Neumann eigenvalue $\mu_2$ of the Laplacian in terms only of the radius. This has also been conjectured for $R$ up to half the injectivity radius. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)

A more specific aim is to describe a procedure for gluing together two usual Dirac operators and to explain in what sense the result is again a Dirac operator. Since versions of cut-and-paste (surgery) operations have already appeared in the context of Atiyah-Singer theory, we specify that our gluing procedure is designed to lead to spaces that are not smooth manifolds in any ordinary sense, and since much attention has been paid in recent years to Dirac operators on spaces with singularities, we also specify that our approach is more of a piecewise-linear nature (although, hopefully, singular spaces in a more analytic sense will enter the picture sooner or later; but this work is not yet about them). Most of it is devoted to the diffeological versions of the components that go into the standard definition of a Dirac operator as the composition of a Clifford connection with Clifford action by sections of the cotangent bundle; a diffeological Dirac operator is then standardly defined.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06919;Classification of digital affine noncommutative geometries; Shahn Majid,  Anna Pachol;  It is known that connected translation invariant $n$-dimensional noncommutative differentials $d x^i$ on the algebra $k[x^1,\cdots,x^n]$ of polynomials in $n$-variables over a field $k$ are classified by commutative algebras $V$ on the vector space spanned by the coordinates. This data also applies to construct differentials on the Heisenberg algebra `spacetime' with relations $[x^\mu,x^\nu]=\lambda\Theta^{\mu\nu}$ where $ \Theta$ is an antisymmetric matrix as well as to Lie algebras with pre-Lie algebra structures. We specialise the general theory to the field $k={\ \mathbb{F}}_2$ of two elements, in which case translation invariant metrics (i.e. with constant coefficients) are equivalent to making $V$ a Frobenius algebras. We classify all of these and their quantum Levi-Civita bimodule connections for $n=2,3$, with partial results for $n=4$. For $n=2$ we find 3 inequivalent differential structures admitting 1,2 and 3 invariant metrics respectively. For $n=3$ we find 6 differential structures admitting $0,1,2,3,4,7$ invariant metrics respectively. We give some examples for $n=4$ and general $n$. Surprisingly, not all our geometries for $n\ge 2$ have zero quantum Riemann curvature. Quantum gravity is normally seen as a weighted `sum' over all possible metrics but our results are a step towards a deeper approach in which we must also `sum' over differential structures. Over ${\mathbb{F}}_2$ we construct some of our algebras and associated structures by digital gates, opening up the possibility of `digital geometry'. ;"Differential Geometry (math.DG); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Quantum Algebra (math.QA)"

Let $G$ be the group of isometries of $C\ell(V,Q)$ relative to $\bar{Q}$, and let $LG$ be the Lie algebra of infinitesimal isometries of $C\ell(V,Q)$ relative to $\bar{Q}$. We derive some basic structural information about $LG$, and we compute $G$ in the case that $F = R, V = R^{n}$ and $Q$ is positive definite on $R^{n}$. In a sequel to this paper we determine $LG$ in the case that $F = R, V = R^{n}$ and $Q$ is nondegenerate on $R^{n}$. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)

Let ${e_{1}, ... , e_{n}}$ denote the canonical basis of $F^{n}$. Let r and s be nonnegative integers such that r + s = n, and let Q denote the nondegenerate bilinear form on $F^{n}$ such that $Q(e_{i}, e_{j}) = 0$ if i,j are distinct, $Q(e_{i},e_{i}) = 1$ if $1 \leq i \leq r$ and $Q(e_{r+j},e_{r+j}) = -1$ if $1 \leq j \leq s$. Let $C\ell(r,s)$ denote the Clifford algebra determined by Q and $F^{n}$. There is a canonical extension of Q to a nondegenerate, symmetric, bilinear form $\bar{Q}$ on $C\ell(r,s)$. An element g of $C\ell(r,s)$ will be called an isometry of $C\ell(r,s)$ if left and right translations by g preserve $\bar{Q}$. Let $G_{r,s}$ denote the group of all isometries of $C\ell(r,s)$. We construct a Lie algebra $LG_{r,s}$ over F that equals the Lie algebra of $G_{r,s}$ in the case that F = R or C. The Lie algebra $LG_{r,s}$ admits an involutive automorphism whose +1 and -1 eigenspaces determine a Cartan decomposition $LG_{r,s} = K_{r,s} \oplus P_{r,s}$. We compute the bracket relations for a natural system of generators of $LG_{r,s}$. Finally, we determine $LG_{r,s}$ in the case that F = R. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07882;A class of cubic hypersurfaces and quaternionic Kähler manifolds of  co-homogeneity one; Vicente Cortés,  Malte Dyckmanns,  Michel Jüngling,  David Lindemann;"  We classify all complete projective special real manifolds with reducible cubic potential, obtaining four series. For two of the series the manifolds are homogeneous, for the two others the automorphism group acts with co-homogeneity one. We show that, for each dimension $n\geq 3$, each of the two homogeneous examples can be deformed by a family depending on $n-2$ parameters of complete projective special real manifolds that are pairwise inequivalent. The two homogeneous examples are the boundary points of a curve which lies in the union of the two families. Complete projective special real manifolds give rise to complete quaternionic K\""ahler manifolds via the supergravity q-map which is the composition of the supergravity c-map and r-map. We develop curvature formulas for manifolds in the image of the q-map. Applying the q-map to one of the above series of projective special real manifolds we obtain a series of complete quaternionic K\""ahler manifolds, which are shown to be inhomogeneous (of co-homogeneity one) based on our curvature formulas.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07938;Geometric interpretation of generalized distance-squared mappings of  $\mathbb{R}^2$ into $\mathbb{R}^\ell$ $(\ell \geq 3)$; Shunsuke Ichiki;  Generalized distance-squared mappings are quadratic mappings of $\mathbb{R}^m$ into $\mathbb{R}^\ell$ of special type. In the case that matrices $A$ constructed by coefficients of generalized distance-squared mappings of $\mathbb{R}^2$ into $\mathbb{R}^\ell$ ($\ell \geq3$) are full rank, the generalized distance-squared mappings having a generic central point have the following properties. In the case of $\ell=3$, they have only one singular point. On the other hand, in the case of $\ell>3$, they have no singular points. Hence, in this paper, the reason why in the case of $\ell=3$ (resp., in the case of $\ell>3$), they have only one singular point (resp., no singular points) is explained by giving a geometric interpretation to these phenomena. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07942;Seiberg-Witten monopoles with multiple spinors on a surface times a  circle; Aleksander Doan;  The Seiberg-Witten equations with multiple spinors on a compact 3-manifold $Y$ generalise the classical Seiberg-Witten equations. In contrast to the classical case, the moduli space of solutions $\mathcal{M}$ can be non-compact due to the appearance of so-called Fueter sections. In the absence of Fueter sections we show how to count points in $\mathcal{M}$ with signs, mimicking the definition of the Seiberg-Witten invariant. We then specialise to the case when $Y = S^1 \times \Sigma$, where $\Sigma$ is a Riemann surface. In this setting $\mathcal{M}$ is described in terms of holomorphic data over $\Sigma$. We define natural analytic and algebro-geometric compactifications of $\mathcal{M}$, and construct a homeomorphism between them. Next we prove that for a generic choice of circle-invariant parameters of the equations, Fueter sections do not appear and $\mathcal{M}$ is a compact Kahler manifold. After a small perturbation it splits into isolated points which can be counted with signs, yielding a number independent of the initial choice of the parameters. We compute this number for surfaces of low genus. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)

Let $\Pi$ be the associated generalized Weyl group. We study the properties of the lifting action $G$ on the cotangent bundle $T^*M$. In particular, we show that the restriction map $(C^{\infty}(T^*M))^G \rightarrow (C^{\infty}(T^* \Sigma))^{\Pi}$ is a surjective homomorphism of Poisson algebras. As a corollary, the singular symplectic reductions $T^*M // G $ and $T^* \Sigma // \Pi$ are isomorphic as stratified symplectic spaces, which gives a partial answer to a conjecture of Lerman, Montgomery and Sjamaar. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08004;Local isometric immersions of pseudo-spherical surfaces and k-th order  evolution equations; Nabil Kahouadji,  Niky Kamran,  Keti Tenenblat;  We consider the class of evolution equations that describe pseudo-spherical surfaces of the form u\_t = F (u, $\partial$u/$\partial$x, ..., $\partial$^k u/$\partial$x^k), k $\ge$ 2 classified by Chern-Tenenblat. This class of equations is characterized by the property that to each solution of a differential equation within this class, there corresponds a 2-dimensional Riemannian metric of curvature-1. We investigate the following problem: given such a metric, is there a local isometric immersion in R 3 such that the coefficients of the second fundamental form of the surface depend on a jet of finite order of u? By extending our previous result for second order evolution equation to k-th order equations, we prove that there is only one type of equations that admit such an isometric immersion. We prove that the coefficients of the second fundamental forms of the local isometric immersion determined by the solutions u are universal, i.e., they are independent of u. Moreover, we show that there exists a foliation of the domain of the parameters of the surface by straight lines with the property that the mean curvature of the surface is constant along the images of these straight lines under the isometric immersion. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08188;A construction of hyperkähler metrics through Riemann-Hilbert problems  I; César Garza;"  In 2009 Gaiotto, Moore and Neitzke presented a new construction of hyperk\""{a}hler metrics on the total spaces of certain complex integrable systems, represented as a torus fibration $\mathcal{M}$ over a base space $\mathcal{B}$, except for a divisor $D$ in $\mathcal{B}$, in which the torus fiber degenerates into a nodal torus. The hyperk\""{a}hler metric $g$ is obtained via solutions $\mathcal{X}_\gamma$ of a Riemann-Hilbert problem. We interpret the Kontsevich-Soibelman Wall Crossing Formula as an isomonodromic deformation of a family of RH problems, therefore guaranteeing continuity of $\mathcal{X}_\gamma$ at the walls of marginal stability. The technical details about solving the different classes of Riemann-Hilbert problems that arise here are left to a second article. To extend this construction to singular fibers, we use the Ooguri-Vafa case as our model and choose a suitable gauge transformation that allow us to define an integral equation defined at the degenerate fiber, whose solutions are the desired Darboux coordinates $\mathcal{X}_\gamma$. We show that these functions yield a holomorphic symplectic form $\varpi(\zeta)$, which, by Hitchin's twistor construction, constructs the desired hyperk\""{a}hler metric.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08238;Circle actions on almost complex manifolds with 4 fixed points; Donghoon Jang;"  Let the circle act on a compact almost complex manifold $M$. In this paper, we classify the fixed point data of the action if there are 4 fixed points and the dimension of the manifold is at most 6. First, if $\dim M=2$, then $M$ is a disjoint union of rotations on two 2-spheres. Second, if $\dim M=4$, we prove that the action alikes a circle action on a Hirzebruch surface. Finally, if $\dim M=6$, we prove that six types occur for the fixed point data; $\mathbb{CP}^3$ type, complex quadric in $\mathbb{CP}^4$ type, Fano 3-fold type, $S^6 \cup S^6$ type, and two unknown types that might possibly be realized as blow ups of a manifold like $S^6$. When $\dim M=6$, we recover the result by Ahara in which the fixed point data is determined if furthermore $\mathrm{Todd}(M)=1$ and $c_1^3(M)[M] \neq 0$, and the result by Tolman in which the fixed point data is determined if furthermore the base manifold admits a symplectic structure and the action is Hamiltonian.

For compact groups and manifolds, this reduces to the Atiyah-Segal-Singer fixed point formula. Other special cases include an index theorem by Connes and Moscovici for homogeneous spaces, and an earlier index theorem by the second author, both in cases where the group acting is connected and semisimple. As an application of this fixed point formula, we give a new proof of Harish-Chandra's character formula for discrete series representations. ;"Differential Geometry (math.DG); K-Theory and Homology (math.KT); Operator Algebras (math.OA); Representation Theory (math.RT)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08892;Asymptotic rigidity of Riemannian manifolds; Raz Kupferman,  Cy Maor,  Asaf Shachar;"  Let $f: M \to N$ be a Lipschitz map between two oriented Riemannian manifolds, whose differential is almost everywhere a linear isometry. Gromov (1986) showed that if $f$ is not assumed to be smooth, then it is not necessarily an isometric immersion; moreover, $M$ may not even be isometrically immersible in $N$. In this paper we prove that if $f$ is additionally orientation-preserving (almost everywhere), then it is an isometric immersion. Moreover, we prove that if there exists a sequence of mapping $f_n : (M,h) \to (N,h)$, whose differentials converge in $L^p$ to the set of orientation-preserving isometries, then there exists a subsequence converging to an isometric immersion. These results are generalizations of celebrated rigidity theorems by Liouville (1850) and Reshetnyak (1967) from Euclidean to Riemannian settings. We describe an application of the generalized rigidity theorem to convergence notions of manifolds. ";"Differential Geometry (math.DG); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)"

Moreover, we motivate that these are suitable generalizations of cross ratios on ideal boundaries of rank one symmetric spaces, by proving that every continuous cross ratio-preserving map on the maximal Furstenberg boundary (or full flag manifold) is induced by an isometry, after multiplying metrics on de Rham factors by positive constants. If the symmetric space is irreducible this yields a one-to-one correspondence of isometries and continuous cross ratio-preserving maps. ";"Differential Geometry (math.DG); Group Theory (math.GR)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00580;Evolving to Non-round Weingarten Spheres: Integer Linear Hopf Flows; Brendan Guilfoyle,  Wilhelm Klingenberg;  In the 1950's Hopf gave examples of non-round convex 2-spheres in Euclidean 3-space with rotational symmetry that satisfy a linear relationship between their principal curvatures. In this paper we investigate conditions under which evolving a smooth rotationally symmetric sphere by a linear combination of its radii of curvature yields a Hopf sphere. When the coefficients of the flow have certain integer values, the fate of an initial sphere is entirely determined by the local geometry of its isolated umbilic points. A surprising variety of behaviours is uncovered: convergence to round spheres and non-round Hopf spheres, as well as divergence to infinity. The critical quantity is the rate of vanishing of the astigmatism - the difference of the radii of curvature - at the isolated umbilic points. It is proven that the size of this quantity versus the coefficient in the flow function determines the fate of the evolution. The geometric setting for the equation is Radius of Curvature space, viewed as a pair of hyperbolic/AdS half-planes joined along their boundary, the umbilic horizon. A rotationally symmetric sphere determines a parameterized curve in this plane with end-points on the umbilic horizon. The slope of the curve at the umbilic horizon is linked by the Codazzi-Mainardi equations to the rate of vanishing of astigmatism, and for generic initial conditions can be used to determine the outcome of the flow. The slope can jump during the flow, and a number of examples are given: instant jumps of the initial slope, as well as umbilic circles that contract to points in finite time and 'pop' the slope. Finally, we present soliton-like solutions: curves that evolve under linear flows by mutual hyperbolic/AdS isometries (dilation and translation) of Radius of Curvature space. A forthcoming paper will apply these geometric ideas to non-linear curvature flows. ;"Differential Geometry (math.DG); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)"

Cartan with the upshot that generic equations in a C-class can be solved without integration. While Cartan's definition was in terms of differential invariants being first integrals, all results exhibiting C-classes that we are aware of are based on the fact that a canonical Cartan geometry associated to the equations in the class descends to the space of solutions. For sufficiently low orders, these geometries belong to the class of parabolic geometries and the results follow from the general characterization of geometries descending to a twistor space. In this article we answer the question of whether a canonical Cartan geometry descends to the space of solutions in the case of scalar ODEs of order at least four and of systems of ODEs of order at least three. As in the lower order cases, this is characterized by the vanishing of the generalized Wilczynski invariants, which are defined via the linearization at a solution. The canonical Cartan geometries (which are not parabolic geometries) are a slight variation of those available in the literature based on a recent general construction. All the verifications needed to apply this construction for the classes of ODEs we study are carried out in the article, which thus also provides a complete alternative proof for the existence of canonical Cartan connections associated to higher order (systems of) ODEs. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)

We endow the surface with a useful Riemannian metric which is closely related to normal curvature, and from this we re-calculate the Minkowski Gaussian and mean curvatures. These curvatures are also re-obtained in terms of ambient affine distance functions, and as a consequence we characterize minimal surfaces as the solutions of a certain differential equation. We also investigate in which cases it is possible that the affine normal and the Birkhoff normal vector fields of an immersion coincide, proving that this only happens when the geometry is Euclidean. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)

With these concepts in mind, various questions immediately appear. The aim of this paper is to propose and answer some of those questions. In this framework we prove several characterizations of minimal surfaces, and analogues of some global theorems (e.g., Hadamard-type theorems) are also derived. A result on the curvature of surfaces of constant Minkowski width is also given. Finally, we study the ambient metric induced on the surface, proving an extension of the classical Bonnet theorem. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)

In particular, this result provides a criterion for the absolutely continuous spectra of $-\Delta_g$ and $-\Delta_h$ to coincide. Our proof relies on estimates that are obtained using a probabilistic Bismut type formula for the gradient of a heat semigroup. Unlike all previous results, our integral criterion only requires some lower control on the Ricci curvatures and some upper control on the heat kernels, but no control at all on the injectivity radii. As a consequence, we obtain a stability result for the absolutely continuous spectrum under a Ricci flow. ;"Differential Geometry (math.DG); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Spectral Theory (math.SP)"

If $p$ is a point on a stationary $n$-rectifiable set $\Sigma \subset \R^m$ with boundary $\Gamma$, then we show the density of $\Sigma$ at $p$ is $\leq$ the density at its vertex $p$ of the cone over $\Gamma$. It follows that if $\Pi_p(\Gamma)$ is less than twice the volume of $S^{n-1}$, for all $p \in \Gamma$, then $\Sigma$ is an embedded submanifold. As a consequence, we prove that given two $n$-planes $R^n_1, R^n_2$ in $\R^m$ and two compact convex hypersurfaces $\Gamma_i$ of $R^n_i, i=1,2$, a nonflat minimal submanifold spanned by $\Gamma:=\Gamma_1\cup\Gamma_2$ is embedded. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02382;An Approach to Differential Invariants of $G$-Structures; Ignacio Sánchez-Rodríguez;"  In a natural way, the local diffeomorphisms of a manifold onto itself act on the reference frame bundles of any order and on the bundles associated with them. Due to the transitivity, the invariants by diffeomorphisms of an associated bundle correspond to the real functions on the orbit space of the action of the jet group on the typical fiber, which enables to construct the said associated bundle. Scalar differential invariants are functions on bundles of jets of sections of associated bundles, which are invariant by the standard action of local diffeomorphisms. We show that these jet bundles are, in turn, associated bundles with reference frame bundles of higher order. By the previous result, this will allow to recognize scalar differential invariants as real functions over a quotient space, regardless of the base manifold. We apply the above to $G$-structures, and describe their scalar differential invariants as functions over certain quotient spaces. Each quotient space contains a dense differentiable manifold, whose dimension is ""the number of functionally independent scalar differential invariants"". We will obtain a lower bound of that number and calculate it for some cases, in particular for the scalar conformal differential invariants. ";Differential Geometry (math.DG)

It is natural to ask when a compact Hermitian manifold could admit a flat $s$-Gauduchon connection. This is related to a question asked by Yau \cite{Yau}. The cases with $s=0$ (a flat Chern connection) or $s=2$ (a flat Bismut connection) are classified respectively by Boothby \cite{Boothby} in the 1950s or by Q.

Very recent work by Dumas and Neitzke indicates that the convergence rate for the metric is exponential, at least in certain directions. ;"Differential Geometry (math.DG); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03447;Geometric rigidity of constant heat flow; Alessandro Savo;  Let $\Omega$ be a compact Riemannian manifold with smooth boundary and let $u_t$ be the solution of the heat equation on $\Omega$, having constant unit initial data $u_0=1$ and Dirichlet boundary conditions ($u_t=0$ on the boundary, at all times). If at every time $t$ the normal derivative of $u_t$ is a constant function on the boundary, we say that $\Omega$ has the {\it constant flow property}. This gives rise to an overdetermined parabolic problem, and our aim is to classify the manifolds having this property. In fact, if the metric is analytic, we prove that $\Omega$ has the constant flow property if and only if it is an {\it isoparametric tube}, that is, it is a solid tube of constant radius around a closed, smooth, minimal submanifold, with the additional property that all equidistants to the boundary (parallel hypersurfaces) are smooth and have constant mean curvature. Hence, the constant flow property can be viewed as an analytic counterpart to the isoparametric property. Finally, we relate the constant flow property with other overdetermined problems, in particular, the well-known Serrin problem on the mean-exit time function, and discuss a counterexample involving minimal free boundary immersions into Euclidean balls. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)

The new technical ingredient is the Feynman-Kac formula for differential forms satisfying absolute boundary conditions proved in \cite{dL}. Combined with the so-called supersymmetric aproach to index theory, this leads to a path integral representation of the Euler characteristic of the manifold in terms of normally reflected Brownian motion whose short time asymptotics clarifies the role played by the shape operator in determining the boundary contribution to the formula. As a consequence we obtain the expected {\em local} Gauss-Bonnet formula which upon integration yields the desired global result. ;"Differential Geometry (math.DG); Probability (math.PR)"

For a weighted Riemannian manifold, Cheng--Zhou showed that the sharp spectral gap is achieved only when a $1$-dimensional Gaussian space is split off. This can be regarded as an infinite-dimensional counterpart to Obata's rigidity theorem. Generalizing to $RCD(K,\infty)$-spaces is not straightforward due to the lack of smooth structure and doubling condition. We employ the lift of an eigenfunction to the Wasserstein space and the theory of regular Lagrangian flows recently developed by Ambrosio--Trevisan to overcome this difficulty. ;"Differential Geometry (math.DG); Metric Geometry (math.MG)"

We want to present in this paper a mathematical structure generalizing the fiber bundle structure to the case of a product fiber of the form $F=S \times W$, that enable the possible definition of multiple naturally defined fibers at each point of the manifold, on which therefore one can define objects that depend only on one of the components of the global fiber.

Also this geometry was a starting point for the second author's new approach to a geometric unification of General Relativity and Quantum Physics ( see [23]).

https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04525;Partial Regularity for a Nonlinear Sigma Model with Gravitino in Higher  Dimensions; Jürgen Jost,  Ruijun Wu,  Miaomiao Zhu;  We study the regularity problem of the nonlinear sigma model with gravitino fields in higher dimensions. After setting up the geometric model, we derive the Euler--Lagrange equations and consider the regularity of weak solutions defined in suitable Sobolev spaces. We show that any weak solution is actually smooth under some smallness assumption for certain Morrey norms. By assuming some higher integrability of the vector spinor, we can show a partial regularity result for stationary solutions, provided the gravitino is critical, which means that the corresponding supercurrent vanishes. Moreover, in dimension less than 6, partial regularity holds for stationary solutions with respect to general gravitino fields. ;"Differential Geometry (math.DG); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04528;Coordinates Adapted to Vector Fields I: Canonical Coordinates; Betsy Stovall,  Brian Street;"  Given a finite collection of $C^1$ vector fields on a $C^2$ manifold which span the tangent space at every point, we consider the question of when there is locally a coordinate system in which these vector fields have a higher level of smoothness. For example, when is there a coordinate system in which the vector fields are smooth, or real analytic, or have Zygmund regularity of some finite order? We address this question in a quantitative way, which strengthens and generalizes previous works on the quantitative theory of sub-Riemannian (aka Carnot-Carath\'eodory) geometry due to Nagel, Stein, and Wainger, Tao and Wright, the second author, and others. Furthermore, we provide a diffeomorphism invariant version of these theories. This is the first part in a three part series of papers. In this paper, we study a particular coordinate system adapted to a collection of vector fields (sometimes called canonical coordinates) and present results related to the above questions which are not quite sharp; these results from the backbone of the series. The methods of this paper are based on techniques from ODEs. In the second paper, we use additional methods from PDEs to obtain the sharp results. In the third paper, we prove results concerning real analyticity and use methods from ODEs. ";"Differential Geometry (math.DG); Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA); Metric Geometry (math.MG)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04604;Ricci Almost Solitons on semi-Riemannian Warped Products; Keti Tenenblat,  Valter Borges;  We characterize Ricci almost solitons on semi-Riemannian warped products, considering the potential function to depend on the fiber or not. We show that the fiber is necessarily an Einstein manifold. As a consequence of our characterization we prove that when the potential function depends on the fiber, if the gradient of the warping function does not act by translations then the base and the warped product are also Einstein manifolds. Moreover, we show the existence of conformal vector fields on the base, the fiber and on the warped product. Assuming completeness of the warped product we provide a classification of such manifolds. When the potential function depends on the fiber and the gradient of the warping functions is an improper vector field, we show that the base is a Brinkmann space and the fiber is Ricci flat. We use the characterization also to prove that the potential function of a complete Ricci soliton depends only on the base. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04705;Poisson brackets with prescribed family of functions in involution; Fani Petalidou;  It is well known that functions in involution with respect to Poisson brackets have a privileged role in the theory of completely integrable systems. Finding functionally independent functions in involution with a given function $h$ on a Poisson manifold is a fundamental problem of this theory and is very useful for the explicit integration of the equations of motion defined by $h$. In this paper, we present our results on the study of the inverse, so to speak, problem. By developing a technique analogous to that presented in P. Damianou and F. Petalidou, Poisson brackets with prescribed Casimirs, Canad. J. Math., 2012, vol. 64, 991-1018, for the establishment of Poisson brackets with prescribed Casimir invariants, we construct an algorithm which yields Poisson brackets having a given family of functions in involution. Our approach allows us to deal with bi-Hamiltonian structures constructively and therefore allows us to also deal with the completely integrable systems that arise in such a framework. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04904;Complete non-compact G2-manifolds from asymptotically conical Calabi-Yau  3-folds; Lorenzo Foscolo,  Mark Haskins,  Johannes Nordström;"  We develop a powerful new analytic method to construct complete non-compact G2-manifolds, i.e. Riemannian 7-manifolds (M,g) whose holonomy group is the compact exceptional Lie group G2. Our construction starts with a complete non-compact asymptotically conical Calabi-Yau 3-fold B and a circle bundle M over B satisfying a necessary topological condition. Our method then produces a 1-parameter family of circle-invariant complete G2-metrics on M that collapses to the original Calabi-Yau metric on the base B as the parameter converges to 0. The G2-metrics we construct have controlled asymptotic geometry at infinity, so-called asymptotically locally conical (ALC) metrics, and are the natural higher-dimensional analogues of the ALF metrics that are well known in 4-dimensional hyperk\""ahler geometry. We give two illustrations of the strength of our method. Firstly we use it to construct infinitely many diffeomorphism types of complete non-compact simply connected G2-manifolds; previously only a handful of such diffeomorphism types was known. Secondly we use it to prove the existence of continuous families of complete non-compact G2-metrics of arbitrarily high dimension; previously only rigid or 1-parameter families of complete non-compact G2-metrics were known.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05247;Nontrivial bundles of coadjoint orbits over $S^2$; David Martínez Torres,  Ignasi Mundet i Riera;"  Let $G$ be a compact connected semisimple Lie group with Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. Let $\mathcal{O}\subset\mathfrak{g}^*$ be a coadjoint orbit. The action of $G$ on $\mathcal{O}$ induces a morphism $\rho:G\to \mathrm{Homeo}(\mathcal{O})$. We prove that the induced map $\pi_1(\rho):\pi_1(G)\to\pi_1(\mathrm{Homeo}(\mathcal{O}))$ is injective. This strengthens a theorem of McDuff and Tolman (conjectured by Weinstein in 1989) according to which the analogous map $G\to\mathrm{Ham}(\mathcal{O})$ is injective on fundamental groups, where $\mathrm{Ham}(\mathcal{O})$ is the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of the standard symplectic structure on $\mathcal{O}$. To prove our theorem we associate to every nontrivial element of $\pi_1(G)$ a bundle over $S^2$ with fiber $\mathcal{O}$, using the standard patching construction. We then prove that the resulting bundle is topologically nontrivial by studying its cohomology. For this, we prove that it suffices to consider the case in which $G$ is simple and $\mathcal{O}$ is a minimal orbit, and then we prove our result for simple $G$ and minimal orbit $\mathcal{O}$ in a case by case analysis; the proof for the exceptional groups $E_6$ and $E_7$ relies on computer calculations, while all the other ones are addressed by hand. A basic tool in some of our computations is a generalization of Chevalley's formula to bundles of coadjoint orbits over $S^2$ that we prove in this paper. ";Differential Geometry (math.DG)

But for varieties with an intermidiate Kodaira dimension we can have several different types of canonical metrics. In this paper we introduce a new notion of canonical metric for varieties with an intermidiate Kodaira dimension. We highlight that to get $C^\infty$-solution of CMA equation of relative K\""ahler Einstein metric we need Song-Tian-Tsuji measure (which has minimal singularities with respect to other relative volume forms) be $C^\infty$-smooth and special fiber has canonical singularities. Moreover, we conjecture that if we have relative K\""ahler-Einstein metric then our family is stable in the sense of Alexeev,and Kollar-Shepherd-Barron. By inspiring the work of Greene-Shapere-Vafa-Yau semi-Ricci flat metric, we introduce fiberwise Calabi-Yau foliation which relies in context of generalized notion of foliation. In final, we give Bogomolov-Miyaoka-Yau inequality for minimal varieties with intermediate Kodaira dimensions which admits relative K\""ahler-Einstein metric. ";Differential Geometry (math.DG)

As application we prove an a priori estimate of the geodesic diameter of compact connected smooth immersions in terms of their boundary data and mean curvature. These results are developed in the framework of varifolds. For this purpose, we establish that the notion of indecomposability is the appropriate substitute for connectedness and that it has a strong regularising effect; we thus obtain a new natural class of varifolds to study. Finally, our development leads to a variety of questions that are of substance both in the smooth and the nonsmooth setting.

The main result proved here is a structure theorem for flat holomorphic vector bundles $E_\rho$ associated to any irreducible representation $\rho \,: \,\Gamma \,\longrightarrow\, \text{GL}(d, {\mathbb C})$.

All the rational Chern classes of $E$ vanish, in particular, its degree is zero. We deduce a stability result for flat holomorphic vector bundles $E_{\rho}$ of rank 2 over compact quotients $\text{SL}(2, {\mathbb C}) / \Gamma$.

First we establish the global existence of starshaped entire graphs with superlinear growth at infinity. The main result in this work concerns the critical case of asymptotically conical entire convex graphs. In this case we show that there exists a time $ T < +\infty$, which depends on the growth at infinity of the initial data, such that the unique solution of the flow exists for all $t < T$. Moreover, as $t \to T$ the solution converges to a flat plane. Our techniques exploit the ultra-fast diffusion character of the fully-nonlinear flow, a property that implies that the asymptotic behavior at spatial infinity of our solution plays a crucial influence on the maximal time of existence, as such behavior propagates infinitely fast towards the interior. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)

In particular, such heterotic $G_2$ systems can be rephrased in terms of a differential $\check {\cal D}$ acting on a complex $\check\Omega^*(Y , {\cal Q})$, where ${\cal Q}=T^*Y\oplus{\rm End}(TY)\oplus{\rm End}(V)$ and $\check {\cal D}$ is an appropriate projection of an exterior covariant derivative ${\cal D}$ which satisfies an instanton condition.

We proceed to restrict this system to manifolds $X$ with an $SU(3)$ structure corresponding to supersymmetric compactifications to four dimensional Minkowski space, often referred to as Strominger--Hull solutions. In doing so, we derive a new result: the Strominger-Hull system is equivalent to a particular holomorphic Yang-Mills covariant derivative on ${\cal Q}\vert_X=T^*X\oplus{\rm End}(TX)\oplus{\rm End}(V)$. ;"Differential Geometry (math.DG); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)"

In this paper, we identify another condition that is not only sufficient, but also necessary for such a removability of singularities. This is the validity of the Pohozaev identity. In situations where such an identity fails to hold, we introduce a new quantity, called the {\it Pohozaev constant}, which on one hand measures the extent to which the Pohozaev identity fails and on the other hand provides a characterization of the singular behavior of a solution at an isolated singularity. We apply this to the blow-up analysis for super-Liouville type equations on Riemann surfaces with conical singularities, because in the presence of such singularities, conformal invariance no longer holds and a local singularity is in general non-removable unless the Pohozaev constant is vanishing. ;"Differential Geometry (math.DG); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)"

We consider the issue of describing the set of all maps $F:\Omega\to\mathbb{R}^n$ with the property that each of the given vector fields is an eigenvector of the Jacobian matrix of $F$. By introducing a coordinate independent definition of the Jacobian, we obtain an intrinsic formulation of the problem, which leads to an overdetermined PDE system, whose compatibility conditions can be expressed in an intrinsic, coordinate independent manner. To analyze this system we formulate and prove a generalization of the classical Frobenius integrability theorems. The size and structure of the solution set of this system depends on the properties of the partial frame, in particular, whether or not it is in involution. A particularly nice subclass of involutive partial frames, called rich, can be completely analyzed. Involutive, but non-rich case is somewhat harder to handle. We provide a complete answer in the case of $m=3$ and arbitrary $n$, as well as some general results for arbitrary $m$. The non-involutive case is far more challenging, and we only obtain a comprehensive analysis in the case $n=3$, $m=2$. Finally, we provide explicit examples illustrating the various possibilities. Our initial motivation for considering this problem comes from the geometric study of hyperbolic conservative systems in one spatial dimension. ;"Differential Geometry (math.DG); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.07826;Variational submanifolds of Euclidean spaces; Demeter Krupka,  Zbyněk Urban,  Jana Volná;"  Systems of ordinary differential equations (or dynamical forms in Lagrangian mechanics), induced by embeddings of smooth fibered manifolds over one-dimensional basis, are considered in the class of variational equations. For a given non-variational system, conditions assuring variationality (the Helmholtz conditions) of the induced system with respect to a submanifold of a Euclidean space are studied, and the problem of existence of these ""variational submanifolds"" is formulated in general and solved for second-order systems. The variational sequence theory on sheaves of differential forms is employed as a main tool for analysis of local and global aspects (variationality and variational triviality). The theory is illustrated by examples of holonomic constraints (submanifolds of a configuration Euclidean space) which are variational submanifolds in geometry and mechanics.

Rod Gover;  We establish an algorithm which computes formulae for the CR GJMS operators, the $P^\prime$-operator, and the $Q^\prime$-curvature in terms of CR tractors. When applied to torsion-free pseudo-Einstein contact forms, this algorithm both gives an explicit factorisation of the CR GJMS operators and the $P^\prime$-operator, and shows that the $Q^\prime$-curvature is constant, with the constant explicitly given in terms of the Webster scalar curvature. We also use our algorithm to derive local formulae for the $P^\prime$-operator and $Q^\prime$-curvature of a five-dimensional pseudo-Einstein manifold. Comparison with Marugame's formulation of the Burns--Epstein invariant as the integral of a pseudohermitian invariant yields new insights into the class of local pseudohermitian invariants for which the total integral is independent of the choice of pseudo-Einstein contact form. ;"Differential Geometry (math.DG); Complex Variables (math.CV)"

We endow the valuation space generated by mixed volumes with a norm induced by the positive cone. This enables us to construct a continuous extension of the convolution operator on smooth valuations to the closure of that space. As an application, we prove a variant of Minkowski's existence theorem. Furthermore, given a linear map, we generalize a theorem of Favre-Wulcan and Lin by proving that the eigenvalues of the linear map is related to the spectral radius of the induced linear operator on the space of valuations. Finally, given a linear action and under a natural strict log-concavity assumption on certain spectral radius of the induced linear operators on valuations, we study the positivity properties of the space of invariant valuations corresponding to the spectral radius of the operator. ;"Differential Geometry (math.DG); Dynamical Systems (math.DS); Metric Geometry (math.MG)"

The integral variational functionals for finite dimensional immersed submanifolds are studied by means of the fundamental Lepage equivalent of a homogeneous Lagrangian, which can be regarded as a generalization of the well-known Hilbert form in the classical mechanics. Prolongations of immersions, diffeomorphisms and vector fields to the Grassmann fibrations are introduced as geometric tools for the variations of immersions. The first infinitesimal variation formula together with its consequences, the Euler-Lagrange equations for extremal submanifolds and the Noether theorem for invariant variational functionals are proved.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.08494;A Realization of Thurstons Geometrization: Discrete Ricci Flow with  Surgery; Paul M. Alsing,  Warner A. Miller,  Shing-Tung Yau;  Hamilton's Ricci flow (RF) equations were recently expressed in terms of a sparsely-coupled system of autonomous first-order nonlinear differential equations for the edge lengths of a d-dimensional piecewise linear (PL) simplicial geometry. More recently, this system of discrete Ricci flow (DRF) equations was further simplified by explicitly constructing the Forman-Ricci tensor associated to each edge, thereby diagonalizing the first-order differential operator and avoiding the need to invert large sparse matrices at each time step. We recently showed analytically and numerically that these equations converge for axisymmetric 3-geometries to the corresponding continuum RF equations. We demonstrate here that these DRF equations yield an explicit numerical realization of Thurston's geometrization procedure for a discrete 3D axially-symmetric neckpinch geometry by using surgery to explicitly integrate through its Type-1 neck pinch singularity. A cubic-spline-based adaptive mesh was required to complete the evolution. Our numerically efficient simulations yield the expected Thurston decomposition of the sufficiently pinched axially symmetric geometry into its unique geometric structure -- a direct product of two lobes, each collapsing toward a 3-sphere geometry. The structure of our curvature may be used to better inform one of the vertex and edge weighting factors that appear in the Forman's expression of Ricci curvature on graphs. ;"Differential Geometry (math.DG); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)"

Expressions of such connections are explicitly given. In particular, every Berger sphere with Lorentzian signature admits invariant metric affine connections Einstein with skew-torsion up to $\mathbb{S}^3$. For Riemannian signature, the existence of such connections strongly depends on the dimension of the sphere and on the scale of the deformation used for the Berger metric. In particular, there are Riemaniann Berger spheres, not Einstein, which admit invariant metric affine connections Einstein with skew-torsion. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)

Two theorems that are the super counterpart of Theorem~3.1.1 and Theorem~3.2.1 of D(11.3.1) are proved. They unify the notion of ""smooth maps from an Azumaya/matrix super smooth manifold with a fundamental module to a super smooth manifold"" introduced in D(11.2), making it a complete super parallel to the setting for D-branes in the realm of algebraic geometry in D(1) (arXiv:0709.1515 [math.AG]) and D(2) (arXiv:0809.2121 [math.AG]), and in the realm of differential or $C^{\infty}$-algebraic geometry in D(11.1) and D(11.3.1). A prototypical definition of dynamical fermionic stacked D-brane world-volume on a space-time in the same spirit of RNS fermionic strings or GS fermionic strings is thus laid down. Similar to D(11.3.1), which paved the path to the construction of non-Abelian Dirac-Born-Infeld action (D(13.1) (arXiv:1606.08529 [hep-th])) and the standard action (D(13.3) (arXiv:1704.03237 [hep-th])) for fundamental bosonic stacked D-branes, the current notes shall serve the same for the construction of supersymmetric action for fundamental fermionic stacked D-branes of various dimensions --- a theme of another subseries of the D-project.

We also give an algebraic characterization of all nilpotent groups that appear as the nilpotent approximation at a given point. In fact, given a nilpotent group $G$ satisfying this algebraic characterization, we exhibit all the changes of variables that transform a given system of privileged coordinates into another system of privileged coordinates in which the nilpotent approximation is given by $G$. ;"Differential Geometry (math.DG); Optimization and Control (math.OC)"

Besides the dimension and the volume of the manifold, the geometric quantity which plays an important role in these estimates is the first eigenvalue of the Hodge-de Rham Laplacian acting on co-exact 1-forms. In the 2-dimensional case, this is nothing but the first positive eigenvalue of the Laplacian acting on functions. As for the dependence of the bounds on the potentials, it brings into play the mean value of the scalar potential q, the L^2-norm of the magnetic field B=dA, and the distance, taken in L^2, between the harmonic component of A and the subspace of all closed 1-forms whose cohomology class is integral (that is, having integral flux around any loop).

In this paper, we provide a vast generalization of his results, by showing that there are natural sections of the corresponding line bundles for any $N \in \N$, which are mapped to each other under this isomorphism (with the previously known being the one for $N=0$). These canonical sections are important to define the fermionic part of the supersymmetric path integral on the loop space. ;"Differential Geometry (math.DG); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.10049;Macroscopic Schoen conjecture for manifolds with non-zero simplicial  volume; Florent Balacheff,  Steve Karam;  We prove that given a hyperbolic manifold endowed with an auxiliary Riemannian metric with negative sectional curvature and sufficently small volume in comparison to the hyperbolic one, we can always find for any radius at least $1$ a ball in its universal cover whose volume is bigger than the hyperbolic one. This is a corollary of another result holding without any curvature assumption that can be interpreted as a non-sharp macroscopic version of a conjecture by R.~Schoen about scalar curvature. The main ingredient in the proof of these results is an inequality due to M.~Gromov called {\it smoothing inequality}. One purpose of this work is to present a full and detailed account of this inequality which involves simplicial volume and deserves to be better known. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.10342;On Ricci negative solvmanifolds and their nilradicals; Jonas Deré,  Jorge Lauret;  In the homogeneous case, the only curvature behavior which is still far from being understood is Ricci negative. In this paper, we study which nilpotent Lie algebras admit a Ricci negative solvable extension. Different unexpected behaviors were found. On the other hand, given a nilpotent Lie algebra, we consider the space of all the derivations such that the corresponding solvable extension has a metric with negative Ricci curvature. Using the nice convexity properties of the moment map for the variety of nilpotent Lie algebras, we obtain a useful characterization of such derivations and some applications. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.10517;Smooth classifying spaces; J. Daniel Christensen,  Enxin Wu;  We develop the theory of smooth principal bundles for a smooth group $G$, using the framework of diffeological spaces. After giving new examples showing why arbitrary principal bundles cannot be classified, we define $D$-numerable bundles, the smooth analogs of numerable bundles from topology, and prove that pulling back a $D$-numerable bundle along smoothly homotopic maps gives isomorphic pullbacks. We then define smooth structures on Milnor's spaces $EG$ and $BG$, show that $EG \to BG$ is a $D$-numerable principal bundle, and prove that it classifies all $D$-numerable principal bundles over any diffeological space. We deduce analogous classification results for $D$-numerable diffeological bundles and vector bundles. ;Differential Geometry (math.DG)
