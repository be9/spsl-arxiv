https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.0060;Comparative studies of many-body corrections to an interacting Bose  condensate; Shohei Watabe,  Yoji Ohashi;  We compare many-body theories describing fluctuation corrections to the mean-field theory in a weakly interacting Bose-condensed gas. Using a generalized random-phase approximation, we include both density fluctuations and fluctuations in the particle-particle scattering channel in a consistent manner. We also separately examine effects of the fluctuations within the framework of the random-phase approximation. Effects of fluctuations in the particle-particle scattering channel are also separately examined by using the many-body T-matrix approximation. We assess these approximations with respect to the transition temperature, the order of phase transition, as well as the so-called Nepomnyashchii-Nepomnyashchii identity, which states the vanishing off-diagonal self-energy in the low-energy and low-momentum limit. Since the construction of a consistent theory for interacting bosons which satisfies various required conditions is a long standing problem in cold atom physics, our results would be useful for this important challenge. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.0181;Degenerate Bose Gas: A New Tool for Accurate Frequency Measurement; A.B. Bhattacherjee,  S. De;  We propose a new way of detecting frequencies using superradiant Rayleigh scattering from degenerate Bose gases. A measurement of the time evolution of population at the initial momentum state could determine an unknown frequency with respect to a known one at which the pump laser's frequency modulates. A range of frequencies from kHz to MHz could be determined with a fractional uncertainty of 10^{-6}. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.0219;Polarons, Dressed Molecules, and Itinerant Ferromagnetism in ultracold  Fermi gases; Pietro Massignan,  Matteo Zaccanti,  Georg M. Bruun;  In this review, we discuss the properties of a few impurity atoms immersed in a gas of ultracold fermions, the so-called Fermi polaron problem. On one side, this many-body system is appealing because it can be described almost exactly with simple diagrammatic and/or variational theoretical approaches. On the other, it provides quantitatively reliable insight into the phase diagram of strongly interacting population imbalanced quantum mixtures. In particular, we show that the polaron problem can be applied to study itinerant ferromagnetism, a long standing problem in quantum mechanics. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.0258;Topological Uniform Superfluid and FFLO Phases in 3D to 1D crossover of  spin-orbit coupled Fermi gases; Kangjun Seo,  Chuanwei Zhang,  Sumanta Tewari;"  We consider the quasi-one dimensional system realized by an array of weakly coupled parallel one-dimensional ""tubes"" in a two-dimensional lattice which permits free motion of atoms in an axial direction in the presence of a Zeeman field, Rashba type spin orbit coupling (SOC), and an s-wave attractive interaction, while the radial motion is tightly confined. We solve the zero-temperature (T=0) Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) equations for the quasi-1D Fermi gas with the dispersion modified by tunneling between the tubes, and show that the T=0 phase diagram hosts the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase with non-zero center of mass momentum Cooper pairs for small values of the SOC while for larger values of the SOC and high Zeeman fields the uniform superfluid phase with zero center of mass momentum Cooper pairs has an instability towards the topological uniform superfluid phase with Majorana fermions at the tube ends. Also, we show that tuning the two-dimensional optical lattice strength in this model allows one to explore the crossover behaviors of the phases during the transition between the 3D and the 1D system and in general the FFLO (for small SOC) and the topological uniform superfluid phase (for large SOC) are favored as the system becomes more one-dimensional. We also find evidence of the existence of a Zeeman tuned topological quantum phase transition (TQPT) within the FFLO phase itself and for large values of the Zeeman field and small SOC the TQPT gives rise to a topologically distinct FFLO phase.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.0272;Pair Correlations in the Two-Dimensional Fermi Gas; V. Ngampruetikorn,  J. Levinsen,  Meera M. Parish;  We consider the two-dimensional Fermi gas at finite temperature with attractive short-range interactions. Using the virial expansion, which provides a controlled approach at high temperatures, we determine the spectral function and contact for the normal state. Our calculated spectra are in qualitative agreement with recent photoemission measurements [M. Feld et al., Nature 480, 75 (2011)], thus suggesting that the observed pairing gap is a feature of the high-temperature gas rather than being evidence of a pseudogap regime just above the superfluid transition temperature. We further argue that the strong pair correlations result from the fact that the crossover to bosonic dimers occurs at weaker interactions than previously assumed. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.0514;String order in dipole-blockaded quantum liquids; Hendrik Weimer;  We study the quantum melting of quasi-one-dimensional lattice models in which the dominant energy scale is given by a repulsive dipolar interaction. By constructing an effective low-energy theory, we show that the melting of crystalline phases can occur into two distinct liquid phases, having the same algebraic decay of density-density correlations, but showing a different non-local correlation function expressing string order. We present possible experimental realizations using ultracold atoms and molecules, introducing an implementation based on resonantly driven Rydberg atoms that offers additional benefits compared to a weak admixture of the Rydberg state. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.0523;Formation and detection of a chiral orbital Bose liquid in an optical  lattice; Xiaopeng Li,  Arun Paramekanti,  Andreas Hemmerich,  W. Vincent Liu;"  Recent experiments on $p$-orbital atomic bosons have suggested the emergence of a spectacular ultracold superfluid with staggered orbital currents in optical lattices. This raises fundamental questions like the effects of collective thermal fluctuations, and how to directly observe such chiral order. Here, we show via Monte Carlo simulations that thermal fluctuations destroy this superfluid in an unexpected two-step process, unveiling an intermediate normal phase with spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry, dubbed ""chiral Bose liquid"". For integer fillings ($n\geq 2$) in the chiral Mott regime, thermal fluctuations are captured by an effective orbital Ising model, and Onsager's powerful exact solution is adopted to determine the transition from this intermediate liquid to the para-orbital normal phase at high temperature. A suitable lattice quench is designed to convert the staggered angular momentum, previously thought by experts difficult to directly probe, into coherent orbital oscillations, providing a smoking-gun signature of chiral order.

Yi;  We propose a novel scheme to generate the spin-orbit coupling for a condensate placed inside an optical cavity by using a standing wave and a traveling wave. It is shown that the interplay of the laser lights and the cavity gives rise to rich quantum phases. Our scheme also generates an nontrivial lattice of the magnetic flux, which may facilitate the study of the exotic quantum phases. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

Duine;  We consider dynamic, i.e., frequency-dependent, correlations in non-condensed ultracold atomic Bose gases. In particular, we consider the single-particle correlation function and its power spectrum. We compute this power spectrum for a one-component Bose gas, and show how it depends on the interatomic interactions that lead to a finite single-particle relaxation time. As another example, we consider the power spectrum of spin-current fluctuations for a two-component Bose gas and show how it is determined by the spin-transport relaxation time. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.0727;Spin relaxation in ultracold spin-orbit coupled $^{40}$K gas; T. Yu,  M. W. Wu;  We report the anomalous Dyakonov-Perel' spin relaxation in ultracold spin-orbit coupled $^{40}$K gas when the coupling between $|9/2,9/2\ >$ and $|9/2,7/2\ >$ states (atcing as the effective Zeeman magnetic field) is much stronger than the spin-orbit coupled field. Both the transverse and longitudinal spin relaxations are investigated with small and large spin polarizations. It is found that with small spin polarization, the transverse (longitudinal) spin relaxation is divided into four (two) regimes: the normal weak scattering regime, the anomalous Dyakonov-Perel'-like regime, the anomalous Elliott-Yafet-like regime and the normal strong scattering regime (the anomalous Elliott-Yafet-like regime and the normal strong scattering regime), with only the normal weak scattering regime being in the weak scattering limit. This is very different from the conventional situation under the weak magnetic field, which is divided into the weak and strong scattering regimes according to the weak/strong scattering limit. With large spin polarization, we find that the Hartree-Fock self-energy, which acts as an effective magnetic field, can markedly suppress the transverse spin relaxation in both weak and strong scattering limits. Moreover, by noting that as both the momentum relaxation time and the Hartree-Fock effective magnetic field vary with the scattering length in cold atoms, the anomalous Dyakonov-Perel'-like regime is suppressed and the transverse spin relaxation is hence divided into three regimes in the scattering length dependence: the normal weak scattering regime, the anomalous Elliott-Yafet-like regime and the strong scattering regime. On the other hand, the longitudinal spin relaxation is again divided into the anomalous EY-like and normal strong scattering regimes. ... ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)"

Suominen;  We propose a protocol for the simultaneous controlled creation of multiple concentric ring dark solitons in a toroidally trapped Bose-Einstein condensate.

L. Bohn;  We study the dynamics of a dilute Bose gas at zero temperature following a sudden quench of the scattering length from a noninteracting Bose condensate to unitarity (infinite scattering length). We apply three complementary approaches to understand the momentum distribution and loss rates. First, using a time-dependent variational ansatz for the many-body state, we calculate the dynamics of the momentum distribution. Second, we demonstrate that, at short times and large momenta compared to those set by the density, the physics can be well understood within a simple, analytic two-body model. We derive a quantitative prediction for the evolution of Tan's contact, which increases linearly at short times. We also study the three-body losses at finite densities. Consistent with experiments, we observe lifetimes which are long compared to the dynamics of large momentum modes. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.1139;The roton-assisted chiral p-wave superfluid in a quasi-two-dimensional  dipolar Bose-Fermi quantum gas mixture; Ben Kain,  Hong Y. Ling;  The chiral p-wave (p_x \pm ip_y) superfluid has attracted significant attention in recent years, mainly because its vortex core supports a Majorana fermion which, due to its non-Abelian statistics, can be explored for implementing topological quantum computation. Mixing dipolar bosons with fermions in quasi-two-dimensional (2D) space offers the opportunity to use the roton minimum as a tool for engineering the phonon-induced attractive interaction between fermions. We study, within the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approach, the p-wave superfluid pairings in a quasi-2D dipolar Bose-Fermi mixture. We show that enhancing the induced interaction by lowering the roton minimum can affect the stability property of the mixture as well as the effective mass of the fermions in an important way. We also show that one can tune the system to operate in stable regions where chiral p-wave superfluid pairings can be resonantly enhanced by lowering the energy cost of the phonons near the roton minimum. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.1421;Finite temperature effective field theory and two-band superfluidity in  Fermi gases; S.N. Klimin (1, 2),  J. Tempere (1, 3),  G. Lombardi (1),  J. T. Devreese (1, 4) ((1) TQC, Universiteit Antwerpen, Belgium, (2) State University of Moldova, (3) Lyman Laboratory of Physics, Harvard University, (4) Technische Universiteit Eindhoven);  We develop a description of fermionic superfluids in terms of an effective field theory for the pairing order parameter. Our effective field theory improves on the existing Ginzburg - Landau theory for superfluid Fermi gases in that it is not restricted to temperatures close to the critical temperature. This is achieved by taking into account long-range fluctuations to all orders. The results of the present effective field theory compare well with the results obtained in the framework of the Bogoliubov - de Gennes method. The advantage of an effective field theory over Bogoliubov - de Gennes calculations is that much less computation time is required. In the second part of the paper, we extend the effective field theory to the case of a two-band superfluid. The present theory allows us to reveal the presence of two healing lengths in the two-band superfluids, to analyze the finite-temperature vortex structure in the BEC-BCS crossover, and to obtain the ground state parameters and spectra of collective excitations. For the Leggett mode our treatment provides an interpretation of the observation of this mode in two-band superconductors. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.1441;Quantum Joule-Thomson Effect in a Saturated Homogeneous Bose Gas; Tobias F. Schmidutz,  Igor Gotlibovych,  Alexander L. Gaunt,  Robert P. Smith,  Nir Navon,  Zoran Hadzibabic;  We study the thermodynamics of Bose-Einstein condensation in a weakly interacting quasi-homogeneous atomic gas, prepared in an optical-box trap. We characterise the critical point for condensation and observe saturation of the thermal component in a partially condensed cloud, in agreement with Einstein's textbook picture of a purely statistical phase transition. Finally, we observe the quantum Joule-Thomson effect, namely isoenthalpic cooling of an (essentially) ideal gas. In our experiments this cooling occurs spontaneously, due to energy-independent collisions with the background gas in the vacuum chamber. We extract a Joule-Thomson coefficient $\mu_{\rm JT} > 10^9$ K/bar, about ten orders of magnitude larger than observed in classical gases. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.1672;Condensate Phase Microscopy; Arkadiusz Kosior,  Krzysztof Sacha;  We show that the phase of a Bose-Einstein condensate wave-function of ultra-cold atoms in an optical lattice potential in two-dimensions can be detected. The time-of-flight images, obtained in a free expansion of initially trapped atoms, are related to the initial distribution of atomic momenta but the information on the phase is lost. However, the initial atomic cloud is bounded and this information, in addition to the time-of-flight images, is sufficient in order to employ the phase retrieval algorithms. We analyze the phase retrieval methods for model wave-functions in a case of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a triangular optical lattice in the presence of artificial gauge fields. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

We find that the spectrum exhibits a surprisingly rich structure as a result of the interplay of interparticle interactions and population imbalance. We discuss the implication of these results in regard to the possibility of persistent currents at higher angular momenta. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.1786;Turbulence in Binary Bose-Einstein Condensates Generated by Highly  Non-Linear Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz Instabilities; D. Kobyakov,  A. Bezett,  E.

We show that the quantum vortex tangle is qualitatively different from previously considered superfluids, which reveals deep relations between QT and classical turbulence. The present QT may be generated at arbitrarily small Mach numbers, which is a unique property not found in previously studied superfluids. By numerical solution of the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations we find that the Kolmogorov scaling law holds for the incompressible kinetic energy. We demonstrate that the phenomenon may be observed in the laboratory. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.1925;Universal Trimers induced by Spin-Orbit Coupling in Ultracold Fermi  Gases; Zhe-Yu Shi,  Xiaoling Cui,  Hui Zhai;  In this letter we address the issue how synthetic spin-orbit (SO) coupling can strongly affect three-body physics in ultracold atomic gases. We consider a system which consists of three fermionic atoms, including two spinless heavy atoms and one spin-1/2 light atom subjected to an isotropic SO coupling. We find that SO coupling can induce universal three-body bound states with negative s-wave scattering length at a smaller mass ratio, where no trimer bound state can exist if in the absence of SO coupling. The energies of these trimers are independent of high-energy cutoff, and therefore they are universal ones. Moreover, the resulting atom-dimer resonance can be effectively controlled by SO coupling strength. Our results can be applied to systems like ${}^6$Li and ${}^{40}$K mixture. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.1927;Universality and scaling in the $N$-body sector of Efimov physics; M. Gattobigio,  A. Kievsky;  Universal behaviour has been found inside the window of Efimov physics for systems with $N=4,5,6$ particles. Efimov physics refers to the emergence of a number of three-body states in systems of identical bosons interacting {\it via} a short-range interaction becoming infinite at the verge of binding two particles. These Efimov states display a discrete scale invariance symmetry, with the scaling factor independent of the microscopic interaction. Their energies in the limit of zero-range interaction can be parametrized, as a function of the scattering length, by a universal function. We have found, using a particular form of finite-range scaling, that the same universal function can be used to parametrize the energies of $N\le6$ systems inside the Efimov-physics window. Moreover, we show that the same finite-scale analysis reconciles experimental measurements of three-body binding energies with the universal theory. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.1938;Thermometry of cold atoms in optical lattices via artificial gauge  fields; Tommaso Roscilde;  Artificial gauge fields are a unique way of manipulating the motional state of cold atoms. Here we propose the use of artificial gauge fields -- obtained e.g. via lattice shaking -- to perform primary noise thermometry of cold atoms in optical lattices - not requiring any form of prior calibration. The proposed thermometric scheme relies on fundamental fluctuation-dissipation relations, connecting the global response to the variation of the applied gauge field and the fluctuation of quantities related to the momentum distribution (such as the average kinetic energy or the average current). We demonstrate gauge-field thermometry for several physical situations, including free fermions and strongly interacting bosons. The proposed approach is extremely robust to quantum fluctuations - even in the vicinity of a quantum phase transition - when it relies on the thermal fluctuations of an emerging classical field, associated with the onset of Bose condensation or chiral order. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

Custom method of finding maximally-localized Wannier functions enables us to compute physical tunneling coefficients, which put some restrictions on the studies of the model, what have recently been done using arbitrary values of parameters. Furthermore, it turns out that out of s-p resonance the system splits up into two disconnected lattices. We analyze also Zak-Berry phase and single-particle spectrum of the system. In order to present the problem in the full context, short review of rudiments of optical lattice physics and derivation of the standard Bose-Hubbard model is included. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.2257;Probing the circulation of ring-shaped Bose-Einstein condensates; Noel Murray,  Michael Krygier,  Mark Edwards,  K. C. Wright,  G. K. Campbell,  Charles W. Clark;  This paper reports the results of a theoretical and experimental study of how the initial circulation of ring-shaped Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) can be probed by time-of-flight (TOF) images. We have studied theoretically the dynamics of a BEC after release from a toroidal trap potential by solving the 3D Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation. The trap and condensate characteristics matched those of a recent experiment. The circulation, experimentally imparted to the condensate by stirring, was simulated theoretically by imprinting a linear azimuthal phase on the initial condensate wave function. The theoretical TOF images were in good agreement with the experimental data. We find that upon release the dynamics of the ring--shaped condensate proceeds in two distinct phases. First, the condensate expands rapidly inward, filling in the initial hole until it reaches a minimum radius that depends on the initial circulation. In the second phase, the density at the inner radius increases to a maximum after which the hole radius begins slowly to expand. During this second phase a series of concentric rings appears due to the interference of ingoing and outgoing matter waves from the inner radius. The results of the GP equation predict that the hole area is a quadratic function of the initial circulation when the condensate is released directly from the trap in which it was stirred and is a linear function of the circulation if the trap is relaxed before release. These scalings matched the data. Thus, hole size after TOF can be used as a reliable probe of initial condensate circulation. This connection between circulation and hole size after TOF will facilitate future studies of atomtronic systems that are implemented in ultracold quantum gases. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

We focus on the equilibrium phase diagram of spinless fermions coupled to a single cavity mode and establish a zero temperature transition to a superradiant state. In contrast to the bosonic case, Pauli blocking leads to lattice commensuration effects that influence self-organization in the cavity light field. This includes a sequence of discontinuous transitions with increasing atomic density and tricritical superradiance. We discuss the implications for experiment. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.2674;Artificial magnetic field induced by an evanescent wave; Malgorzata Mochol,  Krzysztof Sacha;  Cold atomic gases are perfect laboratories for realization of quantum simulators. In order to simulate solid state systems in the presence of magnetic fields special effort has to be made because atoms are charge neutral. There are different methods for realization of artificial magnetic fields, that is the creation of specific conditions so that the motion of neutral particles mimics the dynamics of charged particles in an effective magnetic field. Here, we consider adiabatic motion of atoms in the presence of an evanescent wave. Theoretical description of the adiabatic motion involves artificial vector and scalar potentials related to the Berry phases. Due to the large gradient of the evanescent field amplitude, the potentials can be strong enough to induce measurable effects in cold atomic gases. We show that the resulting artificial magnetic field is able to induce vortices in a Bose-Einstein condensate trapped close to a surface of a prism where the evanescent wave is created. We also analyze motion of an atomic cloud released from a magneto-optical trap that falls down on the surface of the prism. The artificial magnetic field is able to reflect falling atoms that can be observed experimentally. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

Superradiant light generation and self-organization of the atoms can be achieved at low pumping threshold due to resonant atom-photon Umklapp processes, where the fermions are scattered from one side of the Fermi surface to the other by exchanging photon momenta. The cavity spectrum exhibits sidebands, that, despite strong atom-light coupling and cavity decay, retain narrow linewidth, due to absorptionless transparency windows outside the atomic particle-hole continuum and the suppression of inhomogeneous broadening and thermal fluctuations in the collisionless Fermi gas. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.2769;Supersolid structure and excitation spectrum of soft-core bosons in 3D; Francesco Ancilotto,  Maurizio Rossi,  Flavio Toigo;  By means of a mean-field method, we have studied the zero temperature structure and excitation spectrum of a three-dimensional soft-core bosonic system for a value of the interaction strength that favors a crystal structure made of atomic nano-clusters arranged with FCC ordering. In addition to the longitudinal and transverse phonon branches expected for a normal crystal, the excitation spectrum shows a soft mode related to the breaking of gauge symmetry, which signals a partial superfluid character of the solid. Additional evidence of supersolidity is provided by the calculation of the superfluid fraction, which shows a first-order drop, from 1 to 0.4, at the liquid-supersolid transition and a monotonic decrease as the interaction strength parameter is increased. The conditions for the coexistence of the supersolid with the homogeneous superfluid are discussed, and the surface tension of a representative solid-liquid interface is calculated. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.3081;Soliton-based matter wave interferometer; Juan Polo,  Verònica Ahufinger;  We consider a matter wave bright soliton interferometer composed of a harmonic potential trap with a Rosen--Morse barrier at its center on which an incident soliton collides and splits into two solitons. These two solitons recombine after a dipole oscillation in the trap at the position of the barrier. We focus on the characterization of the splitting process in the case in which the reflected and transmitted solitons have the same number of atoms. We obtain that the velocity of the split solitons strongly depends on the nonlinearity and on the width of the barrier and that the reflected soliton is in general slower than the transmitted one. Also, we study the phase difference acquired between the two solitons during the splitting and we fit semi-analytically the main dependences with the velocity of the incident soliton, the nonlinearity and the width of the barrier. The implementation of the full interferometer sequence is tested by means of the phase imprinting method. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

Silva Fernández,  A. Bramati,  G. Gigli,  A. Kavokin,  F. Laussy,  D. Sanvitto;  Polaritons in microcavities are versatile quasi-2D bosonic particles with a high degree of coherence and strong nonlinearities, thanks to their hybrid light-matter character. In their condensed form, they display striking quantum hydrodynamic features analogous to atomic Bose-Einstein condensates, such as long-range order coherence, superfluidity and quantized vorticity. Their variegated dispersive and dissipative properties, however, set significant differences from their atomic counterpart. In this work, we report the unique phenomenology that is observed when a pulse of light impacts the polariton vacuum: the condensate that is instantaneously formed does not splash in real space but instead coheres into an enigmatic structure, featuring concentric rings and, most notably, a sharp and bright peak at the center. Using a state-of-the-art ultrafast imaging with 50 fs time steps, we are able to track the dynamics of the polariton mean-field wavefunction in both real and reciprocal space. The observation of the real-space collapse of the condensate into an extremely localized---resolution limited---peak is at odd with the repulsive interactions of polaritons and their positive effective mass. An unconventional mechanism is therefore at play to account for our observations. Our modeling suggests that self-trapping due to a local heating of the crystal lattice---that can be described as a collective polaron formed by a polariton condensate---could be involved. These observations hint at the fascinating fluid dynamics of polaritons in conditions of extreme intensities and ultrafast times. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.3205;Cold Bose Atoms Around the Crossing of Quantum Waveguides; A. Markowsky,  N. Schopohl;  We show that massive low energy particles traversing a branching zone or a crossing of quantum waveguides may experience a non standard trapping force that cannot be derived from a potential. For interacting cold Bose atoms we report on the formation of a localised Hartree ground state for three prototype waveguide geometries with broken translational symmetry: a cranked L-shaped waveguide L, a T-shaped waveguide T, and the crossing C of two quantum waveguides. The phenomenon is kinetic energy driven and cannot be described within the Thomas-Fermi approximation. Depending on the ratio of joining lateral tube diameters of the respective waveguides C,L,T delocalisation commences when the particle number N approaches a critical value. For the case of a binary mixture of two different Bose atom species A and B we observe non standard trapping of both atom species for subcritical particle numbers. A sudden demixing quantum transition takes place as the total particle number N=N_{A}+N_{B} is increased at fixed mixing ratio N_{A}/N_{B}. Depending on the mass ratio m_{A}/m_{B} the heavier atom species delocalises first for a wide range of interaction parameters. The numerical calculations are based on a splitting scheme involving an analytic approximation to the short time asymptotics of the imaginary time quantum propagator of a single particle obeying to Dirichlet boundary conditions at the walls inside the respective waveguides. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

In a uniform system, a flat domain wall is stabilized and then the translational invariance normal to the wall is spontaneously broken in addition to the breaking of two U(1) symmetries in the presence of two complex order parameters. We clarify properties of the low-energy excitations and identify that there exist two Nambu-Goldstone modes: in-phase phonon with a linear dispersion and ripplon with a fractional dispersion. The signature of the characteristic dispersion can be verified in segregated condensates in a harmonic potential. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.3225;Creation of matter wave Bessel beams; C. Ryu,  K. C. Henderson,  M. G. Boshier;  Bessel beams are plane waves with amplitude profiles described by Bessel functions. They are important because of their property of limited diffraction and their capacity to carry orbital angular momentum. Here we report the creation of a Bessel beam of de Broglie matter waves. The Bessel beam is produced by the free evolution of a thin toroidal atomic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) which has been set into rotational motion. By attempting to stir it at different rotation rates, we show that the toroidal BEC can only be made to rotate at discrete, equally-spaced frequencies, demonstrating that circulation is quantized in atomic BECs. The method used here to generate matter wave Bessel beams with a Painted Potential can be viewed as a form of wavefunction engineering which might be extended to implement arbitrary cold atom matter wave holography. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

The quantum evolution of the system is numerically modeled by a truncated Wigner method based on a full microscopic description of the condensate and state non-separability is assessed by applying a generalized Peres-Horodecki criterion. The peculiar distribution of entanglement is described in both real and momentum spaces and its robustness against increasing initial temperature is investigated. Viable strategies to experimentally detect the predicted phonon entanglement are briefly discussed. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

Introducing a new version of the Yudson representation applicable to finite size systems and appropriately taking the infinite volume limit we are able to study equilibration of the Lieb Liniger gas in the thermodynamic limit. We provide a formalism to compute various correlation functions for highly non equilibrium initial states. We are able to find explicit analytic expressions for the long time limit of the expectation of the density, density density and related correlation functions. We show that the gas equilibriates to a diagonal ensemble which we show is equivalent to a generalized version of the GGE for sufficiently simple correlation functions, which in particular include density correlations. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

From the corresponding Onsager relations we extract linear response transport coefficients in analogy to the electronic conductance, thermal conductance and thermopower. Considering ideal Fermi and Bose gas reservoirs we observe steady-state currents against the thermal bias as a result of the non-linearities introduced by the constraint of a constant particle density in the reservoirs. Most importantly, we find signatures of the on-set of Bose-Einstein condensation in the transport coefficients. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

Vogt et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 070404 (2012)], quadrupole and breathing modes of a two-dimensional Fermi gas were studied. We model these collective modes by solving the Boltzmann equation via the method of phase-space moments up to fourth order, including in-medium effects on the scattering cross section. In our analysis, we use a realistic Gaussian potential deformed by the presence of gravity and magnetic field gradients. We conclude that the origin of the experimentally observed damping of the quadrupole mode, especially in the weakly interacting (or even non-interacting) case, cannot be explained by these mechanisms. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.3784;Superradiance of Degenerate Fermi Gases in a Cavity; Yu Chen,  Zhenhua Yu,  Hui Zhai;  In this letter we consider spinless Fermi gases placed inside a cavity and study the critical strength of pumping field for driving a superradiance transition. We emphasize that Fermi surface nesting effect strongly enhances the superradiance tendency. Around certain fillings, when the Fermi surface is nearly nested with a relevant nesting momentum, the susceptibility of the system toward a checkboard density-wave ordered state is strongly enhanced, because of which a much smaller (sometime even vanishingly small) critical pumping field strength can lead to superradiance. This leads to interesting reentrance behavior and topologically distinct structure in the phase diagram. Away from these fillings, the Pauli exclusion principle brings about the dominant effect for which the critical pumping strength is lowered in the low-density regime and increased in the high-density regime, in comparison to a Bose gas with same density. These results open the prospect of studying rich phenomena of degenerate Fermi gases in cavity. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

At the same time, the single-site-resolved detection of individual atoms has become a new powerful experimental tool. We discuss a protocol for the single-site resolved measurement of the current statistics of quantum many-body systems, which makes use of a bichromatic optical superlattice and single-site detection. We illustrate the protocol by a numerical study of the current statistics for interacting bosons in one and two dimensions and discuss the role of the on-site interactions for the current pattern and the ground-state symmetry for small two-dimensional lattices with artificial magnetic fields. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

Within a dissipative mean-field approach we simulate a two-component condensate in conditions adapted to the experiment. In qualitative agreement with the experimental findings, we observe persistent currents, if the spin-population imbalance is above some well-defined `critical' value. The triply charged vortices decay in quantized steps. The vortex lines escape from the center of the ring through dynamically created regions in the condensate annulus with reduced density of one component filled by atoms of the other component. The vortices then leave the ring-shaped high density region of the condensate and finally decay into elementary excitations. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

For large values of the tilt, we observe interaction-induced coherent decay and matter-wave quantum phase revivals of the Bloch oscillating ensemble. We analyze the revival period dependence on interactions by means of a Feshbach resonance. When reducing the value of the tilt, we observe the disappearance of the quasi-periodic phase revival signature towards an irreversible decay of Bloch oscillations, indicating the transition from regular to quantum chaotic dynamics. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.4097;Seeing Hofstadter's Butterfly in Atomic Fermi Gases; Lei Wang,  Matthias Troyer;  We propose a novel way to detect the fractal energy spectrum of the Hofstadter model from the density distributions of ultracold fermions in an external trap. At low temperature, the local compressibility is proportional to the density of states of the system which reveals the fractal energy spectrum. However, thermal broadening and noises in the real experimental situation inevitably smear out fine features in the density distribution. To overcome this difficulty, we use the maximum entropy method to extract the density of states directly from the noisy thermal density distributions. Simulations show that one is able to restore the core feature of the Hofstadter's butterfly spectrum with current experimental techniques. By further reducing the noise or the temperature, one can refine the resolution and observe fine structures of the butterfly spectrum. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

The Raman coupling gives rise to effective spin-orbit interaction which couples atom's center-of-mass motion to its pseudospin degrees of freedom. Meanwhile, the cavity photon is dynamically affected by the atom. This feedback between atom and photon leads to a dramatic modification of the atomic dispersion relation, and further leads to dynamical instability of the system. We propose to detect the change of cavity photon number as a direct way to demonstrate dynamical instability. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

This procedure, that is suitable for spatial light modulator devices, allows one to increase the localization efficiency of the speckle in a narrow energy region whose position can be easily tuned. This peculiar energy-dependent localization behavior is explored by pulling the potential through a cigar-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate. We show that the percentage of dragged atoms as a function of the pulling velocity depends on the potential correlations below a threshold of the disorder strength. Above this threshold, interference effects are no longer clearly observable during the condensate drag. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

Using this new approach, we analytically obtain some universal properties of dipolar CIRs in quasi-one-dimensional (1D) waveguides. We also show that the dipolar CIRs can be induced by tuning the angle between the dipole moments and the waveguide, which is experimentally observable in quasi-1D Cr and Dy atomic gases. We expect that these tilting angle induced CIRs will open up a new simpler way to control the resonant scatterings in quasi-low-dimensional systems. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.5335;Landau Levels in Lattices with Long Range Hopping; Hakan Atakişi,  M.Ö. Oktel;  In the presence of a periodic potential Landau levels (LLs) are broadened, forming a barrier for accurate simulation of fractional quantum Hall effect using cold atoms in optical lattices. Recently, it has been shown that the degeneracy of the lowest Landau level (LLL) can be restored in a tight binding lattice, if a particular form of long range hopping is introduced [E. Kapit and E. J. Mueller, Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 215303 (2010)]. In this paper, we investigate three problems related to such quantum Hall parent Hamiltonians in lattices. First, we show that there are infinitely many long range hopping models in which a massively degenerate manifold is formed by lattice discretizations of wavefunctions in the continuum LLL. We then give a general method to construct such models, which is applicable to not only the LLL but also higher LLs. We use this method to give an analytic expression for the hoppings that restore the LLL, and an integral expression for the next LL. We also consider whether the space spanned by discretized LL wavefunctions is as large as the space spanned by continuum wavefunctions and find the constraints on magnetic field for this condition to be satisfied. Finally, using these constraints and first Chern numbers, we identify the bands of the Hofstadter butterfly that correspond to continuum LLs. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

In the presence of mass imbalance, we point out that the ordinary $T$-matrix approximation, which has been extensively used to clarify various BCS-BEC crossover physics in the mass-balanced case, unphysically gives a double-valued solution in terms of the superfluid phase transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ in the crossover region. To overcome this serious problem, we include higher order strong-coupling corrections beyond the $T$-matrix level. Using this extended $T$-matrix theory, we calculate single-particle excitations in the normal state above $T_{\rm c}$. The so-called pseudogap phenomena originating from pairing fluctuations are shown to be different between the light mass component and heavy mass component, which becomes more remarkable at higher temperatures. Since Fermi condensates with hetero-Cooper pairs have recently been discussed in various fields, such as exciton (polariton) condensates, as well as color superconductivity, our results would be useful for the further development of Fermi superfluid physics, beyond the conventional superfluid state with homo-Cooper pairs. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.5683;Fate of Topology in Spin-1 Spinor Bose-Einstein Condensate; Yun-Tak Oh,  Panjin Kim,  Jin-Hong Park,  Jung Hoon Han;"  One of the excitements generated by the cold atom systems is the possibility to realize, and explore, varied topological phases stemming from multi-component nature of the condensate. Popular examples are the antiferromagnetic (AFM) and the ferromagnetic (FM) phases in the three-component atomic condensate with effective spin-1, to which different topological manifolds can be assigned. It follows, from consideration of homotopy, that different sorts of topological defects will be stable in each manifold. For instance, Skyrmionic texture is believed to be a stable topological object in two-dimensional AFM spin-1 condensate. Countering such common perceptions, here we show on the basis of a new wave function decomposition scheme that there is no physical parameter regime wherein the temporal dynamics of spin-1 condensate can be described solely within AFM or FM manifold. Initial state of definite topological number prepared entirely within one particular phase must immediately evolve into a mixed state. Accordingly, the very notion of topology and topological stability within the sub-manifold of AFM or FM become invalid. Numerical simulation reveals the linear Zeeman effect to be an efficient catalyst to extract the alternate component from an initial topological object prepared entirely within one particular sub-manifold, serving as a potential new tool for ""topology engineering"" in multi-component Bose-Einstein condensates.

When the distance between them is larger than a critical value, we recover that the homogeneous solution is unstable, and we identify the lowest energy state. We show that it can be viewed as determining the saturated value of the first (node-less) complex frequency mode which drives the instability. We also classify the set of stationary solutions and establish their relation both with the set of complex frequency modes and with known soliton solutions. Finally, we adopt a procedure \`a la Pitaevski-Baym-Pethick to construct the effective functional which governs the transition from the homogeneous to non-homogeneous solutions. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)"

We start by showing how the existence of the self-interference can be inferred from the Wigner function representation of the ring. Then, using analytical expressions for the time-evolution of a freely expanding ring condensate with and without a persistent current, we show that the self-interference of the ring condensate is possible only in the absence of the persistent current. We conclude by proposing an experimental protocol for the creation of ring dark solitons using the toroidal self-interference. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

We use the stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii equation, which is the Langevin equation for the Bose-Einstein condensate, to this end. For a pair of vortices, we study the dynamics of both the vortex-vortex and vortex-antivortex pairs, which are generated by rotating the trap and moving the Gaussian obstacle potential, respectively. Due to thermal fluctuations, the constituent vortices are not symmetrically generated with respect to each other at finite temperatures. This initial asymmetry coupled with the presence of random thermal fluctuations in the system can lead to different decay rates for the component vortices of the pair, especially in the case of two corotating vortices. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

We find that density and velocity fluctuations have white-noise power spectra at large frequencies and that Kolmogorov 5/3 law is obeyed in the turbulent region. As the stirring is turned off, the flow decays to an agitated non-equilibrium state that shows an energy bottleneck crossover at small length scales. We demonstrate our findings by numerically solving two-state spinor coupled 3D Gross-Pitaevskii equations. We suggest that this mechanism may be experimentally implemented in spinor ultracold gases confined by optical traps. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

Caballar,  Sebastian Diehl,  Harri Mäkelä,  Markus Oberthaler,  Gentaro Watanabe;  We develop a dissipative quantum state preparation scheme for the creation of phase- and number-squeezed states. It utilizes ultracold atoms in a double-well configuration immersed in a background Bose-Einstein condensate, with the latter consisting of an atom species different from the atoms in the double well and acting as a dissipative quantum reservoir. We derive a master equation for this system starting from microscopic physics, and show that squeezing develops on a time scale proportional to $1/N$, where $N$ is the number of particles in the double well. This scaling, caused by bosonic enhancement, allows us to make the time scale for the creation of squeezed states very short. The lifetime of squeezed states is limited by dephasing arising from the intrinsic structure of the setup. However, the dephasing can be avoided by stroboscopically switching the driving off and on. We show that this approach leads to robust stationary squeezed states. Finally, we provide the necessary ingredients for a potential experimental implementation by specifying a parameter regime for rubidium atoms that leads to squeezed states. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

Quasi-particle excitations of the atomic cloud cause density fluctuations which can induce the collapse of the condensate if the inter-particle interaction is attractive. Within a variational approach, we identify the collectively excited stationary states of the gas which form transition states on the way to the BEC's collapse. We analyze transition states with different $m$-fold rotational symmetry and identify the one which mediates the collapse. The latter's symmetry depends on the trap aspect ratio of the external trapping potential which determines the shape of the BEC. Moreover, we present the collapse dynamics of the BEC and calculate the corresponding decay rate using transition state theory. We observe that the thermally induced collapse mechanism is important near the critical scattering length, where the lifetime of the condensate can be significantly reduced. Our results are valid for an arbitrary strength of the dipole-dipole interaction. Specific applications are discussed for the elements $^{52}$Cr, $^{164}$Dy and $^{168}$Er with which dipolar BECs have been experimentally realized. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

We also show that the observed atom loss rate is compatible with that from 3-atom inelastic collisions, which gives a contribution proportional to the 3-body contact, but the loss rate is not compatible with that from 2-atom inelastic collisions, which gives a contribution proportional to the 2-body contact. We point out that the contacts could be measured independently by using the virial theorem near and at unitarity. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)"

Our approach models the experiments of Yefsah et. al. [Nature \textbf{499}, 426] on $^6$Li in the BEC regime where the fermions are tightly bound into bosonic dimers. We find ring oscillation periods which are much larger than the period of the axial harmonic trap. Our results lend further strength to Bulgac et. al.'s arguments [arXiv: 1306.4266] that the ""heavy solitons"" seen in those experiments are actually vortex rings. We numerically calculate the periods of oscillation for the vortex rings as a function of interaction strength, trap aspect ratio, and minimum vortex ring radius. In the presence of axial anisotropies the rings undergo complicated internal dynamics where they break into sets of vortex lines, then later combine into rings. These structures oscillate with a similar frequency to simple axially symmetric rings. ";Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

Starting point is a microscopic description of the system in terms of a many-body quantum master equation, where coherent and driven-dissipative dynamics occur on an equal footing. An equivalent Keldysh real time functional integral reformulation opens up the problem to a practical evaluation using the tools of quantum field theory. In particular, we develop a functional renormalization group approach to quantitatively explore the universality class of this stationary non-equilibrium system. Key results comprise the emergence of an asymptotic thermalization of the distribution function, while manifest non-equilibrium properties are witnessed in the response properties in terms of a new, independent critical exponent. Thus the driven-dissipative microscopic nature is seen to bear observable consequences on the largest length scales. The absence of two symmetries present in closed equilibrium systems - underlying particle number conservation and detailed balance, respectively - is identified as the root of this new non-equilibrium critical behavior.

This is demonstrated in an analytically solvable model for three equal mass particles, two of which are identical bosons, which is exact in the strongly-interacting limit. We numerically verify our results by presenting the first application of the stochastic variational method to this kind of system. We also demonstrate that the limit where both inter- and intra-component interactions become strong must be treated with extreme care as these limits do not commute. Moreover, we argue that such states are generic also for general multi-component systems with more than three particles. The states can be probed using the same techniques that have recently been used for fermionic few-body systems in quasi-1D. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.7326;Path-Integral Ground-State and Superfluid Hydrodynamics of a Bosonic Gas  of Hard Spheres; Maurizio Rossi,  Luca Salasnich;  We study a bosonic gas of hard spheres by using of the exact zero-temperature Path-Integral Ground-State (PIGS) Monte Carlo method and the equations of superfluid hydrodynamics. The PIGS method is implemented to calculate for the bulk system the energy per particle and the condensate fraction through a large range of the gas parameter $na^3$ (with $n$ the number density and $a$ the s--wave scattering length), going from the dilute gas into the solid phase. The Maxwell construction is then adopted to determine the freezing at $na^3=0.278\pm 0.001$ and the melting at $na^3=0.286\pm 0.001$. In the liquid phase, where the condensate fraction is finite, the equations of superfluid hydrodynamics, based on the PIGS equation of state, are used to find other relevant quantities as a function of the gas parameter: the chemical potential, the pressure and the sound velocity. In addition, within the Feynman's approximation, from the PIGS static structure factor we determine the full excitation spectrum, which displays a maxon-roton behavior when the gas parameter is close to the freezing value. Finally, the equations of superfluid hydrodynamics with the PIGS equation of state are solved for bosonic system under axially--symmetric harmonic confinement obtaining its collective breathing modes. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

We find that the short-range spin correlations are significantly enhanced in the direction with stronger tunneling amplitudes. Our results agree with the experimental observations and show that the experimental temperature is lower than the strong tunneling amplitude. We characterize the system by examining the spin correlations beyond neighboring sites and determine the distribution of density, entropy and spin correlation in the trapped system. We furthermore investigate the dependence of the critical entropy at the N\'eel transition on anisotropy. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.7408;Dark solitons dynamics and snake instability in superfluid Fermi gases  trapped by an anisotropic harmonic potential; Wen Wen,  Changqing Zhao,  Xiaodong Ma;  We present an investigation of generation, dynamics and stability of dark solitons in anisotropic Fermi gases for a range of particle numbers and trap aspect ratios within the framework of the order-parameter equation. We calculate the periods of dark solitons oscillating in a trap, and find a good agreement with the results based on the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. By studying the stability of initially off-center dark solitons under various tight transverse confinements in the unitarity limit, we not only give the criterion of dynamical stability, but also find that the soliton and a hybrid of solitons and vortex rings can be characterized by different oscillation period. The stability criterion is not fulfilled by the parameters of the recent experiment [Nature {\bf 499}, 426 (2013)]. Therefore, instead of a very slow oscillation as observed experimentally, we find that the created dark soliton undergoes a transverse snake instability with collapsing into vortex rings, which propagate in soliton-like manner with a nearly two times larger period. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

In particular at zero temperature, our theory distinguishes within its validity range between various superfluid phases for an anti-ferromagnetic interaction with an external magnetic field. In addition, we determine that the superfluid-Mott insulator phase transition is of second order and that the transitions between the respective superfluid phases with anti-ferromagnetic interaction can be both of first and second order. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

For sufficiently high dye concentration the coupling of the Dicke states with light will dominate over local decoherence. This system also shows Mott criticality despite the absence of an underlying lattice in the limit when all dye molecules become excited. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

Our scheme relies on two sets of Raman laser beams to engineer the hopping between adjacent sites populated by two-component fermionic atoms. One set of Raman beams are used to realize a staggered \pi-flux lattice, where low energy atoms near two inequivalent Dirac points should be described by the Dirac equation for spin-1/2 particles. Another set of laser beams with proper Rabi frequencies are added to further modulate the atomic hopping parameters. The hopping modulation will give rise to effective gauge potentials with opposite signs near the two valleys, mimicking the interesting strain-induced pseudo-gauge fields in graphene. The proposed valley-dependent gauge fields are tunable and provide a new route to realize quantum valley Hall effects and atomic valleytronics. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

O'Dell;  We study a model describing $N$ identical bosonic atoms trapped in a double-well potential together with a single impurity atom, comparing and contrasting it throughout with the Dicke model. As the boson-impurity coupling strength is varied, there is a symmetry-breaking pitchfork bifurcation which is analogous to the quantum phase transition occurring in the Dicke model. Through stability analysis around the bifurcation point, we show that the critical value of the coupling strength has the same dependence on the parameters as the critical coupling value in the Dicke model. We also show that, like the Dicke model, the mean-field dynamics go from being regular to chaotic above the bifurcation and macroscopic excitations of the bosons are observed. Overall, the boson-impurity system behaves like a poor man's version of the Dicke model. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

With the Born-Oppenheimer method, we analytically show that the induced interaction between N heavy particles vanishes for any N in the limit of high light-fermion density. The induced interaction vanishes even in the unitarity regime. This suggests that the formation of N-body bound states associated with the Efimov effect is suppressed in the presence of the dense Fermi sea. We ascribe the vanishing induced interaction to the screening effect in the neutral Fermi system. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph)"

When the particle densities of fermionic atoms and Feshbach molecules differ, the system undergoes various depletion transitions between binary and ternary mixtures, as a function of the detuning parameter. However, when the particle densities of fermionic atoms and Feshbach molecules are identical, the molecular conversion and disassociation processes induce a gap in a sector of low-energy excitations, and the remaining system can be described by a two-component Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid. Using a bosonization scheme, we derive the effective low-energy Hamiltonian for the system, which has a similar form as that of the two-chain problem of coupled Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids. With the help of improved perturbative renormalization group analysis of the latter problem, we determine the ground-state phase diagram and find that it contains a phase dominated by composite superfluid or pairing correlations between the open and closed resonant channels. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)"

We study the evolution of the Lieb-Liniger model, a gas of interacting bosons moving on the continuous infinite line and interacting via a short range potential. The formalism allows us to quench the system from any initial state. We find that for any value of repulsive coupling independently of the initial state the system asymptotes towards a strongly repulsive gas, while for any value of attractive coupling, the system forms a maximal bound state that dominates at longer times. In either case the system equilibrates but does not thermalize. We compare this to quenches in a Bose-Hubbard lattice and show that there, initial states determine long-time dynamics independent of the sign of the coupling. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)"

In contrast to the much studied single band Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian, this more complex model allows for non-trivial superfluid phases associated with condensation at non-zero momentum and staggered order of the orbital angular momentum in addition to the superfluid-Mott insulator transition. More specifically, we observe staggered orbital angular momentum order in the Mott phase at commensurate filling and superfluidity at all densities. We also observe a transition between the staggered angular momentum superfluid phase and a striped superfluid, with an alternation of the phase of the superfluid along one direction. The transition between these two phases was observed in a recent experiment, which is then qualitatively well described by our model. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

We find the form of the nonunitary tunneling matrices in terms of the metric tensor. The main motivation behind this exercise is the feasibility of such Hamiltonians by means of laser assisted tunnelings in cold atomic experiments. The mapping thus provide a physical interpretation of such Hamiltonians. We demonstrate the use of the mapping on the example of time dependent metric in 2+1 dimensions. Studying the spin dynamics, we find qualitative agreement with known theoretical predictions, namely the particle pair creation in expanding universe. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

The flexibility of the method let us to study cases of the artificial magnetic field being uniform, staggered or forming a checkerboard configuration. Effects of additional temporal modulation of the optical potential that results from application of Raman lasers driving particle transitions between lattice sites are also included. The presented time-of-flight patterns may serve as a verification of chosen gauge in experiments, but also provide important hints on unconventional, non-zero momentum condensates, or possibility of observing graphene-like physics resulting from occurrence of Dirac cones in artificial magnetic fields in systems of ultra-cold bosons in optical lattices. Also, we elucidate on differences between effects of magnetic field in solids and the artificial magnetic field in optical lattices, which can be controlled on much higher level leading to effects not possible in condensed matter physics. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

The density distributions of spin singlet paired bosons and polarized bosons with different total polarization for various interaction parameters are obtained by solving the Kohn-Sham equations which are derived based on the local density approximation and the Bethe ansatz exact results for homogeneous system. Non-monotonicity of the central densities is attributed to the competition between the density interaction and spin-exchange. The results reveal the phase separation of the paired and polarized bosons, the density profiles of which respectively approach the Tonks-Girardeau gases of Bose-Bose pairs and scalar bosons in the case of strong interaction. We give the R-P phase diagram at strong interaction and find the critical polarization, which paves the way to direct observe the exotic singlet pairing in spinor gas experimentally. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

We analyze the ground state of dipolar bosons by varying the effective on-site interaction. This analysis is performed both numerically and analytically by using suitable coherent-state representations of the ground state. The latter exhibits a variety of forms ranging from the su(3) coherent state in the delocalization regime to a macroscopic cat-like state with fully localized populations, passing for a coexistence regime where the ground state displays a mixed character. We characterize the quantum correlations of the ground state from the bi-partition perspective. We calculate both numerically and analytically (within the previous coherent-state representation) the single-site entanglement entropy which, among various interesting properties, exhibits a maximum value in correspondence to the transition from the cat-like to the coexistence regime. In the latter case, we show that the ground-state mixed form corresponds, semiclassically, to an energy exhibiting two almost-degenerate minima. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

The solitons' excitation spectra reveal the potential existence of a second anomalous mode. While the first such mode describes the soliton oscillatory motion in a parabolic trap, the second, when present, reflects the double well structure of the underlying single-particle spectrum. This novel mode results in moving density stripes in the vicinity of the soliton core, or in an out-of-phase oscillation of the constituent components, with little effect on the nearly stationary striped total density of the composite soliton. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS)"

Incorporation of a designable slab mirror into the conventional vertical cavity, when operating in the strong-coupling regime, enables confinement, control and coupling of polariton gasses in a scalable fashion.

Adhikari;  Trapped degenerate dipolar Bose and Fermi gases of cylindrical symmetry with the polarization vector along the symmetry axis are only stable for the strength of dipolar interaction below a critical value. In the case of bosons, the stability of such a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) is investigated for different strengths of contact and dipolar interactions using variational approximation and numerical solution of a mean-field model. In the disk shape, with the polarization vector perpendicular to the plane of the disk, the atoms experience an overall dipolar repulsion and this fact should contribute to the stability. However, a complete numerical solution of the dynamics leads to the collapse of a strongly disk-shaped dipolar BEC due to the long-range anisotropic dipolar interaction. In the case of fermions, the stability of a trapped single-component degenerate dipolar Fermi gas is studied including the Hartree-Fock exchange and Brueckner-Goldstone correlation energies in the local density approximation valid for a large number of atoms.

Assuming smoothness of the frequency dependent shear viscosity eta(omega), we show that the bound is violated in the low temperature regime and the violation occurs simultaneously with the onset of the Cooper paring in the system. In order to preserve the hydrodynamic bound in QMC eta(omega) has to possess a sharp structure located in the vicinity of zero frequency which is not resolved by an analytic continuation procedure. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)"

A special emphasis is placed on an anomalous hysteresis behavior, in which the phase transition occurs in a unidirectional way and a hysteresis loop does not form. We first revisit the hardcore Bose-Hubbard model with dipole-dipole interactions on a triangular lattice to analyze accurately the ground-state phase diagram and the hysteresis using the cluster mean-field theory combined with cluster-size scaling. Details of the anomalous hysteresis are presented. We next consider the two-component and spin-1 Bose-Hubbard models on a hypercubic lattice and show that the anomalous hysteresis can emerge in these systems as well. In particular, for the former model, we discuss the experimental feasibility of the first-order transitions and the associated hysteresis. We also explain an underlying mechanism of the anomalous hysteresis by means of the Ginzburg-Landau theory. From the given cases, we conclude that the anomalous hysteresis is a ubiquitous phenomenon of systems with a phase region of lobe shape that is surrounded by the first-order boundary. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)"

A phase in which the fully polarized condensate occupies zero momentum is identified. This zero-momentum phase competes with the spin density wave phase when interspecies interaction is stronger than intraspecies interaction, and the former one is always the ground state for weak spin-orbit coupling. When the energies of these two phases are close, there is a phase separation between them. At finite temperature, such a zero-momentum condensation can be induced by a ferromagnetic phase transition in normal state. The spontaneous spin polarization removes the degeneracy of quasiparticles' energy minima, and consequently the modified density of state accommodates a Bose condensation to appear below a critical temperature. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

Wright,  Marcos Rigol;  In general, isolated integrable quantum systems have been found to relax to an apparent equilibrium state in which the expectation values of few-body observables are described by the generalized Gibbs ensemble. However, recent work has shown that relaxation to such a generalized statistical ensemble can be precluded by localization in a quasiperiodic lattice system. Here we undertake complementary single-particle and many-body analyses of noninteracting spinless fermions and hard-core bosons within the Aubry-Andre model to gain insight into this phenomenon. Our investigations span both the localized and delocalized regimes of the quasiperiodic system, as well as the critical point separating the two. Considering first the case of spinless fermions, we study the dynamics of the momentum distribution function and characterize the effects of real-space and momentum-space localization on the relevant single-particle wave functions and correlation functions. We show that although some observables do not relax in the delocalized and localized regimes, the observables that do relax in these regimes do so in a manner consistent with a recently proposed Gaussian equilibration scenario, whereas relaxation at the critical point has a more exotic character. We also construct various statistical ensembles from the many-body eigenstates of the fermionic and bosonic Hamiltonians and study the effect of localization on their properties. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)"

Zinner;  The nature of strongly interacting Fermi gases and magnetism is one of the most important and studied topics in condensed-matter physics. Still, there are many open questions. A central issue is under what circumstances strong short-range repulsive interactions are enough to drive magnetic correlations. Recent progress in the field of cold atomic gases allows to address this question in very clean systems where both particle numbers, interactions and dimensionality can be tuned. Here we study fermionic few-body systems in a one dimensional harmonic trap using a new rapidly converging effective-interaction technique, plus a novel analytical approach. This allows us to calculate the properties of a single spin-down atom interacting with a number of spin-up particles, a case of much recent experimental interest. Our findings indicate that, in the strongly interacting limit, spin-up and spin-down particles want to separate in the trap, which we interpret as a microscopic precursor of one-dimensional ferromagnetism in imbalanced systems. Our predictions are directly addressable in current experiments on ultracold atomic few-body systems. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

Using a combination of analytical and numerical methods, we demonstrate the stabilization of critical quantum liquids with qualitatively new features with respect to the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid paradigm. These features result from frustration and cluster formation in the corresponding classical ground-state. Characteristic signatures of these liquids are accessible in state-of-the-art experimental setups with Rydberg-dressed ground-state atoms trapped in optical lattices. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

The combination of Bose statistics and the symmetry of the p-orbital wave functions leads to a nonintegrable Heisenberg model with antiferromagnetic couplings. Moreover, the sign and relative strength of the couplings characterizing the model are shown to be experimentally tunable. We display the rich phase diagram in the one-dimensional case and discuss finite size effects relevant for trapped systems. Finally, experimental issues related to preparation, manipulation, detection, and imperfections are considered. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

Judd;  We show that magnetic dipolar interactions can stabilize superfluidity in atomic gases but the dipole alignment direction required to achieve this varies, depending on whether the flow is oscillatory or continuous. If a condensate is made to oscillate through a lattice, damping of the oscillations can be reduced by aligning the dipoles perpendicular to the direction of motion. However, if a lattice is driven continuously through the condensate, superfluid behavior is best preserved when the dipoles are aligned parallel to the direction of motion. We explain these results in terms of the formation of topological excitations and tunnel barrier heights between lattice sites. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

Exact diagonalization calculations demonstrate that repulsive interactions between the two species drives ferromagnetic correlations. The ejection probability of an atom provides an experimental probe of the spin correlations. With more than five atoms trapped, the system approaches the itinerant Stoner limit.

We use exact diagonalization and complementary analytic calculations to demonstrate that two trapped fermions deliver a minimal model of the direct exchange mechanism. This is an ideal quantum simulator of the Heisenberg antiferromagnet, exposes the competition between covalent and ionic bonding, and can create, manipulate, and detect quantum entanglement. Three trapped atoms form a faithful simulator of the double exchange mechanism that is the fundamental building block behind many Heisenberg ferromagnets. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)"

Starting from the extended Thomas-Fermi density functional theory of superfluid order parameter, a density transformation is used to map the hydrodynamic mean field equation to a Lienard type equation. As a result, bell solitons are obtained as exact solutions, which is further verified by the numerical solution of the dynamical equation. The stability of the soliton is established and its behaviour in the entire crossover domain is obtained. It is found that, akin to the case of vortices, the bell solitons yield highest contrast in the BEC regime. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.3605;Fingerprinting Rotons in a Dipolar Condensate: Super-Poissonian Peak in  the Atom-Number Fluctuations; R. N. Bisset,  P. B. Blakie;  We demonstrate that measurements of atom-number fluctuations in a trapped dipolar condensate can reveal the presence of the elusive roton excitation. The key signature is a super-Poissonian peak in the fluctuations as the size of the measurement cell is varied, with the maximum occurring when the size is comparable to the roton wavelength. The magnitude of this roton feature is enhanced with temperature. The variation in fluctuations across the condensate demonstrates that the roton excitations are effectively confined to propagate in the densest central region, realizing a density trapped roton gas. While our main results are based on full numerical solutions of the meanfield equations, we also develop and validate a simple local density theory. Finally, we consider fluctuations measured within a washer-shaped cell which filters out the contribution of modes with nonzero angular momentum and provides a signal sensitive to individual roton modes. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

This phase is separated from the ordinary Mott insulator (MI) and density-wave (DW) phases by continuous transitions, whose field theoretical description is here reviewed. Using this technique, we compute the absorption spectrum to two types of periodic perturbations and relate the findings to the nature of the critical excitations at the transition between the different phases. The HI-MI phase transition is topological and the critical excitations possess trivial quantum numbers: they correspond to particles and holes at zero momentum. Our findings are corroborated by a non-local mean-field approach, which allows us to directly relate the predicted spectrum to the known microscopic theory. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.3926;FFLO or Majorana superfluids: The fate of fermionic cold atoms in  spin-orbit coupled optical lattices; Chunlei Qu,  Ming Gong,  Chuanwei Zhang;  The recent experimental realization of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) for ultra-cold atoms opens a completely new avenue for exploring new quantum matter. In experiments, the SOC is implemented simultaneously with a Zeeman field. Such spin-orbit coupled Fermi gases are predicted to support Majorana fermions with non-Abelian exchange statistics in one dimension (1D). However, as shown in recent theory and experiments for 1D spin-imbalanced Fermi gases, the Zeeman field can lead to the long-sought Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superfluids with non-zero momentum Cooper pairings, in contrast to the zero momentum pairing in Majorana superfluids. Therefore a natural question to ask is which phase, FFLO or Majorana superfluids, will survive in spin-orbit coupled Fermi gases in the presence of a large Zeeman field. In this paper, we address this question by studying the mean field quantum phases of 1D (quasi-1D) spin-orbit coupled fermionic cold atom optical lattices. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

This situation was not foreseen because excitons are light-mass boson-like particles with a condensation expected to occur around a few Kelvins. An explanation can be found in the underlying fermionic nature of excitons which rules their condensation. Precisely, it was recently predicted that, at accessible experimental conditions, the exciton condensate shall be ""gray"" with a dominant dark part coherently coupled to a weak bright component through fermion exchanges. This counter-intuitive quantum condensation, since excitons are mostly known for their optical activity, directly follows from the excitons internal structure which has an optically inactive, i.e., dark, ground state. Here, we report compelling evidence for such a ""gray"" condensate. We use an all-optical approach in order to produce microscopic traps which confine a dense exciton gas that yet exhibits an anomalously weak photo-emission at sub-Kelvin temperatures. This first fingerprint for a ""gray"" condensate is then confirmed by the macroscopic spatial coherence and the linear polarization of the weak excitonic photoluminescence emitted from the trap, as theoretically predicted.

For the continuous combined symmetry, the total spin rotation about the rotating axis is restricted to $2\pi$, whereas for the discrete combined symmetry, we further need 2F quantum numbers to characterize the total spin rotation for the spin-$F$ system. For lattice phases we find that in the ground state the topological charge for each unit cell vanishes. However, we find two types of highly symmetric lattices with a nontrivial topological charge in the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ system based on the symmetry classification, and show that they are skyrmion crystals. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

When g > g' on the other hand, we find the phase separation; In a region where one component is present, the other two components must vanish, where we find ghost vortices in these two components whose positions are separated.

At half filling, a quantum phase transition from a semimetal to a superfluid is found for large SOC. Close to half filling where the emerging Dirac cones governs the behaviors of the system, SOC tends to suppress the BCS superfluidity. Conversely, SOC can significantly enhance both the pairing gap and condensate fraction and lead to a new BCS-BEC crossover for small fillings. Moreover, we demonstrate that the superfluid fraction also exhibits many interesting phenomena compared with the spin-orbit coupled Fermi gas without lattice. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

To this end, we prepare ensembles of independent 1D Bose gases in a two-dimensional optical lattice and perform high-resolution in situ imaging of the column-integrated density distribution. Using an inverse Abel transformation we derive effective one-dimensional line-density profiles and compare them to exact theoretical models. The high resolution allows for a direct thermometry of the trapped ensembles.

Spin turbulence (ST) is characterized by a -7/3 power law in the spectrum of the spin-dependent interaction energy. The direction of the spin density vector is spatially disordered but temporally frozen in ST, showing some analogy with the spin glass state. Thus, we introduce the order parameter of spin glass into ST in spinor BECs. When ST develops through some instability, the order parameter grows with a -7/3 power law, thus succeeding in describing ST well. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.4826;Leading-Order Auxiliary Field Theory of the Bose-Hubbard Model; John F. Dawson,  Fred Cooper,  Chih-Chun Chien,  Bogdan Mihaila;  We discuss the phase diagram of the Bose-Hubbard (BH) model in the leading-order auxiliary field (LOAF) theory. LOAF is a conserving non-perturbative approximation that treats on equal footing the normal and anomalous density condensates. The mean-field solutions in LOAF correspond to first-order and second-order phase transition solutions with two critical temperatures corresponding to a vanishing Bose-Einstein condensate, $T_c$, and a vanishing diatom condensate, $T^\star$. The \emph{second-order} phase transition solution predicts the correct order of the transition in continuum Bose gases. For either solution, the superfluid state is tied to the presence of the diatom condensate related to the anomalous density in the system. In ultracold Bose atomic gases confined on a three-dimensional lattice, the critical temperature $T_c$ exhibits a quantum phase transition, where $T_c$ goes to zero at a finite coupling. The BH phase diagram in LOAF features a line of first-order transitions ending in a critical point beyond which the transition is second order while approaching the quantum phase transition. We identify a region where a diatom condensate is expected for temperatures higher than $T_c$ and less than $T_0$, the critical temperature of the non-interacting system. The LOAF phase diagram for the BH model compares qualitatively well with existing experimental data and results of \emph{ab initio} Monte Carlo simulations. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

The coherence of such spin transport in spintronic circuits is determined by the lifetime of spin excitations and by spin diffusion. Fermionic quantum gases are a unique system to study the fundamentals of spin transport from first principles since interactions can be precisely tailored and the dynamics is on time scales which are directly observable. In particular at unitarity, spin transport is dictated by diffusion and is expected to reach a universal, quantum-limited diffusivity on the order of hbar/m. Here, we study the non-equilibrium dynamics of a two-dimensional Fermi gas following a quench into a metastable, transversely polarized spin state. Using the spin-echo technique, we measure the yet lowest transverse spin diffusion constant of 0.25(3) hbar/m. For weak interactions, we observe a coherent collective transverse spin-wave mode that exhibits mode softening when approaching the hydrodynamic regime. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

We focus on higher-nodal axial modes, which in contrast to the elementary modes have received little attention so far. We show how these modes can be efficiently excited using a resonant local excitation scheme and sensitively analyzed by a Fourier transformation of the detected time evolution of the axial density profile. We study the temperature dependence of the mode frequencies across the superfluid phase transition. The behavior is qualitatively different from the elementary modes, where the mode frequencies are independent of the temperature as long as the gas stays in the hydrodynamic regime. Our results are compared to theoretical predictions based on Landau's two-fluid theory and available experimental knowledge of the equation of state. The comparison shows excellent agreement and thus both represents a sensitive test for the validity of the theoretical approach and provides an independent test of the equation of state. The present results obtained on modes of first-sound character represent benchmarks for the observation of second-sound propagation and corresponding oscillation modes. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)"

Due to the long-range nature of the cavity-mediated interactions, but also the presence of a driving laser and dissipative processes such as cavity photon loss, the quantum optical realization of glassy physics has no analog in condensed matter, and could evolve into a ""cavity glass microscope"" for frustrated quantum systems out-of-equilibrium. Here we develop the non-equilibrium theory of the multimode Dicke model with quenched disorder and Markovian dissipation. Using a unified Keldysh path integral approach, we show that the defining features of a low temperature glass, representing a critical phase of matter with algebraically decaying temporal correlation functions, are seen to be robust against the presence of dissipation due to cavity loss. The universality class however is modified due to the Markovian bath. The presence of strong disorder leads to an enhanced equilibration of atomic and photonic degrees of freedom, including the emergence of a common low-frequency effective temperature. The imprint of the atomic spin glass physics onto a ""photon glass"" makes it possible to detect the glass state by standard experimental techniques of quantum optics. We provide an unambiguous characterization of the superradiant and glassy phases in terms of fluorescence spectroscopy, homodyne detection, and the temporal photon correlation function $g^{(2)}(\tau)$.

The universal properties of systems consisting of up to four particles are determined by extrapolating the finite-range energies to the zero-range limit. We determine the eigen energies of states with vanishing and finite momentum. In the weakly-attractive BCS regime, we analyze the energy spectra and degeneracies using first-order degenerate perturbation theory. Excellent agreement between the perturbative energy shifts and the numerically determined energies is obtained.

Bagnato;  After over a decade of experiments generating and studying the physics of quantized vortices in atomic gas Bose-Einstein condensates, research is beginning to focus on the roles of vortices in quantum turbulence, as well as other measures of quantum turbulence in atomic condensates. Such research directions have the potential to uncover new insights into quantum turbulence, vortices and superfluidity, and also explore the similarities and differences between quantum and classical turbulence in entirely new settings. Here we present a critical assessment of theoretical and experimental studies in this emerging field of quantum turbulence in atomic condensates. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.5454;Universal behaviour of four-boson systems from a functional  renormalisation group; Benjamin Jaramillo Avila,  Michael C. Birse (University of Manchester);  We apply a functional renormalisation group to systems of four bosonic atoms close to the unitary limit. We work with a local effective action that includes a dynamical trimer field and we use this field to eliminate structures that do not correspond to the Faddeev-Yakubovsky equations. In the physical limit, we find three four-body bound states below the shallowest three-body state. The values of the scattering lengths at which two of these states become bound are in good agreement with exact solutions of the four-body equations and experimental observations. The third state is extremely shallow. During the evolution we find an infinite number of four-body states based on each three-body state which follow a double-exponential pattern in the running scale. None of the four-body states shows any evidence of dependence on a four-body parameter. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Atomic and Molecular Clusters (physics.atm-clus)"

Here we report on the experimental realisation of tunable staggered gauge fields in a periodically driven triangular lattice. For maximal staggered magnetic fluxes, the doubly degenerate superfluid ground state breaks both a discrete Z2 (Ising) symmetry and a continuous U(1) symmetry. By measuring an Ising order parameter, we observe a thermally driven phase transition from an ordered antiferromagnetic to an unordered paramagnetic state and textbook-like magnetisation curves. Both the experimental and theoretical analysis of the coherence properties of the ultracold gas demonstrate the strong influence of the Z2 symmetry onto the condensed phase. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

Using exact diagonalization, we show that a bosonic analogue of an integer quantum Hall state with no intrinsic topological order appears at the total filling factor \nu=1+1 when the strengths of intracomponent and intercomponent interactions are comparable with each other. This provides a prime example of a symmetry-protected topological phase in a controlled setting of quantum gases. The real-space entanglement spectrum of this state is found to be comprised of counter-propagating chiral modes consistent with the edge theory derived from the effective Chern-Simons theory. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)"

Das;  We propose a mechanism to use nonlinearity arising from inter-particle interactions to significantly enhance rotation sensitivity of matter-wave interferometers. The method relies on modifying Sagnac interferometers by introducing a weak circular lattice potential that couples modes with opposite orbital angular momenta (OAM). The primary observable comprises of the modal population distributions measured at particular times. This provides an alternate mechanism for rotation sensing that requires substantially smaller ring size, even in the linear non-interacting regime. Nonlinearity can improve the sensitivity, as well as operation timescales, by several orders of magnitude. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

It is shown numerically with classical field simulations that an interacting Bose gas with proliferating vortices exhibits long correlation times for these intensity fluctuations. This behavior is contrasted with the case of a noninteracting gas, that we describe analytically, and with the case of a well condensed Bose gas without vortices.

We show that the phase diagram of the system is substantially affected by the anharmonicity of the lattice potential. In particular, for a certain range of tunneling strength, the full many-body ground state of the system becomes degenerate. In this region, an additional symmetry of the system, namely the parity of the occupation number of the chosen orbital, is spontaneously broken. The state with nonvanishing staggered angular momentum, which breaks the time-reversal symmetry, becomes the true ground state of the system. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

Cazalilla;"  We study the stability of a Bose-Fermi system loaded into an array of coupled one-dimensional (1D) ""tubes"", where bosons and fermions experience different dimensions: Bosons are heavy and strongly localized in the 1D tubes, whereas fermions are light and can hop between the tubes. Using the 174Yb-6Li system as a reference, we obtain the equilibrium phase diagram. We find that, for both attractive and repulsive interspecies interaction, the exact treatment of 1D bosons via the Bethe ansatz implies that the transitions between pure fermion and any phase with a finite density of bosons can only be first order and never continuous, resulting in phase separation in density space. In contrast, the order of the transition between the pure boson and the mixed phase can either be second or first order depending on whether fermions are allowed to hop between the tubes or they also are strictly confined in 1D. We discuss the implications of our findings for current experiments on 174Yb-6Li mixtures as well as Fermi-Fermi mixtures of light and heavy atoms in a mixed dimensional optical lattice system.

Lichtenegger;  We present a theoretical study of the dynamic structure function of a resonantly interacting two-component Fermi gas at zero temperature. Our approach is based on dynamic many-body theory able to describe excitations in strongly correlated Fermi systems. The fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo method is used to produce the ground-state correlation functions which are used as an input for the excitation theory. Our approach reproduces recent Bragg scattering data in both the density and the spin channel. In the BCS regime, the response is close to that of the ideal Fermi gas. On the BEC side, the Bose peak associated with the formation of dimers dominates the density channel of the dynamic response. When the fraction of dimers is large our theory departs from the experimental data, mainly in the spin channel. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.6980;Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in a photonic lattice; Guohai Situ,  Stefan Muenzel,  Jason W. Fleischer;  Phase transitions give crucial insight into many-body systems, as crossovers between different regimes of order are determined by the underlying dynamics. These dynamics, in turn, are often constrained by dimensionality and geometry. For example, in one- and two-dimensional systems with continuous symmetry, thermal fluctuations prevent the formation of long-range order[1,2]. Two-dimensional systems are particularly significant, as vortices can form in the plane but cannot tilt out of it. At high temperatures, random motion of these vortices destroys large-scale coherence. At low temperatures, vortices with opposite spin can pair together, cancelling their circulation and allowing quasi-long-range order to appear. This Berezenskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition[3,4] is essentially classical, arising for example in the traditional XY model for spins, but to date experimental evidence has been obtained only in cold quantum systems. Measurements of superfluid sound speed[5] and critical velocity[6] have been consistent with scaling predictions, and vortices have been observed directly in cold atom experiments[7,8]. However, the presence of trapping potentials restricts measurement to vortex density, rather than number, and obscures the process of vortex unbinding. Further, atom and fluid experiments suffer from parasitic heating and difficulties in phase recording, leading to results that differ from theory in many quantitative aspects. Here, we use a nonlinear optical system to directly observe the ideal BKT transition, including vortex pair dynamics and the correlation properties of the wavefunction, for both repulsive and attractiveinteractions (the photonic equivalent of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic conditions[9]). The results confirm the thermodynamics of the BKT transition and expose outstanding issues in the crossovers to superfluidity and Bose-Einstein condensation. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

Jin;  Recent measurements of Efimov resonances in a number of ultracold atom species have revealed an unexpected universality, in which three-body scattering properties are determined by the van der Waals length of the two-body interaction potential. To investigate whether this universality extends to heteronuclear mixtures, we measure loss rate coefficients in an ultracold trapped gas of $^{40}$K and $^{87}$Rb atoms. We find an Efimov-like resonance in the rate of inelastic collisions between $^{40}$K$^{87}$Rb Feshbach molecules and $^{87}$Rb atoms. However, we do not observe any Efimov-related resonances in the rates of inelastic collisions between three atoms. These observations are compared to previous measurements by the LENS group of Efimov resonances in a $^{41}$K and $^{87}$Rb mixture as well as to recent predictions. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.7022;Geometric Stability Spectra of Dipolar Bose Gases in Tunable Optical  Lattices; John P. Corson,  Ryan M. Wilson,  John L. Bohn;  We examine the stability of quasi-two-dimensional dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates in the presence of weak optical lattices of various geometries. We find that when the condensate possesses a roton-maxon quasiparticle dispersion, the conditions for stability exhibit a strong dependence both on the lattice geometry and the polarization tilt. This results in rich structures in the system's stability diagram akin to spectroscopic signatures. We show how these structures originate from the mode matching of rotons to the perturbing lattice. In the case of a one-dimensional lattice, some of the features emerge only when the polarization axis is tilted into the plane of the condensate. Our results suggest that the stability diagram may be used as a novel means to spectroscopically measure rotons in dipolar condensates. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

Close to a $J_g=0\to J_e=1$ atomic transition, and for atomic lattices containing up to $N\approx 3\times10^4$ atoms, we show how the density of states can be affected by both the shape of the system and the possible presence of a fraction of unoccupied lattice sites. We numerically predict and theoretically explain the presence of shape-induced border states and of vacancy-induced localized states appearing in the gap. We also investigate the penetration depth of the electromagnetic field which we compare to the case of an infinite system. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

Benedict;  The quasiparticle excitation spectra of a Bose gas trapped in a highly anisotropic trap is studied with respect to varying total number of particles by numerically solving the effective one-dimensional (1D) Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation proposed recently by Mateo \textit{et al.}. We obtain the static properties and Bogoliubov spectra of the system in the high energy domain. This method is computationally efficient and highly accurate for a condensate system undergoing a 1D to three-dimensional (3D) cigar-shaped transition, as is shown through a comparison our results with both those calculated by the 3D-GP equation and analytical results obtained in limiting cases. We identify the applicable parameter space for the effective 1D-GP equation and find that this equation fails to describe a system with large number of atoms. We also identify that the description of the transition from 1D Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) to 3D cigar-shaped BEC using this equation is not smooth, which highlights the fact that for a finite value of $a_\perp/a_s$ the junction between the 1D and 3D crossover is not perfect. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.7565;Dynamics of spin-1 bosons in an optical lattice: spin mixing, quantum  phase revival spectroscopy and effective three-body interactions; K. W. Mahmud,  E. Tiesinga;  We study the dynamics of spin-1 atoms in a periodic optical-lattice potential and an external magnetic field in a quantum quench scenario where we start from a superfluid ground state in a shallow lattice potential and suddenly raise the lattice depth. The time evolution of the non-equilibrium state, thus created, shows collective collapse-and-revival oscillations of matter-wave coherence as well as oscillations in the spin populations. We show that the complex pattern of these two types of oscillations reveals details about the superfluid and magnetic properties of the initial many-body ground state. Furthermore, we show that the strengths of the spin-dependent and spin-independent atom-atom interactions can be deduced from the observations. The Hamiltonian that describes the physics of the final deep lattice not only contains two-body interactions but also effective multi-body interactions, which arise due to virtual excitations to higher bands. We derive these effective spin-dependent three-body interaction parameters for spin-1 atoms and describe how spin-mixing is affected. Spinor atoms are unique in the sense that multi-body interactions are directly evident in the in-situ number densities in addition to the momentum distributions. We treat both antiferromagnetic (e.g. $^{23}$Na atoms) and ferromagnetic (e.g. $^{87}$Rb and $^{41}$K) condensates. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

We observe Josephson effects, measure the critical current of the junctions, and find dynamic behavior that is in good agreement with the simple Josephson equations for a tunnel junction with the ideal sinusoidal current-phase relation expected for the parameters of the experiment. The junctions and toroidal trap are created with the painted potential, a time-averaged optical dipole potential technique which will allow scaling to more complex BEC circuit geometries than the single atom-SQUID case reported here. Since rotation plays the same role in the atom SQUID as magnetic field does in the dc SQUID magnetometer, the device has potential as a compact rotation sensor. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

We show that, by coupling the two s-wave sublattice superfluid order parameters, a checkerboard potential gives rise to a Hamiltonian that has the form of a two-band superfluidity with three (two intraband and an interband) nonlocal order parameters. We study the evolution of these order parameters as a function of particle filling, interaction strength and checkerboard potential, and find that the system always prefers the 0-phase solutions, i.e. the phase difference between sublattice order parameters is 0, but never the $\pi$-phase one. In addition, we find that the ground-state of the system undergo a superfluid-normal quantum phase transition at half fillings beyond a critical checkerboard potential $C$, the threshold of which is precisely determined by the magnitude of the order parameter at $C = 0$, and that the normal state rapidly turns into a checkerboard insulator as $C$ increases. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el); Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)"

By adopting a two-channel model, we take into account of the closed channel molecules, and show that combined with spin-orbit coupling, a finite background scattering in the open channel can lead to two branches of solution for both the two-body and the many-body ground states. The branching of the two-body bound state solution originates from the avoided crossing between bound states in the open and the closed channels, respectively. For the many-body states, we identify a quantum phase transition in the upper branch regardless of the sign of the background scattering length, which is in clear contrast to the case without spin-orbit coupling. For systems with negative background scattering length in particular, we show that the bound state in the open channel, and hence the quantum phase transition in the upper branch, are induced by spin-orbit coupling. We then characterize the critical detuning of the quantum phase transition for both positive and negative background scattering lengths, and demonstrate the optimal parameters for the critical point to be probed experimentally. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

The non-point character of interaction was taken into account using the Gross equation, which is more general than the Gross-Pitaevskii one. In the framework of this approach, the well-known Bogolyubov dispersion mode \hbar\omega(k)=[(\hbar^{2}k^{2}/2m) ^{2}+qn\nu(k)\hbar^{2}k^{2}/m]^{1/2} (q=1) was obtained, as well as a new one, which is described by the same formula, but with q= 1/2. The new mode emerges owing to the account of boundaries and the non-point character of interaction: this mode is absent when either the Gross equation for a cyclic system or the Gross-Pitaevskii equation for a cyclic system or a system with boundaries is solved. Capabilities for the new mode to be observed are discussed. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

Due to the interplay of SOC and spin-selective interaction, the molecular state intrinsically acquires a non-zero center-of-mass momentum, which results in a new type of Fulde-Ferrell (FF) pairing in spin-orbit coupled Fermi systems. The existence of the Fermi sea can also lead to the competition between FF-like molecular states with different center-of-mass momenta, which corresponds to a first-order transition between FF phases in the thermodynamic limit. As the interaction strength is tuned, a polaron-molecule transition occurs in the highly imbalanced system, where the boundary varies non-monotonically with SOC parameters and gives rise to the reentrance of polaron states. The rich physics in this system can be probed using existing experimental techniques. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

Birgitta Whaley;  We present a path integral Monte Carlo study of the global superfluid fraction and local superfluid density in cylindrically-symmetric reservoirs of liquid $^{4}$He separated by nanoaperture arrays. The superfluid response to both translations along the axis of symmetry (longitudinal response) and rotations about the cylinder axis (transverse response) are computed, together with radial and axial density distributions that reveal the microscopic inhomogeneity arising from the combined effects of the confining external potential and the $^4$He-$^4$He interatomic potentials. We make a microscopic determination of the length-scale of decay of superfluidity at the radial boundaries of the system by analyzing the local superfluid density distribution to extract a displacement length that quantifies the superfluid mass displacement away from the boundary. We find that the longitudinal superfluid response is reduced in reservoirs separated by a septum containing sufficiently small apertures compared to a cylinder with no intervening aperture array, for all temperatures below $T_{\lambda}$. For a single aperture in the septum, a significant drop in the longitudinal superfluid response is seen when the aperture diameter is made smaller than twice the empirical temperature-dependent $^4$He healing length, consistent with the formation of a weak link between the reservoirs. Increasing the diameter of a single aperture or the number of apertures in the array results in an increase of the superfluid density toward the expected bulk value. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

The system displays rich physics from the deep Mott-insulator (MI) all the way to the superfluid (SF) regime. In the deep MI regime, novel spin-ordered phases arise due to the effective Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya type super-exchange interactions. By employing the non-perturbative Bosonic Dynamical Mean-Field-Theory (BDMFT), we numerically study and establish the stability of these magnetic phases against increasing hopping amplitude. We show that as hopping is increased across the MI to SF transition, exotic superfluid phases with magnetic textures emerge. In particular, we identify a new spin-spiral magnetic texture with spatial period 3 in the superfluid close to the MI-SF transition. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

We show that, despite the initial velocity dispersion, the local velocity dispersion defined at a given position downward can reach ultralow values and be used to probe very narrow energetic structures. We explain how one can define quantum mechanically and without ambiguities the different velocity moments at a given position by extension of their classical counterparts. We provide a common theoretical framework for interacting and non-interacting regimes based on the Wigner transform of the initial wave function that encapsulates the dynamics in a scaling parameter. In the absence of interaction, our approach is exact. Using a numerical simulation of the 1D Gross-Pitaevskii equation, we provide the range of validity of our scaling approach and find a very good agreement in the Thomas-Fermi regime. We apply this approach to the study of the scattering of a matter wave packet on a double barrier potential. We show that a Fabry-Perot resonance in such a cavity with an energy width below the pK range can be probed in this manner. We show that our approach can be readily transposed to a large class of many-body quantum systems that exhibit self-similar dynamics. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

It yields to accurate and controlled experiments, and admits the only dynamical microscopic description via time-dependent density functional theory (DFT) - apart from dilute bosonic gases - of the crossing and reconnection of superfluid vortex lines conjectured by Feynman in 1955 to be at the origin of quantum turbulence in superfluids at zero temperature. We demonstrate how various vortex configurations can be generated by using well established experimental techniques: laser stirring and phase imprinting. New imagining techniques demonstrated by the MIT group [Ku et al. arXiv:1402.7052] should be able to directly visualize these crossings and reconnections in greater detail than performed so far in liquid helium. We demonstrate the critical role played by the geometry of the trap in the formation and dynamics of a vortex in the UFG and how laser stirring and phase imprint can be used to create vortex tangles with clear signatures of the onset of quantum turbulence. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

Here we demonstrate the formation of a lattice of vortex-antivortex pairs and study, for the first time, its properties in the non-linear regime at high polarion-density where polariton-polariton interactions dominate the behaviour of the system. In this work first we demonstrate that the array of vortex-antivortex pairs can be generated in a controllable way in terms of size of the array and in terms of size and shape of it fundamental unit cell. Then we demonstrate that polariton-polariton repulsion can strongly deform the lattice unit cell and determine the pattern distribution of the vortex-antivortex pairs, reaching a completely new behaviour with respect to geometrically generated vortex lattices whose shape is determined only by the geometry of the system. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.1281;Antiferromagnetic long-range order in dissipative Rydberg lattices; Michael Hoening,  Wildan Abdussalam,  Michael Fleischhauer,  Thomas Pohl;  We study the dynamics of dissipative spin lattices with power-law interactions, realized via few-level atoms driven by coherent laser-coupling and decoherence processes. Using Monte-Carlo simulations, we determine the phase diagram in the steady state and analyze the dynamics of its generation. As opposed to mean-field predictions and nearest-neighbour models there is no phase transition to long-range ordered phases for realistic interactions and resonant driving. However, for finite laser detunings, we demonstrate the emergence of crystalline order with a vanishing dissipative gap. Although the found steady states differ considerably from those of an equilibrium Ising magnet, the critical exponent of the revealed dissipative phase transition falls into the 2D Ising universality class. Two complementary schemes for an experimental implementation with cold Rydberg atoms are discussed. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph)"

Attributed to a convenient momentum representation, it became a common condition of agreement to express the bound state as a function of the center-of-mass momentum Q. In this letter we prove that the bound state of Rashba fermions does not depend on the chosen representation. That is, all the states characterized by nonzero Q fail to obey the translation symmetry. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.1319;Non-equilibrium transport in $d$-dimensional non-interacting Fermi gases; Mario Collura,  Gabriele Martelloni;  We consider a non-interacting Fermi gas in $d$ dimensions, both in the non-relativistic and relativistic case. The system of size $L^{d}$ is initially prepared into two halves $\mathcal{L}$ and $\mathcal{R}$, each of them thermalized at two different temperatures, $T_{\mathcal{L}}$ and $T_{\mathcal{R}}$ respectively. At time $t=0$ the two halves are put in contact and the entire system is left to evolve unitarily. We show that, in the thermodynamic limit, the time evolution of the particle and energy densities is perfectly described by a semiclassical approach which permits to analytically evaluate the correspondent stationary currents. In particular, in the case of non-relativistic fermions, we find a low-temperature behavior for the particle and energy currents which is independent from the dimensionality $d$ of the system, being proportional to the difference $T_{\mathcal{L}}^{2}-T_{\mathcal{R}}^{2}$. Only in one spatial dimension ($d=1$), the results for the non-relativistic case agree with the massless relativistic ones. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)"

We show that, in contrast to dark solitons in conservative systems, these nonlinear excitations ""relax"" by blending with the background at a finite time, which critically depends on the parameters of the condensate. Our analytical results for trajectory and lifetime are in excellent agreement with direct numerical simulations of the open-dissipative mean-field model. In addition, we show that transverse instability of quasi-one-dimensional dark stripes in a two-dimensional open-dissipative condensate demonstrates features that are entirely absent in conservative systems, as creation of vortex-antivortex pairs competes with the soliton relaxation process.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.1788;Dimerized Mott insulators in hexagonal optical lattices; Ole Jürgensen,  Dirk-Sören Lühmann;  We study bosonic atoms in optical honeycomb lattices with anisotropic tunneling and find dimerized Mott insulator phases with fractional filling. These incompressible insulating phases are characterized by an interaction-driven localization of particles in respect to the individual dimers and large local particle-number fluctuations within the dimers. We calculate the ground-state phase diagrams and the excitation spectra using an accurate cluster mean-field method. The cluster treatment enables us to probe the fundamental excitations of the dimerized Mott insulator where the excitation gap is dominated by the intra-dimer tunneling amplitude. This allows the distinction from normal Mott insulating phases gapped by the on-site interaction. In addition, we present analytical results for the phase diagram derived by a higher-order strong-coupling perturbative expansion approach. By computing finite lattices with large diameters the influence of a harmonic confinement is discussed in detail. It is shown that a large fraction of atoms forms the dimerized Mott insulator under experimental conditions. The necessary anisotropic tunneling can be realized either by periodic driving of the optical lattice or by engineering directly a dimerized lattice potential. The dimers can be mapped to to their antisymmetric states creating a lattice with coupled p-orbitals. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

At medium velocity the head on collision of two such solitons is found to be quasi elastic with practically no deformation. A proposal for creating dipolar dark-in-bright solitons in laboratories by phase imprinting is also discussed. A rich variety of such solitons can be formed in dipolar binary BEC, where one can have a dark-in-bright soliton coupled to a bright soliton or two coupled dark-in-bright solitons. The findings are illustrated using numerical simulation in three spatial dimensions employing realistic interaction parameters for a dipolar 164Dy BEC and a binary 164Dy-162Dy BEC. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS)"

The electron gas optical susceptibility is calculated numerically using the method devised by Combescot and Nozi\`eres. The role of many-body effects, such as the Fermi edge singularity and Anderson orthogonality catastrophe, in the polariton formation is elucidated. By tuning the light-matter coupling the short time behaviour of the electron gas response function is probed and comparison with earlier results only using the long time response are made. Various single particle polariton properties such as the Rabi splitting, line shape, Hopfield coefficients and effective mass are discussed. These are experimentally accessible quantities and thus allow for a comparison with the presented theory. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.2250;Number squeezed and fragmented states of strongly interacting bosons in  a double well; Joel C. Corbo,  Jonathan L. DuBois,  K. Birgitta Whaley;  We present a systematic study of the phenomena of number squeezing and fragmentation for a repulsive Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in a three dimensional double well potential over a range of interaction strengths and barrier heights, including geometries that exhibit appreciable overlap in the one-body wavefunctions localized in the left and right wells. We compute the properties of the condensate with numerically exact, full dimensional path integral ground state (PIGS) Quantum Monte Carlo simulations and compare with results obtained from using two- and eight-mode truncated basis models. The truncated basis models are found to agree with the numerically exact PIGS simulations for weak interactions, but fail to correctly predict the amount of number squeezing and fragmentation exhibited by the PIGS simulations for strong interactions. We find that both number squeezing and fragmentation of the BEC show non-monotonic behavior at large values of interaction strength a. The number squeezing shows a universal scaling with the product of number of particles and interaction strength (Na) but no such universal behavior is found for fragmentation. Detailed analysis shows that the introduction of repulsive interactions not only suppresses number fluctuations to enhance number squeezing, but can also enhance delocalization across wells and tunneling between wells, each of which may suppress number squeezing. This results in a dynamical competition whose resolution shows a complex dependence on all three physical parameters defining the system: interaction strength, number of particles, and barrier height. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

Birgitta Whaley;  We present path integral ground state (PIGS) quantum Monte Carlo calculations for the ground state ($T = 0$) properties of repulsively interacting bosons in a three-dimensional external double well potential over a range of interaction strengths and potential parameters. We focus our calculations on ground state number statistics and the one-body density matrix in order to understand the level of squeezing and fragmentation that the system exhibits as a function of interaction strength. We compare our PIGS results to both a two-mode model and a recently-proposed eight-mode model. For weak interactions, the various models agree with the numerically exact PIGS simulations. However, the models fail to correctly predict the amount of squeezing and fragmentation exhibited by the PIGS simulations for strong interactions. One novel and somewhat surprising result from our simulations involves the relationship between squeezing and interaction strength: rather than a monotonic relationship between these quantities, we find that for certain barrier heights the squeezing increases as a function of interaction strength until it reaches a maximum, after which it decreases again. We also see a similar relationship between fragmentation and interaction strength. We discuss the physical mechanisms that account for this behavior and the implications for the design of atom interferometers, which can use squeezed states to reduce measurement uncertainty. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.2286;Dynamics of noisy quantum systems in the Heisenberg picture: application  to the stability of fractional charge; Armin Rahmani;  Based on the Heisenberg-picture analog of the master equation, we develop a method for computing the exact time dependence of noise-averaged observables for general noninteracting fermionic systems with noisy fluctuations. Upon noise averaging, these fluctuations generate effective interactions, limiting analytical approaches. While the short-time dynamics can be studied with Langevin-type numerical simulations, the long-time limit is not amenable to such simulations. Our results provide access to this long-time limit. As a simple example, we examine the fate of the fractional charge in cold-atom emulations of polyacetylene after stochastic driving. We find that in a quantum quench to a fluctuating hopping Hamiltonian, the fractional charge remains robust for hopping between different sublattices, while it becomes unstable in the presence of noisy hopping on the same sublattice. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Disordered Systems and Neural Networks (cond-mat.dis-nn); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)"

Phillips,  Simone De Liberato;  Transitions between the two states of an AC Stark-split doublet are forbidden in centro-symmetric systems, and thus almost impossible to observe in experiments performed with atomic clouds. However, electrons trapped in nanoscopic heterostructures can behave as artificial atoms, with the advantage that the wavefunction symmetry can be broken by using asymmetric confining potentials. Here we develop the many-body theory describing the intra-doublet emission of a resonantly pumped intersubband transition in a doped asymmetric quantum well, showing that in such a system the intra-doublet emission can be orders of magnitude higher than in previously studied systems. This emission channel, which lies in the terahertz range, and whose frequency depends upon the pump power, opens the way to the realization of a new class of monolithic and tunable terahertz emitters. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.2442;Gapless topological Fulde-Ferrell superfluidity induced by in-plane  Zeeman field; Hui Hu,  Lin Dong,  Ye Cao,  Han Pu,  Xia-Ji Liu;  Topological superfluids are recently discovered quantum matters that host topologically protected gapless edge states known as Majorana fermions - exotic quantum particles that act as their own anti-particles and obey non-Abelian statistics. Their realizations are believed to lie at the heart of future technologies such as fault-tolerant quantum computation. To date, the most efficient scheme to create topological superfluids and Majorana fermions is based on the Sau-Lutchyn-Tewari-Das Sarma model with a Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling on the }\textbf{\textit{x-y}}\textbf{ plane and a large out-of-plane (perpendicular) Zeeman field along the }\textbf{\textit{z}}\textbf{-direction. Here we propose an alternative setup, where the topological superfluid phase is driven by applying an in-plane Zeeman field. This scheme offers a number of new features, notably Cooper pairings at finite centre-of-mass momentum (i.e., Fulde-Ferrell pairing) and gapless excitations in the bulk. As a result, a novel gapless topological quantum matter with inhomogeneous pairing order parameter appears. It features unidirected Majorana surface states at boundaries, which propagate in the same direction and connect two Weyl nodes in the bulk. We demonstrate the emergence of such an exotic topological matter and the associated Majorana fermions in spin-orbit coupled atomic Fermi gases and determine its parameter space. The implementation of our scheme in semiconductor/superconductor heterostructures is briefly discussed. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el); Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

In liquid helium and dilute gases, Bose and Fermi superfluidity has been observed separately, but producing a mixture in which both the fermionic and the bosonic components are superfluid is challenging. Here we report on the observation of such a mixture with dilute gases of two Lithium isotopes, 6Li and 7Li. We probe the collective dynamics of this system by exciting center-of-mass oscillations that exhibit extremely low damping below a certain critical velocity. Using high precision spectroscopy of these modes we observe coherent energy exchange and measure the coupling between the two superfluids. Our observations can be captured theoretically using a sum-rule approach that we interpret in terms of two coupled oscillators. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

A simple model that takes into account the extension of the inter-particle potential is introduced. The correction to the GPE predictions for the energy of a condensate confined by a harmonic trap in the Thomas-Fermi (TF) regime is estimated. Although it is found to be small, we believe that in some situations it can be measured using its dependance on the frequency of the confining trap. Due to the simplicity of the model, it may have a wide range of applications. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)"

In this report, we reveal unconventional pairings induced by spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in a one-dimensional optical lattice, using a state-of-the-art density-matrix renormalization group method. When both bands are partially occupied, we find a strong competition between the interband Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) and intraband Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) pairings. In particular, for the weak and moderate SOC strengths, these two pairings can coexist, giving rise to a new phase called the FFLO-BCS phase, which exhibits a unique three-peak structure in pairing momentum distribution. For the strong SOC strength, the intraband BCS pairing always dominates in the whole parameter regime, including the half filling. We figure out the whole phase diagrams as functions of filling factor, SOC strength, and Zeeman field. Our results are qualitatively different from recent mean-field predictions. Finally, we address that our predictions could be observed in a weaker trapped potential. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

By using the extended BCS equations and the concept of off-diagonal-long-range-order we derive a formula for the condensate number of Cooper pairs as a function of energy gap, average chemical potential, imbalance chemical potential and temperature. Then we study the zero-temperature condensate fraction of Cooper pairs by varying interaction strength and polarization, finding a depletion of the condensate fraction by increasing the population imbalance. We also consider explicitly the presence of an external harmonic confinement and we study, within the local-density approximation, the phase separation between superfluid and normal phase regions of the polarized fermionic cloud. In particular, we calculate both condensate density profiles and total density profiles from the inner superfluid core to the normal region passing for the interface, where a finite jump in the density is a clear manifestation of this phase-separated regime. Finally, we compare our theoretical results with the available experimental data on the condensate fraction of polarized 6Li atoms [Science 311, 492 (2006)]. These experimental data are in reasonable agreement with our predictions in a suitable range of polarizations, but only in the BCS side of the crossover up to unitarity. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

We show that various few-body states in vacuum composed of the impurity and background gas atoms (single impurity, dimer, trimer, tetramer) give rise to corresponding dressed states ({\em polaron}, {\em dimeron}, {\em trimeron}, {\em tetrameron}) in the gas and inherit many of their characteristics. We study the ground state focussing on the choice of wave function and its properties. We raise a few unsolved problems: whether the polaron and dimeron are really separate branches, what other few-body states might exist, the nature of the groundstate for large numbers of particle-hole pairs and why is the polaron ansatz so good. We then turn to the excited states, and to the calculation of the effective mass. We examine the bounds on the effective mass and raise a conjecture about that of composite quasiparticle states. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Atomic and Molecular Clusters (physics.atm-clus); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

We prove rigorously that the superfluid critical velocity is zero when the impurity moves in all but one directions, in contrast to the case of liquid helium and superconductor where it is finite in all directions. We also find that when the impurity moves in all directions except two special ones, the drag force has nonzero transverse component at small velocity. When the velocity becomes large and the states of the upper band are also excited, the transverse force becomes very small due to opposite contributions of the two bands. The characteristics of the superfluid critical velocity and the transverse force are results of the order by disorder mechanism in spin-orbit coupled boson systems. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

We show that the rate is well defined and can be described by two-body parameters only: the scattering length $a$ and the effective range $R_e$. We find the rate to be energy independent, and, by connecting our results with previously reported measurements in the universal limit, we cover the behavior of the three-body recombination in the whole range from weak to strong two-body interactions. We identify a nontrivial magnetic field value in the nonuniversal regime where the rate should be strongly reduced. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

This dynamical regime is characterized by uncompensated phonon production and a super-diffusive, universal scaling of quasiparticle lifetimes with momentum $\sim q^{-5/3}$, distinct from finite and zero temperature cases. It is separated from a high momentum regime by a time dependent scale fading out as $q_0(t) \sim t^{-4/5}$. In the latter region we observe thermalization to an effective time-dependent equilibrium with linearly increasing temperature. By mapping out the dynamical phase diagram and computing the dynamical structure factor within an open system Keldysh functional integral approach, we show how these predictions can be explored in cold atom experiments by means of Bragg spectroscopy. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

In the strong interaction regime, we develop an analytical theory for understanding the sideband transitions, which is confirmed by our numerical simulation.

Both methods allow us to determine the sign of the quantized circulation. Experimental observations agree with numerical simulations. These solitonic vortices are the decay product of phase defects of the BEC order parameter spontaneously created after a rapid quench across the BEC transition in a cigar-shaped harmonic trap and are shown to have a very long lifetime. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.4280;Nonsmooth and level-resolved dynamics illustrated with the tight binding  model; J. M. Zhang,  Masudul Haque;  We point out that in the first order time-dependent perturbation theory, the transition probability may behave nonsmoothly in time and have kinks periodically. Moreover, the detailed temporal evolution can be sensitive to the exact locations of the eigenvalues in the continuum spectrum, in contrast to coarse-graining ideas. Underlying this nonsmooth and level-resolved dynamics is a simple equality about the sinc function $\sinc x \equiv \sin x / x$. These physical effects appear in many systems with approximately equally spaced spectra, and is also robust for larger-amplitude coupling beyond the domain of perturbation theory. We use a one-dimensional periodically driven tight-binding model to illustrate these effects, both within and outside the perturbative regime. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

Gangardt;"  In a recent paper, arxiv:1402.6362, Gamayun, Lychkovskiy, and Cheianov studied the dynamics of a mobile impurity embedded into a one-dimensional Tonks-Girardeau gas of strongly interacting bosons. Employing the Boltzmann equation approach, they arrived at the following main conclusions: (i) a light impurity, being accelerated by a constant force does not exhibit Bloch oscillations; (ii) a heavy impurity does undergo Bloch oscillations, accompanied by a drift with the velocity proportional to the square root of force. In this comment we argue that the result (i) is an artifact of the classical Boltzmann approximation, which misses the formation of the (quasi) bound-state between the impurity and a hole. Result (ii), while not valid at asymptotically small force, indeed reflects an interesting intermediate-force behavior. Here we clarify its limits of applicability and extend beyond the Tonks-Girardeau limit. ";Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

Dalibard;  Driving a quantum system periodically in time can profoundly alter its long-time dynamics and trigger topological order. Such schemes are particularly promising for generating non-trivial energy bands and gauge structures in quantum-matter systems. Here, we develop a general formalism that captures the essential features ruling the dynamics: the effective Hamiltonian, but also the effects related to the initial phase of the modulation and the micro-motion. This framework allows for the identification of driving schemes, based on general N-step modulations, which lead to configurations relevant for quantum simulation. In particular, we explore methods to generate synthetic spin-orbit couplings and magnetic fields in cold-atom setups. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.4500;Effect of spin-orbit interaction on the critical temperature of an ideal  Bose gas; Arunesh Roy,  Sayak Ray,  S. Sinha;  We consider Bose-Einstein condensation of an ideal bose gas with an equal mixture of `Rashba' and `Dresselhaus' spin-orbit interactions and study its effect on the critical temperature. In uniform bose gas a `cusp' and a sharp drop in the critical temperature occurs due to the change in the density of states at a critical Raman coupling where the degeneracy of the ground states is lifted. Relative drop in the critical temperature depends on the diluteness of the gas as well as on the spin-orbit coupling strength. In the presence of a harmonic trap, the cusp in the critical temperature smoothened out and a minimum appears. Both the drop in the critical temperature and lifting of `quasi-degeneracy' of the ground states exhibit crossover phenomena which is controlled by the trap frequency. By considering a 'Dicke' like model we extend our calculation to bosons with large spin and observe a similar minimum in the critical temperature near the critical Raman frequency, which becomes deeper for larger spin. Finally in the limit of infinite spin, the critical temperature vanishes at the critical frequency, which is a manifestation of Dicke type quantum phase transition. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

Barenghi;  The study of vortex reconnections is an essential ingredient of understanding superfluid turbulence, a phenomenon recently also reported in trapped atomic Bose-Einstein condensates. In this work we show that, despite the established dependence of vortex motion on temperature in such systems, vortex reconnections are actually temperature independent on the typical length/time scales of atomic condensates. Our work is based on a dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii equation for the condensate, coupled to a semiclassical Boltzmann equation for the thermal cloud (the Zaremba-Nikuni-Griffin formalism). Comparison to vortex reconnections in homogeneous condensates further show reconnections to be insensitive to the inhomogeneity in the background density. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)"

The diffusion of wave packets in the pulsed optical lattice exhibits either extended or localized behaviors, which can be well characterized by the mean square displacement and the spatial correlation function. We show that the dynamical localization transition is relevant to both the strength of incommensurate potential and the kicked period, and the transition point can be revealed by the information entropy of eigenfunctions of the Floquet propagator. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5075;Solitons in a hard-core bosonic system: Gross-Pitaevskii type and beyond; Radha Balakrishnan,  Indubala I Satija;  A unified formulation that obtains solitary waves for various background densities in the Bose-Einstein condensate of a system of hard-core bosons with nearest neighbor attractive interactions is presented. In general, two species of solitons appear: A nonpersistent (NP) type that fully delocalizes at its maximum speed, and a persistent (P) type that survives even at its maximum speed, and transforms into a periodic train of solitons above this speed. When the background condensate density is nonzero, both species coexist, the soliton is associated with a constant intrinsic frequency, and its maximum speed is the speed of sound. In contrast, when the background condensate density is zero, the system has neither a fixed frequency, nor a speed of sound. Here, the maximum soliton speed depends on the frequency, which can be tuned to lead to a cross-over between the NP-type and the P-type at a certain critical frequency, determined by the energy parameters of the system. We provide a single functional form for the soliton profile, from which diverse characteristics for various background densities can be obtained. Using the mapping to spin systems enables us to characterize the corresponding class of magnetic solitons in Heisenberg spin chains with different types of anisotropy, in a unified fashion. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5233;Renormalization theory of a two dimensional Bose gas: quantum critical  point and quasi-condensed state; Serena Cenatiempo,  Alessandro Giuliani;  We present a renormalization group construction of a weakly interacting Bose gas at zero temperature in the two-dimensional continuum, both in the quantum critical regime and in the presence of a condensate fraction. The construction is performed within a rigorous renormalization group scheme, borrowed from the methods of constructive field theory, which allows us to derive explicit bounds on all the orders of renormalized perturbation theory. Our scheme allows us to construct the theory of the quantum critical point completely, both in the ultraviolet and in the infrared regimes, thus extending previous heuristic approaches to this phase. For the condensate phase, we solve completely the ultraviolet problem and we investigate in detail the infrared region, up to length scales of the order $(\lambda^3 \rho_0)^{-1/2}$ (here $\lambda$ is the interaction strength and $\rho_0$ the condensate density), which is the largest length scale at which the problem is perturbative in nature. We exhibit violations to the formal Ward Identities, due to the momentum cutoff used to regularize the theory, which suggest that previous proposals about the existence of a non-perturbative non-trivial fixed point for the infrared flow should be reconsidered. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)"

Glaetzle,  Marcello Dalmonte,  Rejish Nath,  Ioannis Rousochatzakis,  Roderich Moessner,  Peter Zoller;  Quantum spin ice represents a paradigmatic example on how the physics of frustrated magnets is related to gauge theories. In the present work we address the problem of approximately realizing quantum spin ice in two dimensions with cold atoms in optical lattices. The relevant interactions are obtained by weakly admixing van der Waals interactions between laser admixed Rydberg states to the atomic ground state atoms, exploiting the strong angular dependence of interactions between Rydberg p-states together with the possibility of designing step-like potentials. This allows us to implement Abelian gauge theories in a series of geometries, which could be demonstrated within state of the art atomic Rydberg experiments. We numerically analyze the family of resulting microscopic Hamiltonians and find that they exhibit both classical and quantum order by disorder, the latter yielding a quantum plaquette valence bond solid. We also present strategies to implement Abelian gauge theories using both s- and p-Rydberg states in exotic geometries, e.g. on a 4-8 lattice. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

Kezerashvili,  Yoshihisa Yamamoto;  Dipolaritons are a three-way superposition of photon, a direct exciton, and an indirect exciton that are formed in coupled quantum well microcavities. As is the case with exciton-polaritons, dipolaritons have a self-interaction due to direct and exchange effects of the underlying electrons and holes. Here we present a theoretical description of dipolaritons and derive simple formulas for their basic parameters. In particular, we derive the effective dipolariton-dipolariton interaction taking into account of exchange effects between the excitons. We obtain a simple relation to describe the effective interaction at low densities. We find that dipolaritons should condense under suitable conditions, described by a dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii equation. While the parameters for condensation are promising, we find that the level of tunability of the interactions is limited. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)"

Through spatially resolved sideband spectroscopy following the imaging sequence, we demonstrate the efficacy of this imaging technique in various regimes of lattice depth and fluorescence acquisition rate. Our work provides an important extension of quantum gas imaging to the nondestructive detection, control and manipulation of atoms in optical lattices. In addition, our technique can also be extended to atomic species that are less amenable to molasses-based lattice imaging. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

Bruun;  The rapid progress in the production and cooling of molecular gases indicates that experimental studies of quantum gases with a strong dipolar interaction is soon within reach. Dipolar gases are predicted to exhibit very rich physics including quantum liquid crystal phases such as density-waves as well as superfluid phases, both of which play an important role for our understanding of strongly correlated systems. Here, we investigate the zero temperature properties of the density-wave phase of a two-dimensional (2D) system of fermonic dipoles using a conserving Hartree-Fock theory. We calculate the amplitude of the density waves as a function of the dipole moment and orientation with respect to the 2D plane. The stripes give rise to a 1D Brillouin zone structure, and the corresponding quasiparticle spectrum is shown to have gapped as well as gapless regions around the Fermi surface. As a result, the system remains compressible in the density-wave phase, and it collapses for strong attraction. We show that the density-waves has clear signatures in the momentum distribution and in the momentum correlations. Both can be measured in time-of-flight experiments. Finally, we discuss how the striped phase can be realised with experimentally available systems. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el); Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)"

However, its experimental observation remains elusive since the emergent energy gap is too small. We show that a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate is an excellent candidate for the observation of such a peculiar phenomenon as the energy gap turns out to be 2 orders of magnitude larger than the zero-point energy. This extraordinarily large energy gap is a consequence of the dynamical instability. The propagation velocity of the resultant massive excitation mode is found to be decreased by the quantum corrections as opposed to phonons. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

However, the FFLO states have not been observed experimentally in Fermi gases in three dimensions (3D), possibly due to their small phase space volume and extremely low temperature required for an equal-mass Fermi gas. Here we explore possible effects of mass imbalance, mainly in a $^6$Li--$^{40}$K mixture, on the one-plane-wave FFLO phases for a 3D homogeneous case at the mean-field level. We present various phase diagrams related to the FFLO states at both zero and finite temperatures, throughout the BCS-BEC crossover, and show that a large mass ratio may enhance substantially FFLO type of pairing. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el); Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)"

Depending on the values of the parameters describing the periodic modulation, the number of created pairs either oscillates or, in a narrow resonant frequency interval, grows exponentially in time. For a system initially in a thermal state, we determine in which cases the final state is quantum mechanically entangled, i.e., where the bipartite state is nonseparable. We include some weak dissipation, expected to be found in any experimental setup, and study the corresponding reduction of the quantum entanglement.

We find that the three-body repulsion hardly affects the qualitative features of the Mott transition, because the three-body repulsion does not compete with the two-body repulsions. When the three-body repulsion is extremely strong, the triple occupancy vanishes in the Fermi liquid state. This situation is equivalent to that caused by strong three-body losses. Our results imply that three-body losses have little influence on the Mott transitions in the repulsively interacting three-component fermionic atoms in optical lattices. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)"

When pair tunneling is strong enough, the ground state wavefunction predicted by the MFT is complex and doubly degenerate while the quantum ground state wavefunction is always real and unique. The time reversal symmetry is spontaneously broken when the system transfers from the quantum ground state into one of the mean field ground states upon a small perturbation. As the gap between the lowest two levels decreases exponentially with particle number, the required perturbation inducing the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) is infinitesimal for particle number of typical cold atom systems. The quantum ground state is further analyzed with the Penrose-Onsager criterion, and is found to be a fragmented condensate. The state also develops the pair correlation and has non-vanishing pair order parameter instead of the conventional single particle order parameter. When this model is generalized to optical lattice, a pair superfluid can be generated. The mean field ground state can be regarded as effective ground state in this simple model. The detailed computation for this model enables us to offer an in-depth discussion of the relation between SSB and effective ground state, giving a glimpse on how nonlinearity arises in the SSB of a quantum system. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.6400;Observation of Quantized Conductance in Neutral Matter; Sebastian Krinner,  David Stadler,  Dominik Husmann,  Jean-Philippe Brantut,  Tilman Esslinger;  In transport experiments the quantum nature of matter becomes directly evident when changes in conductance occur only in discrete steps, with a size determined solely by Planck's constant h. The observations of quantized steps in the electric conductance have provided important insights into the physics of mesoscopic systems and allowed for the development of quantum electronic devices. Even though quantized conductance should not rely on the presence of electric charges, it has never been observed for neutral, massive particles. In its most fundamental form, the phenomenon requires a quantum degenerate Fermi gas, a ballistic and adiabatic transport channel, and a constriction with dimensions comparable to the Fermi wavelength. Here we report on the observation of quantized conductance in the transport of neutral atoms. We employ high resolution lithography to shape light potentials that realize either a quantum point contact or a quantum wire for atoms. These constrictions are imprinted on a quasi two-dimensional ballistic channel connecting two adjustable reservoirs of quantum degenerate fermionic lithium atoms. By tuning either a gate potential or the transverse confinement of the constrictions, we observe distinct plateaus in the conductance for atoms. The conductance in the first plateau is found to be equal to 1/h, the universal conductance quantum. For low gate potentials we find good agreement between the experimental data and the Landauer formula, with all parameters determined a priori. Our experiment constitutes the cold atom version of a mesoscopic device and can be readily extended to more complex geometries and interacting quantum gases. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)"

The second order transport coefficients describe the shear stress relaxation time, non-linear terms in the strain-stress relation, and non-linear couplings between vorticity and strain. An exact calculation in the dilute limit gives $\tau_R=\eta/P$, where $\tau_R$ is the shear stress relaxation time, $\eta$ is the shear viscosity, and $P$ is pressure. This relation is identical to the result obtained using the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) approximation to the collision term, but other transport coefficients are sensitive to the exact collision integral. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)"

At equilibrium, the ground state of the system can undergo a topological phase transition and become a topological superfluid with Majorana edge states. As the interaction is quenched near the topological phase boundary, we identify an interesting dynamical phase transition of the quenched state in the long-time limit, characterized by an abrupt change of the pairing gap at a critical quenched interaction strength. We further demonstrate the topological nature of this dynamical phase transition from edge-state analysis of the quenched states. Our findings provide interesting clues for the understanding of topological phase transitions in dynamical processes, and can be useful for the dynamical detection of Majorana edge states in corresponding systems. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

We demonstrate how it may be used to compute spatial mode entanglement, particle partitioned entanglement, and the entanglement of particles, providing insights into quantum correlations generated by fluctuations, indistinguishability and interactions. We present proof-of-principle calculations, and benchmark against an exactly soluble model of interacting bosons in one spatial dimension. As this algorithm retains the fundamental polynomial scaling of quantum Monte Carlo when applied to sign-problem-free models, future applications should allow for the study of entanglement entropy in large scale many-body systems of interacting bosons. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

Using the variational method we show that there is an enhancement of the condensate stability due to the inclusion of a three-body interaction in addition to the two-body interaction. We also study the stability of the condensates in the presence of the time-varying three-body interaction. Finally we confirm the stabilization of a trapless condensate from numerical simulation. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.7248;Aspects of Floquet Bands and Topological Phase Transitions in a  Continuously Driven Superlattice; Longwen Zhou,  Hailong Wang,  Derek Y.H. Ho,  Jiangbin Gong;  Recently the creation of novel topological states of matter by a periodic driving field has attracted great attention. To motivate further experimental and theoretical studies, we investigate interesting aspects of Floquet bands and topological phase transitions in a continuously driven Harper model. In such a continuously driven system with an odd number of Floquet bands, the bands are found to have nonzero Chern numbers in general and topological phase transitions take place as we tune various system parameters, such as the amplitude or the period of the driving field. The nontrivial Floquet band topology results in a quantized transport of Wannier states in the lattice space. For certain parameter choices, very flat yet topologically nontrivial Floquet bands may also emerge, a feature that is potentially useful for the simulation of physics of strongly correlated systems. Some cases with an even number of Floquet bands may also have intriguing Dirac cones in the spectrum. Under open boundary conditions, anomalous counter-propagating chiral edge modes and degenerate zero modes are also found as the system parameters are tuned. These results should be of experimental interest because a continuously driven system is easier to realize than a periodically kicked system. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.7337;Efimov spectrum in bosonic systems with increasing number of particles; A. Kievsky,  M. Gattobigio,  N.K. Timofeyuk;  It is well-known that three-boson systems show the Efimov effect when the two-body scattering length $a$ is large with respect to the range of the two-body interaction. This effect is a manifestation of a discrete scaling invariance (DSI). In this work we study DSI in the $N$-body system by analysing the spectrum of $N$ identical bosons obtained with a pairwise gaussian interaction close to the unitary limit. We consider different universal ratios such as $E_N^0/E_3^0$ and $E_N^1/E_N^0$, with $E_N^i$ being the energy of the ground ($i=0$) and first-excited ($i=1$) state of the system, for $N\le16$. We discuss the extension of the Efimov radial law, derived by Efimov for $N=3$, to general $N$. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)"

Hilliard,  Jan J. Arlt;  We have investigated spin dynamics in a 2D quantum gas. Through spin-changing collisions, two clouds with opposite spin orientations are spontaneously created in a Bose-Einstein condensate. After ballistic expansion, both clouds acquire ring-shaped density distributions with superimposed angular density modulations. The density distributions depend on the applied magnetic field and are well explained by a simple Bogoliubov model. We show that the two clouds are anti-correlated in momentum space. The observed momentum correlations pave the way towards the creation of an atom source with non-local Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entanglement. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0230;Theory of Bosons in two-leg ladders with large magnetic fields; Ran Wei,  Erich J. Mueller;"  We calculate the ground state of a Bose gas trapped on a two-leg ladder where Raman-induced hopping mimics the effect of a large magnetic field. In the mean-field limit, where there are large numbers of particles per site, this maps onto a uniformly frustrated two-leg ladder classical spin model. The net particle current always vanishes in the ground state, but generically there is a finite ""chiral current"", corresponding to equal and opposite flow on the two legs. We vary the strength of the hopping across the rungs of the ladder and the interaction between the bosons. We find three phases: (1) A ""saturated chiral current phase"" (SCCP), where the density is uniform and the chiral current is simply related to the strength of the magnetic field. In this state the only broken symmetry is the $U(1)$ condensate phase. (2) A ""biased ladder phase"" (BLP), where the density is higher on one leg than the other. The fluid velocity is higher on the lower density leg, so the net current is zero. In addition to the $U(1)$ condensate phase, this has a broken $Z_2$ reflection symmetry. (3) A ""modulated density phase"" (MDP), where the atomic density is modulated along the ladder. In addition to the $U(1)$ condensate phase, this has a second broken $U(1)$ symmetry corresponding to translations of the density wave. We further study the fluctuations of the condensate in the BLP, finding a roton-maxon like excitation spectrum. Decreasing the hopping along the rungs softens the spectrum. As the energy of the ""roton"" reaches to zero, the BLP becomes unstable. We describe the experimental signatures of these phases, including the response to changing the frequency of the Raman transition. ";"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

The spin current destroys the spin polarization, leading to a sudden onset of two-body collisions. In addition, the spin coherence, as measured by the fringe contrast using Ramsey interferometry, is reduced drastically but experiences a weak revival due to in-trap oscillations. The spin current can be controlled using periodic $\pi$ pulses (bang-bang control), producing longer spin coherence times. Our results show that spin coherence can be maintained even in the presence of spin currents, with applications to quantum sensing in noisy environments. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

We study the Hubbard model on a square lattice with single impurities, pairs of nearby impurities, or lines of impurities using numerically exact determinantal quantum Monte Carlo simulations. In all cases, correlations on the ""impurity"" sites are enhanced either by larger on-site interactions or by a reduced coupling to the environment. We find highly nontrivial magnetic correlations, which persist at elevated temperatures and should be accessible in cold-atom systems with current experimental techniques. With improved cooling techniques, these features could be followed towards generic quantum antiferromagnetism in the homogeneous limit. More generally, tunable crossing points between different correlation functions could be used, in a quantum steelyard balance setup, as robust thermometers.

By solving the Bogoliubov-de-Gennes equations, we obtain the phase diagram at given chemical potential and order parameter. We show that the system undergoes a phase transition from Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer superfluid to topological superfluid as increasing the intensity of Zeeman field. By comparing to the two-component system, we find, besides the topological phase transition from the trivial superfluid to nontrivial topological superfluid, the system can always be in a nontrivial topological superfluid, and there are two Majorana zero energy regions while increasing the magnetic field. We find the three-component spin-orbit-coupled Fermi gases in certain parameter range is more optimizing for experimental realization due to the smaller magnetic field needed. We therefore propose a promising candidate for realizing topological superfluid. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

Duan,  Tony Scott;  We use the mean-field method, the Quantum Monte-carlo method and the Density matrix renormalization group method to study the trimer superfluid phase and the quantum phase diagram of the Bose-Hubbard model in an optical lattice, with explicit trimer tunneling term. Theoretically, we derive the explicit trimer hopping terms, such as $a_i^{3\dagger}a_j^3$, by the Schrieffer-Wolf transformation. In practice, the trimer super\-fluid described by these terms is driven by photoassociation. The phase transition between the trimer super\-fluid phase and other phases are also studied. Without the on-site interaction, the phase transition between the trimer superfluid phase and the Mott Insulator phase is continuous. Turning on the on-site interaction, the phase transitions are first order with Mott insulators of atom filling $1$ and $2$. With nonzero atom tunneling, the phase transition is first order from the atom superfluid to the trimer superfluid. In the trimer superfluid phase, the win\-ding numbers can be divided by three without any remainders. In the atom superfluid and pair superfluid, the vorticities are $1$ and $1/2$, respectively. However, the vorticity is $1/3$ for the trimer superfluid. The power law decay exponents is $1/2$ for the non diagonal correlation $a_i^{\dagger 3} a_j^{3}$, i.e. the same as the exponent of the correlation $a_i^{\dagger}a_j$ in hardcore bosons. The density dependent atom-tunneling term $n_i^2a_i^{\dagger}a_j$ and pair tunneling term $n_ia_i^{\dagger2}a_j^2$ are also studied. With these terms, the phase transition from the empty phase to atom superfluid is first order and different from the cases without the density dependent terms. The ef\-fects of temperature are studied. Our results will be helpful in realizing the trimer superfluid by a cold atom experiment. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)"

While evaluating the incompressible kinetic energy spectra of the quantum fluid described by the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, a bilinear form in a log-log plot is verified. A characteristic scaling behavior for small momenta shows resemblance to the Kolmogorov $k^{-5/3}$ law, while for large momenta it reassures the universal behavior of the core-size $k^{-3}$ power-law. This indicates a mechanism of energy transportation consistent with an inverse cascade. The feasibility of the described physical system with the currently available experimental techniques to create giant vortices opens up a new route to explore quantum turbulence. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

It is demonstrated that upon free expansion of the gas, the spatial dependence of the density-density correlations at late times provides a unique signature of fragmentation. This hallmark of fragmented condensate many-body states in a single trap is due to the fact that time of flight modifies the correlation signal such that two opposite %with respect to points in the expanding cloud become uncorrelated, in distinction to a nonfragmented Bose-Einstein condensate, where they remain correlated. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

In such a system there is no thermodynamic ground state, but there may be a long-lived steady-state, described as an eigenstate of a ""Floquet Hamiltonian"". We calculate how scattering processes lead to a decay of the Floquet state. We map out the phase diagram of the system and find regions where the BEC is stable and regions where the BEC is unstable against atomic collisions. We show that Parker et al. perform their experiment in the stable region, which accounts for the long life-time of the condensate ($\sim$ 1 second). We also estimate the scattering rate of the bosons in the region where the BEC is unstable. ";"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

Our system consists of an ultracold sample of strongly magnetic $^{167}$Er fermions, spin-polarized in the lowest Zeeman sublevel. In this system, elastic collisions arise purely from universal dipolar scattering. Based on cross-dimensional rethermalization experiments, we observe a strong anisotropy of the scattering, which manifests itself in a large angular dependence of the thermal relaxation dynamics. Our result is in very good agreement with recent theoretical predictions. Furthermore, we measure the rethermalization rate as a function of temperature for different angles and find that the suppression of collisions by Pauli blocking is not influenced by the dipole orientation. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph)"

We study the ground state properties of such a system and show that it can be mapped to the well-known Dicke model in quantum optics, which describes the interactions between an ensemble of atoms and an optical field. A central prediction of the Dicke model is a quantum phase transition between a superradiant phase and a normal phase. Here we detect this transition in a spin-orbit coupled BEC by measuring various physical quantities across the phase transition. These quantities include the spin polarization, the relative occupation of the nearly degenerate single particle states, the quantity analogous to the photon field occupation, and the period of a collective oscillation (quadrupole mode). The applicability of the Dicke model to spin-orbit coupled BECs may lead to interesting applications in quantum optics and quantum information science. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

The deformation is caused by the interplay between strong magnetic dipole-dipole interaction and the Pauli exclusion principle. We demonstrate the many-body nature of the effect and its tunability with the Fermi energy.

Guan,  Qi Zhou;  A central quantity of importance for ultracold atoms is contact, which measures two-body correlations at short distances in dilute systems. It appears in universal relations among thermodynamic quantities, such as large momentum tails, energy, and dynamic structure factors, through the renowned Tan relations. However, a conceptual question remains open as to whether or not contact can signify phase transitions that are insensitive to short-range physics. Here we show that, near a continuous classical or quantum phase transition, contact exhibits a variety of critical behaviors, including scaling laws and critical exponents that are uniquely determined by the universality class of the phase transition and a constant contact per particle. We also use a prototypical exactly solvable model to demonstrate these critical behaviors in one-dimensional strongly interacting fermions. Our work establishes an intrinsic connection between the universality of dilute many-body systems and universal critical phenomena near a phase transition. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

In the paraxial-propagation geometry considered here, the photon-fluid dynamics is described by a wave equation analogous to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation of dilute Bose-Einstein condensates and the obstacle consists in a solid dielectric slab immersed into a nonlinear optical liquid. By means of an ab initio calculation of the electromagnetic force experienced by the obstacle, we anticipate that superfluidity is detectable in state-of-the-art experiments from the disappearance of the optomechanical deformation of the obstacle. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

Gattobigio;  We present the analysis of the $N$-boson spectrum computed using a soft two-body potential the strength of which has been varied in order to cover an extended range of positive and negative values of the two-body scattering length $a$ close to the unitary limit. The spectrum shows a tree structure of two states, one shallow and one deep, attached to the ground-state of the system with one less particle. It is governed by an unique universal function, $\Delta(\xi)$, already known in the case of three bosons. In the three-particle system the angle $\xi$, determined by the ratio of the two- and three-body binding energies $E_3/E_2=\tan^2\xi$, characterizes the Discrete Scale Invariance of the system. Extending the definition of the angle to the $N$-body system as $E_N/E_2=\tan^2\xi$, we study the $N$-boson spectrum in terms of this variable. The analysis of the results, obtained for up to $N=16$ bosons, allows us to extract a general formula for the energy levels of the system close to the unitary limit. Interestingly, a linear dependence of the universal function as a function of $N$ is observed at fixed values of $a$. We show that the finite-range nature of the calculations results in the range corrections that generate a shift of the linear relation between the scattering length $a$ and a particular form of the universal function. We also comment on the limits of applicability of the universal relations. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Atomic and Molecular Clusters (physics.atm-clus); Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

To study magnetic phenomena one needs to engineer synthetic fields as atoms are neutral. Appropriately shaped optical potentials force atoms to mimic charged particles moving in a given field. We present the realization of artificial gauge fields for the observation of anomalous Hall effect. Two species of attractively interacting ultracold fermions are considered to be trapped in a shaken two dimensional triangular lattice. A combination of interaction induced tunneling and shaking can result in an emergent Dice lattice. In such a lattice the staggered synthetic magnetic flux appears and it can be controlled with external parameters. The obtained synthetic fields are non-Abelian. Depending on the tuning of the staggered flux we can obtain either anomalous Hall effect or its quantized version. Our results are reminiscent of Anomalous Hall conductivity in spin-orbit coupled ferromagnets. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.2979;Dynamics of localized waves in 1D random potentials: statistical theory  of the coherent forward scattering peak; Kean Loon Lee,  Benoît Grémaud,  Christian Miniatura;  As recently discovered [PRL ${\bf 109}$ 190601(2012)], Anderson localization in a bulk disordered system triggers the emergence of a coherent forward scattering (CFS) peak in momentum space, which twins the well-known coherent backscattering (CBS) peak observed in weak localization experiments. Going beyond the perturbative regime, we address here the long-time dynamics of the CFS peak in a 1D random system and we relate this novel interference effect to the statistical properties of the eigenfunctions and eigenspectrum of the corresponding random Hamiltonian. Our numerical results show that the dynamics of the CFS peak is governed by the logarithmic level repulsion between localized states, with a time scale that is, with good accuracy, twice the Heisenberg time. This is in perfect agreement with recent findings based on the nonlinear $\sigma$-model. In the stationary regime, the width of the CFS peak in momentum space is inversely proportional to the localization length, reflecting the exponential decay of the eigenfunctions in real space, while its height is exactly twice the background, reflecting the Poisson statistical properties of the eigenfunctions. Our results should be easily extended to higher dimensional systems and other symmetry classes. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Disordered Systems and Neural Networks (cond-mat.dis-nn); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

This is specially important for applications which require the solution of a large number of different single-impurity problems, such as the bosonic dynamical mean field theory of disordered systems. In particular, we investigate the connection between spontaneous global gauge symmetry breaking and the occurrence of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC). We show how BEC is accurately signaled by the appearance of broken symmetry, even when a fairly modest number of states is retained. The occurrence of symmetry breaking can be detected both by adding a small conjugate field or, as in generic quantum critical points, by the divergence of the associated phase susceptibility. Our results show excellent agreement with the considerably more demanding numerical renormalization group (NRG) method. We also investigate the mean impurity occupancy and its fluctuations, identifying an asymmetry in their critical behavior across the quantum phase transitions between BEC and `Mott' phases. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3338;Finite range and upper branch effects on itinerant ferromagnetism in  repulsive Fermi gases: Bethe-Goldstone ladder resummation approach; Lianyi He;  We investigate the ferromagnetic transition in repulsive Fermi gases at zero temperature with upper branch and effective range effects. Based on a general effective Lagrangian that reproduces precisely the two-body $s$-wave scattering phase shift, we obtain a nonperturbative expression of the energy density as a function of the polarization by using the Bethe-Goldstone ladder resummation. For hard sphere potential, the predicted critical gas parameter $k_{\rm F}a=0.816$ and the spin susceptibility agree well with the results from fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo calculations. In general, positive and negative effective ranges have opposite effects on the critical gas parameter $k_{\rm F}a$: While a positive effective range reduces the critical gas parameter, a negative effective range increases it. For attractive potential or Feshbach resonance model, the many-body upper branch exhibits an energy maximum at $k_{\rm F}a=\alpha$ with $\alpha=1.34$ from the Bethe-Goldstone ladder resummation, which is qualitatively consistent with experimental results. The many-body T-matrix has a positive-energy pole for $k_{\rm F}a>\alpha$ and it becomes impossible to distinguish the bound state and the scattering state. These positive-energy bound states become occupied and therefore the upper branch reaches an energy maximum at $k_{\rm F}a=\alpha$. In the zero range limit, there exists a narrow window ($0.86<k_{\rm F}a<1.56$) for the ferromagnetic phase. At sufficiently large negative effective range, the ferromagnetic phase disappears. On the other hand, the appearance of positive-energy bound state resonantly enhances the two-body decay rate around $k_{\rm F}a=\alpha$ and may prevent the study of equilibrium phases and ferromagnetism of the upper branch Fermi gas. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)"

At the end of our simulations the system is trapped in a non-thermal state.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.4068;Topological phases in spin-orbit coupled dipolar lattice bosons; H. T. Ng;  We study the topological phases in spin-orbit coupled dipolar bosons in a one-dimensional optical lattice. The magnetic dipolar interactions between atoms give rise to the inter-site interactions. In the Mott-insulating regime, this system can be described by the quantum XYZ spin model with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in a transverse field. We focus on investigating the effect of dipolar interactions on the topological phase. The topological phase can be shown when spin-orbit coupling incorporates with the repulsive dipolar interaction. We find that the dipolar interaction can broaden the range of parameters of spin-orbit coupling and transverse field for exhibiting the topological phase. The sum of spin correlations between the two nearest neighbouring atoms can be used to indicate the topological phase. This may be useful for detecting topological phases in experiments. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.4246;Phase-induced transport in atomic gases: from superfluid to Mott  insulator; Sebastiano Peotta,  Chih-Chun Chien,  Massimiliano Di Ventra;  Recent experimental realizations of artificial gauge fields for cold atoms are promising for generating steady states carrying a mass current in strongly correlated systems, such as the Bose-Hubbard model. Moreover, a homogeneous condensate confined by hard-wall potentials from laser sheets has been demonstrated, which provides opportunities for probing the intrinsic transport properties of isolated quantum systems. Using the time-dependent Density Matrix Renormalization Group (TDMRG), we analyze the effect of the lattice and interaction strength on the current generated by a quench in the artificial vector potential when the density varies from low values (continuum limit) up to integer filling in the Mott-insulator regime. There is no observable mass current deep in the Mott-insulator state as one may expect. Other observable quantities used to characterize the quasi-steady state in the bulk of the system are the Drude weight and entanglement entropy production rate. The latter in particular provides a striking signature of the superfluid-Mott insulator transition. Furthermore, an interesting property of the superfluid state is the formation of shock and rarefaction waves at the boundaries due to the hard-wall confining potentials. We provide results for the height and the speed of the shock front that propagates from the boundary toward the center of the lattice. Our results should be verifiable with current experimental capabilities. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

Simula;  We propose a robust imaging technique that makes it possible to distinguish vortices from antivortices in quasi-two-dimensional Bose--Einstein condensates from a single image of the density of the atoms. Tilting the planar condensate prior to standard absorption imaging excites a generalized gyroscopic mode of the condensate revealing the sign and location of each vortex. This technique is anticipated to enable experimental measurement of the incompressible kinetic energy spectrum of the condensate and the observation of a negative temperature phase transition of the vortex gas, driven by two-dimensional superfluid turbulence. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

The cavity introduces a quantum optical lattice potential which dynamically couples with the atomic degrees of freedom and realizes a generalized extended Bose Hubbard model whose zero temperature phase diagram can be controlled by tuning the cavity parameters. In the non-interacting limit, where the atom-atom interaction is set to zero, the resulting atomic dispersion shows interesting features such as bosonic analogue of Dirac points, cavity controlled Hofstadter spectrum which bears the hallmark of pseudo-spin-1/2 bosons in presence of Abelian and non-Abelian gauge field (the later due to spin-orbit coupling) in a cavity induced optical lattice potential. In the presence of atom-atom interaction, using a mapping to a generalized Bose Hubbard model of spin-orbit coupled bosons in classical optical lattice, we show that the system realizes a host of quantum magnetic phases whose magnetic order can be be detected from the cavity transmission. This provides an alternative approach for detecting quantum magnetism in ultra cold atoms. We discuss the effect of cavity induced optical bistability on this phases and their experimental consequences. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

Morais Smith;  We describe the behavior of a system of fermionic atoms loaded in a bipartite one-dimensional optical lattice that is under the action of an external time-periodic driving force. By using Floquet theory, an effective model with renormalized hopping coefficients is derived. The insulating behavior characterizing the system at half-filling in the absence of driving is dynamically suppressed and for particular values of the driving parameter the system becomes either a standard metal or an unconventional metal with four Fermi points. We use the bosonization technique to investigate the effect of on-site Hubbard interactions on the four Fermi-point metal-insulator phase transition. Attractive interactions are expected to enlarge the regime of parameters where the unconventional metallic phase arises, whereas repulsive interactions reduce it. This metallic phase is known to be a Luther-Emery liquid (spin gapped metal) for both, repulsive and attractive interactions, contrarily to the usual Hubbard model which exhibits a Mott insulator phase for repulsive interactions. Ultracold fermions in driven one-dimensional bipartite optical lattices provide an interesting platform for the realization of this long studied four Fermi-point unconventional metal. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

By integrating a master equation for quantum observables, we calculate how single particle correlations decay. We consider weakly- and strongly- interacting bosons and noninteracting fermions. Even in the Mott regime, such measurements destroy correlations and increase the average energy, as long as some hopping is allowed. We explore the role of spatial resolution, and find that the heating rate is proportional to the amount of information gained from such measurements. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

Rev. B 88, 161101(R) (2013)]. Upon doping away from half-filling, we find several distinct phases, including a phase-separated ferromagnet with Mott behavior for the heavy species and both Mott insulating and superfluid behaviors for the light species. Introducing polarization, an imbalance in the population between species, we find a fully phase-separated ferromagnet. This phase exists for a broad range of temperatures and polarizations. By using finite size scaling of the susceptibility, we find a critical exponent which is consistent with the two-dimensional Ising universality class. Significantly, since the global entropy of this phase is higher than that of the ferromagnetic phase with single species, its experimental observation in cold atoms may be feasible. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.4915;"Looking for ""avalanche-mechanism"" loss at an atom-molecule Efimov  resonance"; Ming-Guang Hu,  Ruth S. Bloom,  Deborah S. Jin,  Jonathan M. Goldwin;"  The ""avalanche mechanism"" has been used to relate Efimov trimer states to certain enhanced atom loss features observed in ultracold atom gas experiments. These atom loss features are argued to be a signature of resonant atom-molecule scattering that occurs when an Efimov trimer is degenerate with the atom-molecule scattering threshold. However, observation of these atom loss features has yet to be combined with the direct observation of atom-molecule resonant scattering for any particular atomic species. In addition, recent Monte-Carlo simulations were unable to reproduce a narrow loss feature. We experimentally search for enhanced atom loss features near an established scattering resonance between 40K87Rb Feshbach molecules and 87Rb atoms. Our measurements of both the three-body recombination rate in a gas of 40K and 87Rb atoms and the ratio of the number loss for the two species do not show any broad loss feature and are therefore inconsistent with theoretical predictions that use the avalanche mechanism.

The dissipation is engineered to stabilize a BEC condensate wave function in its steady state. We then characterize the steady state emerging from the interplay between incompatible Hamiltonian and dissipative dynamics. While it is expected that interactions lead to this competition, even the kinetic energy in an open boundary condition setup competes with the dissipation, leading to a non-trivial steady state. We also present results for the transient dynamics and probe the relaxation time revealing the closing of the dissipative gap in the thermodynamic limit. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.5242;Interaction energy and itinerant ferromagnetism in a strongly  interacting Fermi gas in the absence of molecule formation; Lianyi He;  We investigate the interaction energy and the possibility of itinerant ferromagnetism in a strongly interacting Fermi gas at zero temperature in the absence of molecule formation. The interaction energy is obtained by summing the perturbative contributions of Galitskii-Feynman type to all orders in the gas parameter. It can be expressed by a simple phase space integral of an in-medium scattering phase shift. In both three and two dimensions (3D and 2D), the interaction energy shows a maximum before reaching the resonance from the Bose-Einstein condensate side, which provides a possible explanation of the experimental measurements of the interaction energy. This phenomenon can be theoretically explained by the qualitative change of the nature of the binary interaction in the medium. The appearance of an energy maximum has significant effects on the itinerant ferromagnetism. In 3D, the ferromagnetic transition is reentrant and itinerant ferromagnetism exists in a narrow window around the energy maximum. In 2D, the present theoretical approach suggests that itinerant ferromagnetism does not exist, which reflects the fact that the energy maximum becomes much lower than the energy of the fully polarized state. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)"

We focus on the regime where the number of atoms is very large and perform a two-mode approximation. An analytical solution of the two-site Bose-Hubbard-like Hamiltonian is found for several limiting cases, which range from a strong Raman coupling to a strong Josephson coupling, ending with the complete model in the presence of weak nonlinear interactions. Depending on the particular limit, different approaches are chosen: a mapping onto an SU(2) spin problem together with a Holstein-Primakoff transformation in the first two cases and a rotating wave approximation (RWA) when dealing with the complete model. The quantum evolution of the number difference of bosons with equal or different spin between the two wells is investigated in a wide range of parameters; finally the corresponding total atomic current and the spin current are computed. We show a spin Josephson effect which could be detected in experiments and employed to build up realistic devices. ";Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

The parameter regime ($U$, $V$ and $\mu$) where this phase exists and how it competes with other phases such as the supersolid (SS) phase, is incompletely understood. We use the Stochastic Green Function quantum Monte Carlo algorithm as well as the density matrix renormalization group to map out the phase diagram. Our main conclusions are that the HI exists only at $\rho=1$, the SS phase exists for a very wide range of parameters (including commensurate fillings) and displays power law decay in the one body Green function. In addition, we show that at fixed integer density, the system exhibits phase separation in the $(U,V)$ plane. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

Population inversion, bistable normal phases and the coexistence of normal{superradiant phases are revealed by adjusting of the experimentally realizable interaction strength and pump-laser frequency. For the negative (effective) cavity-frequency we observe remark- ably an inverted quantum phase transition (QPT) from the superradiant to normal phases with the increase of atom-field coupling, which is just opposite to the QPT in the normal Dicke model. The bistable macroscopic states are derived analytically in terms of the spin-coherent-state variational method by taking into account of both normal and inverted pseudospin states. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.5708;Fragmentation of Spin-orbit Coupled Spinor Bose-Einstein Condensates; Shu-Wei Song,  Yi-Cai Zhang,  Hong Zhao,  Xuan Wang,  Wu-Ming Liu;  The fragmentation of spin-orbit coupled spin-1 Bose gas with a weak interaction in external harmonic trap is explored by both exact diagonalization and mean-field theory. This fragmentation tendency, which originates from the total angular momentum conservation, is affected obviously by the spin-orbit coupling strength and the spin-dependent interaction. Strong spin-orbit interaction raises the inverse participation ratio, which describes the number of significantly occupied single-particle states. As the spin-dependent interaction changes from anti-ferromagnetic to ferromagnetic, the peak values in the inverse participation ratio become lower. Without the confinement of the appointed total angular momentum, the condensate chooses a zero or finite total angular momentum ground state, which is determined by both the interaction and the spin-orbit coupling strength. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

We assume that the transport of the superfluid part is hydrodynamic, and we describe the ballistic transport of the normal part using the Landauer-Buttiker formalism. Modeling the coupled evolution of the phase, atom number, and temperature mismatches between the reservoirs, we predict that Helmholtz (plasma) oscillations, induced by an initial imbalance in atom numbers, can be observed at non-zero temperatures below Tc. We show that, because of its strong compressibility, the ultracold Bose gas is characterized by a fast thermalization compared to the damping time for plasma oscillations, accompanied by a fast transfer of the normal component through the constriction. This fast thermalization also affects the gas above Tc, where we present an explicit comparison to the ideal fermionic case. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

When both bound and scattering eigenstates exist in the post-quench Hamiltonian, one might expect partial delocalization of the wave packet to ensue. Here we show that if the quench consists of a sudden switching-off of short-range inter-particle interactions, then Tan's universal relations guarantee delocalization through the high-momentum tail of the momentum distribution. Furthermore, we consider the influence of the range of the interaction and show how a finite range alters the coupling to highly excited states. We illustrate our results using numerical simulations of externally trapped particles in one dimension. If the external potential is both disordered and correlated, then the interaction quench leads to transport via delocalized states, showing that localization in disordered systems is sensitive to non-adiabatic changes in the interactions between particles. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Disordered Systems and Neural Networks (cond-mat.dis-nn); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

The interaction between the impurity and the fermions involves only the partial $s$-wave through the scattering length $a$, and has negligible range $b$ compared to the inverse Fermi wave number $1/\kf$ of the gas. Through the interactions with the Fermi gas the impurity gives birth to a quasi-particle, which will be here a Fermi polaron (or more precisely a {\sl monomeron}). We consider the general case of an impurity moving with wave vector $\KK\neq\OO$: Then the quasi-particle acquires a finite lifetime in its initial momentum channel because it can radiate particle-hole pairs in the Fermi sea. A description of the system using a variational approach, based on a finite number of particle-hole excitations of the Fermi sea, then becomes inappropriate around $\KK=\mathbf{0}$. We rely thus upon perturbation theory, where the small and negative parameter $\kf a\to0^-$ excludes any branches other than the monomeronic one in the ground state (as e.g.\ the dimeronic one), and allows us a systematic study of the system. We calculate the impurity self-energy $\Sigma^{(2)}(\KK,\omega)$ up to second order included in $a$. Remarkably, we obtain an analytical explicit expression for $\Sigma^{(2)}(\KK,\omega)$ allowing us to study its derivatives in the plane $(K,\omega)$. These present interesting singularities, which in general appear in the third order derivatives $\partial^3 \Sigma^{(2)}(\KK,\omega)$. In the special case of equal masses, $M=m$, singularities appear already in the physically more accessible second order derivatives $\partial^2 \Sigma^{(2)}(\KK,\omega)$; using a self-consistent heuristic approach based on $\Sigma^{(2)}$ we then regularise the divergence of the second order derivative $\partial\_K^2 \Delta E(\KK)$ of the complex energy of the quasi-particle found in reference [C. Trefzger, Y. Castin, Europhys. Lett. {\bf 104}, 50005 (2013)] at $K=\kf$, and we predict an interesting scaling law in the neighborhood of $K=\kf$. As a by product of our theory we have access to all moments of the momentum of the particle-hole pair emitted by the impurity while damping its motion in the Fermi sea, at the level of Fermi's golden rule.

This provides an experimental signature of the GGE which may readily be identified through spectroscopy. These signatures are universal and robust to initial sate preparation.

We theoretically characterize this transition when the particles are classical dipoles, polarized perpendicularly to the plane in which the motion occurs, and argue that this transition is of first order, even though weakly. The nature of the transition is determined by the coupling between transverse and axial modes of the chain and contrasts with the behaviour found in Coulomb systems, where the linear-zigzag transition is continuous and belongs to the universality class of the ferromagnetic transition. Our results hold for classical systems with power-law interactions $1/r^\alpha$ when $\alpha > 2$, and show that structural transitions in dipolar systems and Rydberg atoms can offer the testbed for simulating the critical behaviour of magnets with lattice coupling. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)"

This locking persists in the presence of the trapping potential and weak magnetic fields, allowing, in principle, an experimental probe of this correlated spontaneous symmetry breaking, as a macroscopic manifestation of zero-point quantum fluctuations. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

Two systems are studied: liquid helium-4 and the Yukawa Bose-liquid being a model of the nuclear matter. The suggested decoupling in the equations of motion for Green's functions yields a good description of the elementary excitation spectrum in the long-wavelength limit. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.6924;Accurate one-dimensional effective description of realistic matter-wave  gap solitons; A. Muñoz Mateo,  V. Delgado (Univ. La Laguna);  We consider stationary matter-wave gap solitons realized in Bose--Einstein condensates loaded in one-dimensional (1D) optical lattices and investigate whether the effective 1D equation proposed in [Phys. Rev. A \textbf{77}, 013617 (2008)] can be a reliable alternative to the three-dimensional treatment of this kind of system in terms of the Gross--Pitaevskii equation (GPE). Our results demonstrate that, unlike the standard 1D GPE (which is not applicable in most realistic situations), the above effective model is able to correctly predict the distinctive trajectories characterizing the different gap soliton families as well as the corresponding axial wavefunctions along the entire band gaps. It can also predict the stability properties of the different gap soliton families as follows from both a linear stability analysis and a representative set of numerical computations. In particular, by numerically solving the corresponding Bogoliubov--de Gennes equations we show that the effective 1D model gives the correct spectrum of complex eigenfrequencies responsible for the dynamical stability of the system, thus providing us with a useful tool for the physical description of stationary matter-wave gap solitons in 1D optical lattices. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.6941;Nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory for bosonic lattice models; Hugo U. R. Strand,  Martin Eckstein,  Philipp Werner;"  We develop the nonequilibrium extension of bosonic dynamical mean field theory (BDMFT) and a Nambu real-time strong-coupling perturbative impurity solver. In contrast to Gutzwiller mean-field theory and strong coupling perturbative approaches, nonequilibrium BDMFT captures not only dynamical transitions, but also damping and thermalization effects at finite temperature. We apply the formalism to quenches in the Bose-Hubbard model, starting both from the normal and Bose-condensed phases. Depending on the parameter regime, one observes qualitatively different dynamical properties, such as rapid thermalization, trapping in metastable superfluid or normal states, as well as long-lived or strongly damped amplitude oscillations. We summarize our results in non-equilibrium ""phase diagrams"" which map out the different dynamical regimes. ";"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.7030;A quantum Langevin model for non-equilibrium condensation; Alessio Chiocchetta,  Iacopo Carusotto;  We develop a quantum model for non-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensation of photons and polaritons in planar microcavity devices. The model builds upon laser theory and includes the spatial dynamics of the cavity field, a saturation mechanism and some frequency-dependence of the gain: quantum Langevin equations are written for a cavity field coupled to a continuous distribution of externally pumped two-level emitters with a well-defined frequency. As a an example of application, the method is used to study the linearised quantum fluctuations around a steady-state condensed state. In the good-cavity regime, an effective equation for the cavity field only is proposed in terms of a stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii equation. Perspectives in view of a full quantum simulation of the non-equilibrium condensation process are finally sketched. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)"

In the homogeneous case, we find that the Chandrasekhar-Clogston critical polarization for the onset of instability of Fermi superfluidity is enhanced due to the interaction with the bosons. Predictions for the critical polarization are also given in the trapped case, with a special focus to the situation of equal Fermi-Bose and Bose-Bose coupling constants, where the density of fermions becomes flat in the center of the trap. This regime can be realized experimentally using Feshbach resonances and is well suited to investigate the emergence of exotic configurations, such as the occurrence of spin domains or the FFLO phase. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.7336;Light scattering and dissipative dynamics of many fermionic atoms in an  optical lattice; Saubhik Sarkar,  Stephan Langer,  Johannes Schachenmayer,  Andrew J. Daley;  We investigate the many-body dissipative dynamics of fermionic atoms in an optical lattice in the presence of incoherent light scattering. Deriving and solving a master equation to describe this process microscopically for many particles, we observe contrasting behaviour in terms of the robustness against this type of heating for different many-body states. In particular, we find that the magnetic correlations exhibited by a two-component gas in the Mott insulating phase should be particularly robust against decoherence from light scattering, because the decoherence in the lowest band is suppressed by a larger factor than the timescales for effective superexchange interactions that drive coherent dynamics. Furthermore, the derived formalism naturally generalizes to analogous states with SU(N) symmetry. In contrast, for typical atomic and laser parameters, two-particle correlation functions describing bound dimers for strong attractive interactions exhibit superradiant effects due to the indistinguishability of off-resonant photons scattered by atoms in different internal states. This leads to rapid decay of correlations describing off-diagonal long-range order for these states. Our predictions should be directly measurable in ongoing experiments, providing a basis for characterising and controlling heating processes in quantum simulation with fermions. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

In this way the physics of a nonlinear Luttinger liquid may be described in terms of hydrodynamic (i.e. bosonized) variables without recourse to refermionization or the introduction of fictitious impurities. We focus on the calculation of the dynamic structure factor for a model with quadratic dispersion, which has the Benjamin--Ono equation of fluid dynamics as its equation of motion. We find singular behavior in the vicinity of upper and lower energetic thresholds corresponding to phonon and soliton branches of the classical theory, which may be benchmarked against known results for the Calogero--Sutherland model. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.7588;Fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo study of the BCS-BEC crossover in a  bilayer system of fermionic dipoles; Natalia Matveeva,  Stefano Giorgini;  We investigate the BCS-BEC crossover in a bilayer system of fermionic dipoles at zero temperature using the fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo technique. The dipoles are confined on two parallel planes separated by a distance $\lambda$ and are aligned perpendicular to the planes by an external field. The interlayer pairing, which is responsible for the superfluid behavior of the system, crosses from a weak to a strong-coupling regime by reducing the separation distance $\lambda$. For a fixed in-plane density, equal in the two layers, we calculate the ground-state energy, the chemical potential, the pairing gap and the quasiparticle dispersion as a function of the interlayer separation. At large $\lambda$ one recovers the ground-state energy of a single layer of fermions and at small $\lambda$ the one of a single layer of composite bosons with twice the particle mass and the dipole moment. The superfluid gap varies instead from the exponentially small BCS result to half of the large two-body binding energy in the BEC regime of strong interlayer pairing. Results are compared with the predictions of the simplest mean-field theory valid in the low-density limit and deviations are observed both in the BCS regime, where in-plane repulsions are important, and in the BEC regime where the mean-field approach fails to describe the physics of composite dipolar bosons. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

Boronat,  A. Polls;  We present the complete phase diagram for one-dimensional binary mixtures of bosonic ultracold atomic gases in a harmonic trap. We obtain exact results with direct numerical diagonalization for small number of atoms, which permits us to quantify quantum many-body correlations. The quantum Monte Carlo method is used to calculate energies and density profiles for larger system sizes. We study the system properties for a wide range of interaction parameters. For the extreme values of these parameters, different correlation limits can be identified, where the correlations are either weak or strong. We investigate in detail how the correlation evolve between the limits. For balanced mixtures in the number of atoms in each species, the transition between the different limits involves sophisticated changes in the one- and two-body correlations. Particularly, we quantify the entanglement between the two components by means of the von Neumann entropy. We show that the limits equally exist when the number of atoms is increased, for balanced mixtures. Also, the changes in the correlations along the transitions among these limits are qualitatively similar. We also show that, for imbalanced mixtures, the same limits with similar transitions exist. Finally, for strongly imbalanced systems, only two limits survive, i.e., a miscible limit and a phase-separated one, resembling those expected with a mean-field approach. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

Pawlowski;  Scaling in the dynamical properties of complex many-body systems has been of strong interest since turbulence phenomena became the subject of systematic mathematical studies. In this article, dynamical critical phenomena far from equilibrium are investigated with functional renormalisation group equations. The focus is set on scaling solutions of the stochastic driven-dissipative Burgers equation and their relation to solutions known in the literature for Burgers and Kardar-Parisi-Zhang dynamics. We furthermore relate superfluid as well as acoustic turbulence described by the Gross-Pitaevskii model to known analytic and numerical results for scaling solutions. In this way, the canonical Kolmogorov exponent 5/3 for the energy cascade in superfluid turbulence is obtained analytically. We also get first results for anomalous exponents of acoustic and quantum turbulence. These are consistent with existing experimental data. Our results should be relevant for future experiments with, e.g., exciton-polariton condensates in solid-state systems as well as with ultra-cold atomic gases. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)"

These equations are coupled with the Maxwell equations. The model under consideration includes the dipole-dipole, the dipole-quadrupole, and the quadrupole-quadrupole interactions in terms of the electric field created by the dipoles and quadrupoles. We apply this model to obtain the Bogoliubov spectrum for three dimensional BECs with a repulsive short-range interaction. We obtain an extra term in the Bogoliubov spectrum in compare with the dipolar BECs. We show that the quadrupole-quadrupole interaction gives a positive contribution in the Bogoliubov spectrum. Hence this spectrum is stable. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

Malomed,  Tomasz Sowiński,  Jakub Zakrzewski;"  Originally, the Hubbard model has been derived for describing the behaviour of strongly-correlated electrons in solids. However, since over a decade now, variations of it are also routinely being implemented with ultracold atoms in optical lattices. We review some of the rich literature on this subject, with a focus on more recent non-standard forms of the Hubbard model. After an introduction to standard (fermionic and bosonic) Hubbard models, we discuss briefly common models for mixtures, as well as the so called extended Bose-Hubbard models, that include interactions between neighboring sites, next-neighboring sites, and so on. The main part of the review discusses the importance of additional terms appearing when refining the tight-binding approximation on the original physical Hamiltonian. Even when restricting the models to the lowest Bloch band is justified, the standard approach neglects the density-induced tunneling (which has the same origin as the usual on-site interaction). The importance of these contributions is discussed for both contact and dipolar interactions. For sufficiently strong interactions, also the effects related to higher Bloch bands become important even for deep optical lattices. Different approaches that aim at incorporating these effects, mainly via dressing the basis Wannier functions with interactions, leading to effective, density-dependent Hubbard-type models, are reviewed. We discuss also examples of Hubbard-like models that explicitly involve higher $p$-orbitals, as well as models that couple dynamically spin and orbital degrees of freedom. Finally, we review mean-field nonlinear-Schr\""odinger models of the Salerno type that share with the non-standard Hubbard models the nonlinear coupling between the adjacent sites. In that part, discrete solitons are the main subject of the consideration. We conclude by listing some future open problems.

This system is realized by the cold atomic gases in an optical lattice. In particular, we are interested in the strong-repulsion region of two-component gases for which the bosonic t-J model is a good effective model. In the bosonic t-J model, a long-range order of the pseudo-spin and also BEC of atoms appear quite naturally as in the fermion t-J model for the high-temperature superconducting materials. Random Raman scattering between two internal states of a single atom plays a role of the random external field, and we study its effects on the pseudo-spin order and the BEC by means of quantum Monte-Carlo simulations. The random external field breaks a continuous U(1) symmetry existing in the original bosonic t-J model and it induces new orders named random-field-induced order (RFIO). We show a phase diagram of the bosonic t-J model with the random external magnetic field and study the robustness of the RFIO states. We also study topological excitations like vortices and domain wall in the RFIO state. Finally we point out the possibility of a quantum bit by the RFIO. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

Performing exact diagonalization of the Hamiltonian we analyze the ground state and the thermal state of the system in terms of one-- and two--particle reduced density matrices. We show how for strong attraction the correlated pairs emerge in the system. We find that the fraction of correlated pairs depends on temperature and we show that this dependence has universal properties analogous to the gap function known from the theory of superconductivity. In contrast to the standard approach based on the variational ansatz and/or perturbation theory, our predictions are exact and are valid also in a strong attraction limit. Our findings contribute to the understanding of strongly correlated few-body systems and can be verified in current experiments on ultra-cold atoms. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

A frame transformation formalism is introduced, which allows the assignment of measured FRs with only three parameters. All three models achieve a total rms error of < 1G on the observed FRs. We critically compare the different models in view of the accuracy for the description of FRs and the required input parameters for the calculations. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

These solutions represent the quantized dynamics of solitonic degrees of freedom in atomic droplets. In dimensions lower than two, or $d=2-\epsilon$, we demonstrate that the number of isotropic droplet states scales as $N^{3/2}/\epsilon^{1/2}$, and for $\epsilon=0$, or $d=2$, scales as ${N^2}$. The ground state energies scale as $N^{2 / \epsilon + 1}$ in $d=2-\epsilon$, and when $d=2$, scale as an exponential function of N. We obtain the universal energy spectra and the generalized Tjon relation; their scaling properties are uniquely determined by the asymptotic freedom of quantum bosonic fields at short distances, a distinct feature in low dimensions. We also investigate the effect of quantum loop corrections that arise from various virtual processes and show that the resultant lifetime for a wide range of excited states scales as $N^{\epsilon/2}E^{1-\epsilon/2}$.

Wall,  Victor Gurarie,  Ana Maria Rey;  Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in solids normally originates from the electron motion in the electric field of the crystal. It is key to understanding a variety of spin-transport and topological phenomena, such as Majorana fermions and recently discovered topological insulators. Implementing and controlling spin-orbit coupling is thus highly desirable and could open untapped opportunities for the exploration of unique quantum physics. Here, we show that dipole-dipole interactions can produce an effective SOC in two-dimensional ultracold polar molecule gases. This SOC generates chiral excitations with a non-trivial Berry phase $2\pi$. These excitations, which we call \emph{chirons}, resemble low-energy quasiparticles in bilayer graphene and emerge regardless of the quantum statistics and for arbitrary ratios of kinetic to interaction energies. Chirons manifest themselves in the dynamics of the spin density profile, spin currents, and spin coherences, even for molecules pinned in a deep optical lattice and should be observable in current experiments. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)"

We show that the degeneracy properties of $E$ and $E_1$ are closely related to the connectivity properties of the lattice. We determine general conditions under which $E$ is nondegenerate. This analysis is then extended to investigate the degeneracy of $E_1$. In this case, in addition to the lattice structure, the degeneracy also depends on the number of particles present in the system. After identifying the cases in which $E_1$ is degenerate and observing that the standard (degenerate) perturbation theory is not applicable, we develop a method to determine the zeroth-order correction to the ground state by exploiting the symmetry properties of the lattice. This method is used to implement the perturbative approach to the two-component Bose-Hubbard model in the case of degenerate $E_1$ and is expected to be a valid tool to perturbatively study the asymmetric character of the Mott-insulator to superfluid transition between the particle and hole side. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

The dynamics we consider is initiated from uncorrelated states that are easily prepared in experiments, and can be equivalently viewed as either Ramsey spectroscopy or a quantum quench. Our primary focus is the dynamical emergence of correlations and entanglement in these far-from-equilibrium interacting quantum systems: we characterize these correlations by the entanglement entropy, concurrence, and squeezing, which are inequivalent measures of entanglement corresponding to different quantum resources. In one spatial dimension, we show that the time evolution of correlation functions manifests a non-perturbative dynamic singularity. This singularity is characterized by a universal power-law exponent that is insensitive to small perturbations. Explicit realizations of these models in current experiments using polar molecules, trapped ions, Rydberg atoms, magnetic atoms, and alkaline-earth and alkali atoms in optical lattices, along with the relative merits and limitations of these different systems, are discussed. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

Transport properties through such weak links can be described with a single function, the current-phase relationship, which serves as the quantum analog of the current-voltage relationship. Here, we present a technique for inteferometrically measuring the current-phase relationship of superfluid weak links. We interferometrically measure the phase gradient around a ring-shaped superfluid Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) containing a rotating weak link, allowing us to identify the current flowing around the ring. While our BEC weak link operates in the hydrodynamic regime, this technique can be extended to all types of weak links (including tunnel junctions) in any phase-coherent quantum gas. Moreover, it can also measure the current-phase relationships of excitations. Such measurements may open new avenues of research in quantum transport. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

We thus show that the presence of dipolar interactions in this system leads to a rich phase diagram, and the formation of HQV molecules. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1198;Vortices and vortex states in Rashba spin-orbit-coupled condensates; Predrag Nikolić;  The Rashba spin-orbit coupling is equivalent to the finite Yang-Mills flux of a static SU(2) gauge field. It gives rise to the protected edge states in two-dimensional topological band-insulators, much like magnetic field yields the integer quantum Hall effect. An outstanding question is which collective topological behaviors of interacting particles are made possible by the Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Here we addresses one aspect of this question by exploring the Rashba SU(2) analogues of vortices in superconductors. Using the Landau-Ginzburg approach and conservation laws, we classify the prominent two-dimensional condensates of two- and three-component spin-orbit-coupled bosons, and characterize their vortex excitations. There are two prominent types of condensates that take advantage of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Their vortices exist in multiple flavors whose number is determined by the spin representation, and interact among themselves through logarithmic or linear potentials as a function of distance. The vortices that interact linearly exhibit confinement and asymptotic freedom similar to quarks in quantum chromodynamics. One of the two condensate types supports small metastable neutral quadruplets of vortices, and their tiles as metastable vortex lattices. Quantum melting of such vortex lattices could give rise to non-Abelian fractional topological insulators, SU(2) analogues of fractional quantum Hall states. The physical systems in which these states could exist are trapped two- and three-component bosonic ultra-cold atoms subjected to artificial gauge fields, as well as solid-state quantum wells made either from Kondo insulators such as SmB$_6$ or conventional topological insulators interfaced with conventional superconductors. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

It is found that the mean-field prediction of the atom-dimer scattering length ($a_{ad}$), as simply given by the boson-fermion scattering length ($a_{bf}$), generically fails. Instead, $a_{ad}$ crucially depends on the ratio between $a_{bf}$ and $a_{ff}$ (the fermion-fermion scattering length), and in addition log-periodically depends on the three-body parameter. We identify the universal parameters in characterizing $a_{ad}$ for a wide range of $a_{ff}$ in the molecular side of the fermion-fermion Feshbach resonance, and further demonstrate that the atom-dimer many-body system can become unstable against either phase separation or collapse as tuning $a_{ff}$.

Theoretical analysis indicates that this anomalous behavior can be explained by the anisotropic nature of the gain in the medium. There are two competing anisotropic processes: classical trajectory deflections due to the mean-field potential, and Bose enhanced scattering which bears similarity to super-radiance. We analyse the relative importance of these processes in the dynamical buildup of the anisotropic density distribution of scattered atoms, and compare to optically pumped super-radiance. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

The study is carried out using a variational approximation and a numerical solution. Plots of chemical potential and root mean square (rms) size of solitons are obtained for the quasi-one-dimensional model of three different dipolar condensates of 52Cr, 168Er and 164Dy atoms. The results achieved are in good agreement with those produced by the full three-dimensional mean-field model of the condensate. We also study the dynamics of the collision of a train of two solitons in the quasi-one-dimensional model of every condensate above. At small velocities (zero or close to zero) the dynamics is attractive for a phase difference {\delta} = 0, the solitons coalesce and these oscillate forming a bound soliton molecule. For a phase difference {\delta} = {\pi} the effect is repulsive. At large velocities the collision is independent of the initial phase difference {\delta}. This is quasi-elastic and the result is two quasi-solitons. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

For systems comprised of atoms of equal mass, with thermal reservoirs that are close to equilibrium, the dissipation rates of the theory are reduced to analytical expressions that may be readily evaluated. The unified treatment of binary contact interactions presented here provides a theory with broad relevance for quasi-equilibrium and far-from-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensates. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

Recently, the synthetic non-Abelian gauge fields have been created in the neutral degenerate Fermi gases, and moreover, generate many exotic effects. All the previous predictions can be well understood by the microscopic Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory. In this work, we establish an SU(2) Ginzburg-Landau theory for degenerate Fermi gases with the synthetic non-Abelian gauge fields. We firstly address a fundamental problem how the non-Abelian gauge fields, imposing originally on the Fermi atoms, affect the pairing field with no extra electric charge by a local gauge-field theory,and then obtain the first and second SU(2) Ginzburg-Landau equations. Based on these obtained SU(2) Ginzburg-Landau equations, we find that the superfluid critical temperature of the intra- (inter-) band pairing increases (decreases) linearly, when increasing the strength of the synthetic non-Abelian gauge fields. More importantly, we predict a novel SU(2) non-Abelian Josephson effect, which can be used to design a new atomic superconducting quantum interference device. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

Not only does the ground state transform from a condensate-like state to an effective Fermi sea, but new fundamental excitations, which do not have any higher-dimensional equivalents, are predicted to appear. In this work, we trace these elusive excitations via their effects on the dynamical structure factor of 1D strongly-interacting Bose gases at low temperature. An array of 1D Bose gases is obtained by loading a $^{87}$Rb condensate in a 2D lattice potential. The dynamical structure factor of the system is probed by energy deposition through low-momentum Bragg excitations. The experimental signals are compared to recent theoretical predictions for the dynamical structure factor of the Lieb-Liniger model at $T > 0$. Our results demonstrate that the main contribution to the spectral widths stems from the dynamics of the interaction-induced excitations in the gas, which cannot be described by the Luttinger liquid theory. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

Karg,  Tilman Esslinger,  Tobias Donner;  We present an optical setup with focus-tunable lenses to dynamically control the waist and focus position of a laser beam, in which we transport a trapped ultracold cloud of 87-Rb over a distance of 28 cm. The scheme allows us to shift the focus position at constant waist, providing uniform trapping conditions over the full transport length. The fraction of atoms that are transported over the entire distance comes near to unity, while the heating of the cloud is in the range of a few microkelvin. We characterize the position stability of the focus and show that residual drift rates in focus position can be compensated for by counteracting with the tunable lenses. Beyond being a compact and robust scheme to transport ultracold atoms, the reported control of laser beams makes dynamic tailoring of trapping potentials possible. As an example, we steer the size of the atomic cloud by changing the waist size of the dipole beam. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph); Optics (physics.optics); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2530;Topological growing of Laughlin states in synthetic gauge fields; Fabian Grusdt,  Fabian Letscher,  Mohammad Hafezi,  Michael Fleischhauer;"  We suggest a scheme for the preparation of highly correlated Laughlin (LN) states in the presence of synthetic gauge fields, realizing an analogue of the fractional quantum Hall effect in photonic or atomic systems of interacting bosons. It is based on the idea of growing such states by adding weakly interacting composite fermions (CF) along with magnetic flux quanta one-by-one. The topologically protected Thouless pump (""Laughlin's argument"") is used to create two localized flux quanta and the resulting hole excitation is subsequently filled by a single boson, which, together with one of the flux quanta forms a CF. Using our protocol, filling 1/2 LN states can be grown with particle number N increasing linearly in time and strongly suppressed number fluctuations. To demonstrate the feasibility of our scheme, we consider two-dimensional (2D) lattices subject to effective magnetic fields and strong on-site interactions. We present numerical simulations of small lattice systems and discuss also the influence of losses.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2669;Observation of coherent quench dynamics in a metallic many-body state of  fermionic atoms; Sebastian Will,  Deepak Iyer,  Marcos Rigol;  Quantum simulation with ultracold atoms has become a powerful technique to gain insight into interacting many-body systems. In particular, the possibility to study nonequilibrium dynamics offers a unique pathway to understand correlations and excitations in strongly interacting quantum matter. So far, coherent nonequilibrium dynamics has exclusively been observed in ultracold many-body systems of bosonic atoms. Here we report on the observation of coherent quench dynamics of fermionic atoms. A metallic state of ultracold spin-polarised fermions is prepared along with a Bose-Einstein condensate in a shallow three-dimensional optical lattice. After a quench that suppresses tunnelling between lattice sites for both the fermions and the bosons, we observe long-lived coherent oscillations in the fermionic momentum distribution, with a period that is determined solely by the Fermi-Bose interaction energy. Our results show that coherent quench dynamics can serve as a sensitive probe for correlations in delocalised fermionic quantum states and for quantum metrology. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2701;Dynamic trapping near a quantum critical point; Michael Kolodrubetz,  Emanuel Katz,  Anatoli Polkovnikov;  The study of dynamics in closed quantum systems has recently been revitalized by the emergence of experimental systems that are well-isolated from their environment. In this paper, we consider the closed-system dynamics of an archetypal model: spins near a second order quantum critical point, which are traditionally described by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Imbuing the driving field with Newtonian dynamics, we find that the full closed system exhibits a robust new phenomenon -- dynamic critical trapping -- in which the system is self-trapped near the critical point due to efficient absorption of field kinetic energy by heating the quantum spins. We quantify limits in which this phenomenon can be observed and generalize these results by developing a Kibble-Zurek scaling theory that incorporates the dynamic field. Our findings can potentially be interesting in the context of early universe physics, where the role of the driving field is played by the inflaton or a modulus. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)"

Using a linear response formulation, we determine the response of the gas to a small, time-dependent displacement of the harmonic trap and derive a simple exact relation showing that the centre-of-mass position of the atomic cloud is directly related to the global optical conductivity of the system. We demonstrate the usefulness of this approach by calculating the optical conductivity of bosonic atoms in an optical lattice. In the Mott insulating phase, there is clear evidence of an optical Mott gap, providing a proof-of-principle demonstration that the global optical conductivity gives high-quality information about the exci- tations of strongly-correlated quantum gases. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

We observe an atom-dimer loss resonance that is related to Efimov's scenario of trimer states. The resonance is found at a value of the scattering length that is different from a previous observation at low magnetic fields. This indicates non-universal behavior of the Efimov spectrum for positive scattering lengths. We compare our observations with predictions from effective field theory and with a recent model based on the van der Waals interaction. We present additional measurements on pure atomic samples in order to check for the presence of a resonant loss feature related to an avalanche effect as suggested by observations in other atomic species. We could not confirm the presence of such a feature. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

Blakie;  We present a theory for the number fluctuations of a quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate measured with finite resolution cells. We show that when the dipoles are tilted to have a component parallel to the plane of the trap, the number fluctuations become anisotropic, i.e. depend on the in-plane orientation of the measurement cell. We develop analytic results for the quantum and thermal fluctuations applicable to the cell sizes accessible in experiments. We show that as cell size is increased the thermodynamic fluctuation result is approached much more slowly than in condensates with short range interactions, so experiments would not require high numerical aperture imaging to observe the predicted effect. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3591;Predicting Energies of Small Clusters from the Inhomogeneous Unitary  Fermi Gas; J. Carlson,  S. Gandolfi;  We investigate the inhomogeneous unitary Fermi gas and use the long-wavelength properties to predict the energies of small clusters of unitary fermions trapped in harmonic potentials. The large pairing gap and scale invariance place severe restrictions on the form of the density functional. We determine the relevant universal constants needed to constrain the functional from calculations of the bulk in oscillating external potentials. Comparing with exact Quantum Monte Carlo calculations, we find that the same functional correctly predicts the lack of shell closures for small clusters of fermions trapped in harmonic wells as well as their absolute energies. A rapid convergence to the bulk limit in three dimensions, where the surface to volume ratio is quite large, is demonstrated. The resulting functional can be tested experimentally, and is a key ingredient in predicting possible polarized superfluid phases and the properties of the unitary Fermi gas in optical lattices. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Atomic and Molecular Clusters (physics.atm-clus); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

Specifically, we consider two-component mixtures of anyons and use these to eludicate the mixing-demixing properties of both balanced and imbalanced systems. Importantly, we demonstrate that the degree of demixing depends sensitively on the external trap in which the particles are confined. We also show how one may in principle probe the statistical parameter of an anyonic system by injection a strongly interacting impurity and doing spectral or tunneling measurements. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3821;Dynamical topological phases in quenched spin-orbit coupled degenerate  Fermi gas; Ying Dong,  Lin Dong,  Ming Gong,  Han Pu;  The spin-orbit coupled degenerate Fermi gas provides a totally new platform to realize topological superfluids and related topological excitations. Previous studies have mainly focused on the properties of the ground state. Here we consider a two-dimensional Fermi gas with Rashba spin-orbit coupling subject to a perpendicular Zeeman field. For this system, we have found that its ground state topological structure is captured by the spin texture, which is readily measurable in experiments. We show that, when the Zeeman field is suddenly quenched, dynamical topological phases can be realized. More specifically, three post-quench dynamical phases can be identified according to the asymptotic behavior of the order parameter. In the undamped phase, a persistent oscillation of the order parameter may support a topological Floquet state with multiple edge states. In the Landau damped phase, the magnitude of the order parameter approaches a constant via a power-law decay, and this system can support a dynamical topological phase with a pair of edge states at the boundary. In the over-damped phase, the order parameter decays to zero exponentially although the condensate fraction remains finite. These predictions can be observed in the strong coupling regime of ultracold Fermi gas. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

We detect the amplitude and the chirality of these supercurrents by measuring spiral patterns resulting from the interference of the cloud with a central reference disk. These measurements demonstrate the stochastic nature of the supercurrents. We further measure their distribution for different quench times and compare it with the predictions based on the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.4156;Topological Polaritons; Torsten Karzig,  Charles-Edouard Bardyn,  Netanel Lindner,  Gil Refael;"  The interaction between light and matter can give rise to novel topological states. This principle was recently exemplified in Floquet topological insulators, where \emph{classical} light was used to induce a topological electronic band structure. Here, in contrast, we show that mixing \emph{single} photons with excitons can result in new topological polaritonic states --- or ""topolaritons"". Taken separately, the underlying photons and excitons are topologically trivial. Combined appropriately, however, they give rise to non-trivial polaritonic bands with chiral edge modes allowing for unidirectional polariton propagation. The main ingredient in our construction is an exciton-photon coupling with a phase that winds in momentum space. We demonstrate how this winding emerges from spin-orbit coupling in the electronic system and an applied Zeeman field. We discuss the requirements for obtaining a sizable topological gap in the polariton spectrum, and propose practical ways to realize topolaritons in semiconductor quantum wells and monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.4632;Peltier cooling of fermionic quantum gases; Charles Grenier,  Antoine Georges,  Corinna Kollath;  We propose a cooling scheme for fermionic quantum gases, based on the principles of the Peltier thermoelectric effect and energy filtering. The system to be cooled is connected to another harmonically trapped gas acting as a reservoir. The cooling is achieved by two simultaneous processes: (i) the system is evaporatively cooled and (ii) cold fermions from deep below the Fermi surface of the reservoir are injected below the Fermi level of the system, in order to fill the 'holes' in the energy distribution. This is achieved by a suitable energy dependence of the transmission coefficient connecting the system to the reservoir. The two processes can be viewed as simultaneous evaporative cooling of particles and holes. We show that both a significantly lower entropy per particle and faster cooling rate can be achieved than by using only evaporative cooling. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)"

Ultracold molecules offer capabilities that are otherwise difficult or impossible to achieve in other effective spin systems, such as long-ranged spin-spin interactions with controllable degrees of spatial and spin anisotropy and favorable energy scales. Realizing quantum magnetism with ultracold molecules provides access to rich many-body behaviors, including many exotic phases of matter and interesting excitations and dynamics. Far-from-equilibrium dynamics plays a key role in our exposition, just as it did in recent ultracold molecule experiments realizing effective quantum magnetism. In particular, we show that dynamical probes allow the observation of correlated many-body spin physics, even in polar molecule gases that are not quantum degenerate. After describing how quantum magnetism arises in ultracold molecules and discussing recent observations of quantum magnetism with polar molecules, we survey prospects for the future, ranging from immediate goals to long-term visions. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el); Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)"

This effective model is characterized by a peculiar form of the inter particle interactions, which is crucially modified by the external confinement. The ring model allows for an intuitive understanding of the phase diagram of trapped condensates with isotropic spin-orbit coupling, and in particular for the existence of skyrmion lattice phases. The model, which may be generally applied for spinor condensates of arbitrary spin and spin-dependent interactions, is illustrated for the particular cases of spin-1/2 and spin-1 condensates. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.5087;Floquet Quantum Spin Hall Insulator in Cold Atomic Systems; Zhongbo Yan,  Bo Li,  Xiaosen Yang,  Shaolong Wan;  For cold atomic systems, varying the optical lattice potential periodically provides a general and simple way to drive the system into phases with nontrivial topology. Besides its simplicity, this driving approach, compared to the usual driving approach by exerting an external electromagnetic field to the static system, has the merit that it does not break the original static system's time-reversal symmetry at any given time. Based on this approach, we find that a trivial insulator with time-reversal symmetry can be driven into a Floquet quantum spin Hall insulator. This novel state of matter can stably host one or two pair of gapless helical states on the same boundary, which suggests this state is not a simple analog of the quantum spin Hall insulator. The effect of a time-reversal-symmetry-breaking periodic perturbation, the stability of the novel states, and this new driving approach to a system without time-reversal symmetry are discussed. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.5522;Three-body bound states in a harmonic waveguide with cylindrical  symmetry; D. Blume;  Highly-elongated quasi-one-dimensional cold atom samples have been studied extensively over the past years experimentally and theoretically. This work determines the energy spectrum of two identical fermions and a third distinguishable particle as functions of the mass ratio $\kappa$ and the free-space $s$-wave scattering length $a_{3\text{D}}$ between the identical fermions and the distinguishable third particle in a cylindrically symmetric waveguide whose symmetry axis is chosen to be along the $z$-axis. We focus on the regime where the mass of the identical fermions is equal to or larger than that of the third distinguishable particle. Our theoretical framework accounts explicitly for the motion along the transverse confinement direction. In the regime where excitations in the transverse direction are absent (i.e., for states with projection quantum number $M_{\text{rel}}=0$), we determine the binding energies for states with odd parity in $z$. These full three-dimensional energies deviate significantly from those obtained within a strictly one-dimensional framework when the $s$-wave scattering length is of the order of or smaller than the oscillator length in the confinement direction. If transverse excitations are present, we predict the existence of a new class of universal three-body bound states with $|M_{\text{rel}}|=1$ and positive parity in $z$. These bound states arise on the positive $s$-wave scattering length side if the mass ratio $\kappa$ is sufficiently large. Implications of our results for ongoing cold atom experiments are discussed. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

We present a detailed derivation of a general non-equilibrium Green's function technique which describes the coupled time evolution of an interacting BEC and its single-particle excitations in a trap, based on an expansion in terms of the exact eigenstates of the trap potential. We analyze the dynamics of a Bose system in a small double-well potential with initially all particles in the condensate. When the trap frequency is larger than the Josephson frequency, $\Delta > \omega_J$, the dynamics changes at a characteristic time $\tau_c$ abruptly from slow Josephson oscillations of the BEC to fast Rabi oscillations driven by quasiparticle excitations in the trap. For times $t<\tau_c$ the Josephson oscillations are undamped, in agreement with experiments. We analyze the physical origin of the finite scale $\tau_c$ as well as its dependence on the trap parameter $\Delta$. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.5546;Temperature-dependence of small harmonically trapped atom systems with  Bose, Fermi and Boltzmann statistics; Yangqian Yan,  D. Blume;  While the zero-temperature properties of harmonically trapped cold few-atom systems have been discussed fairly extensively over the past decade, much less is known about the finite-temperature properties. Working in the canonical ensemble, we characterize small harmonically trapped atomic systems as a function of the temperature using analytical and numerical techniques. We present results for the energetics, structural properties, condensate fraction, superfluid fraction, and superfluid density. Our calculations for the two-body system underline that the condensate and superfluid fractions are distinctly different quantities. Our work demonstrates that the path integral Monte Carlo method yields reliable results for bosonic and fermionic systems over a wide temperature range, including the regime where the de Broglie wave length is large, i.e., where the statistics plays an important role. The regime where the Fermi sign problem leads to reasonably large signal to noise ratios is mapped out for selected parameter combinations. Our calculations for bosons focus on the unitary regime, where the physics is expected to be governed by the three-body parameter. If the three-body parameter is large compared to the inverse of the harmonic oscillator length, we find that the bosons form a droplet at low temperature and behave approximately like a non-interacting Bose and eventually Boltzmann gas at high temperature. The change of the behavior occurs over a fairly narrow temperature range. A simple model that reproduces the key aspects of the phase transition like feature, which can potentially be observed in cold atom Bose gas experiments, is presented. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

The phase diagram and critical fields are analytically determined by the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations in zero temperature limit. High accurate equations of state, scaling functions are also obtained analytically for the strong interacting gases. The dynamic exponent $z=2$ and correlation length exponent $\nu=1/2$ read off the universal scaling form. It turns out that the quantum criticality of the three-component gases involves a sudden change of density of states of one cluster state, two or three cluster states. In general, this method can be adapted to deal with the quantum criticality of multi-component Fermi gases with $SU(N)$ symmetry. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)"

By numerically solving the time-dependent quasi-two dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation, we analyse the consequence of dipole-dipole interaction on vortex nucleation, vortex structure, critical rotation frequency and number of vortices for a range of OL depths. Rapid creation of vortices has been observed due to supplementary symmetry breaking provided by the OL in addition to the dipolar interaction. Also the critical rotation frequency decreases with an increase in the depth of the OL. Further, at lower rotation frequencies the number of vortices increases on increasing the depth of OL while it decreases at higher rotation frequencies. This variation in the number of vortices has been confirmed by calculating the rms radius, which shrinks in deep optical lattice at higher rotation frequencies. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

To model the evolution towards equilibrium at each cooling step, we derive quantum kinetic equations that describe the dynamics of the gas for temperatures above and below the transition temperature. These equations, valid in the Born and Markov approximations, consider the essential role of the chemical potential as the main parameter that signals the transition. The kinetic equation that describes the growth of the condensate below the transition temperature is derived within the Bogoliubov approximation. To illustrate our results we propose an energetic cooling protocol and simulate the whole sequence of the formation of a condensate. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

Devreese;"  We consider two large polaron systems that are described by a Fr\""{o}hlich type of Hamiltonian, namely the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) polaron in the continuum and the acoustic polaron in a solid. We present ground-state energies of these two systems calculated with the Diagrammatic Monte Carlo (DiagMC) method and with a Feynman all-coupling approach. The DiagMC method evaluates up to very high order a diagrammatic series for the polaron Green's function. The Feynman all-coupling approach is a variational method that has been used for a wide range of polaronic problems. For the acoustic and BEC polaron both methods provide remarkably similar non-renormalized ground-state energies that are obtained after introducing a finite momentum cutoff. For the renormalized ground-state energies of the BEC polaron, there are relatively large discrepancies between the DiagMC and the Feynman predictions. These differences can be attributed to the renormalization procedure for the contact interaction. ";Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

We show that, for a superfluid fermionic mixture, the standard phase imprinting procedure applied to both components fails to create a state with symmetry properties identical to those of the dark soliton solution of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. To produce a dark soliton in the BCS regime, a single component of the Fermi mixture should be phase imprinted only. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

This anomaly originates from an $\hbar$-dependent sparsity of the underlying quantum network of transitions. Using a minimal bi-partite Bose-Hubbard model as an example, we find that the relaxation rate acquires an anomalous $\hbar$ dependence that reflects percolation-like dynamics in energy space. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

The system responds through coherence peaks forming at specific echo times, each echo representing a particular process of quantum interference. We suggest a concrete realization for cold gases, where quantum interferences are observed in the momentum distribution of matter waves in a laser speckle potential. This defines a challenging, but arguably realistic framework promising to yield unprecedented insight into the mechanisms of Anderson localization. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)"

Hudson Smith,  Eric Braaten;  In a system of ultracold atoms near a Feshbach resonance, pairs of atoms can be associated into universal dimers by an oscillating magnetic field with frequency near that determined by the dimer binding energy. We present a simple expression for the transition rate that takes into account many-body effects through a transition matrix element of the contact. In a thermal gas, the width of the peak in the transition rate as a function of the frequency is determined by the temperature. In a dilute Bose-Einstein condensate of atoms, the width is determined by the inelastic scattering rates of a dimer with zero-energy atoms. Near an atom-dimer resonance, there is a dramatic increase in the width from inelastic atom-dimer scattering and from atom-atom-dimer recombination. The recombination contribution provides a signature for universal tetramers that are Efimov states consisting of two atoms and a dimer. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

We further show that additional Hubbard onsite interactions can give rise to spin liquid-like phases: weak and strong topological Mott insulators. They represent the celebrated paradigm of a quantum state of matter which merely exists because of the interplay of the non-trivial topology of the band structure and strong interactions. While the theoretical understanding of this phase has remained elusive, our proposal shall help to shed some light on this exotic state of matter by paving the way for a controlled experimental investigation in optical lattices. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.7757;Directed motion of doublons and holes in periodically driven Mott  insulators; Maximilian Genske,  Achim Rosch;"  Periodically driven systems can lead to a directed motion of particles. We investigate this ratchet effect for a bosonic Mott insulator where both a staggered hopping and a staggered local potential vary periodically in time. If driving frequencies are smaller than the interaction strength and the density of excitations is small, one obtains effectively a one-particle quantum ratchet describing the motion of doubly occupied sites (doublons) and empty sites (holes). Such a simple quantum machine can be used to manipulate the excitations of the Mott insulator. For suitably chosen parameters, for example, holes and doublons move in opposite direction. To investigate whether the periodic driving can be used to move particles ""uphill"", i.e., against an external force, we study the influence of a linear potential $- g x$. For long times, transport is only possible when the driving frequency $\omega$ and the external force $g$ are commensurate, $n_0 g = m_0 \omega$, with $\frac{n_0}{2},m_0 \in \mathbb{Z}$.

The question remains open as to whether this gap is a pseudogap phenomenon or is due to a molecular state. In this paper, by using a t-matrix approach, we reproduce quite well the experimental data for a 2D Fermi gas, and set the boundary between the pseudogap and molecular regimes. We also show that pseudogap phenomena occurring in 2D and 3D can be related through a variable spanning the BCS-BEC crossover in a universal way.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.7874;Experimental realisation of the topological Haldane model; Gregor Jotzu,  Michael Messer,  Rémi Desbuquois,  Martin Lebrat,  Thomas Uehlinger,  Daniel Greif,  Tilman Esslinger;  The Haldane model on the honeycomb lattice is a paradigmatic example of a Hamiltonian featuring topologically distinct phases of matter. It describes a mechanism through which a quantum Hall effect can appear as an intrinsic property of a band-structure, rather than being caused by an external magnetic field. Although an implementation in a material was considered unlikely, it has provided the conceptual basis for theoretical and experimental research exploring topological insulators and superconductors. Here we report on the experimental realisation of the Haldane model and the characterisation of its topological band-structure, using ultracold fermionic atoms in a periodically modulated optical honeycomb lattice. The model is based on breaking time-reversal symmetry as well as inversion symmetry. The former is achieved through the introduction of complex next-nearest-neighbour tunnelling terms, which we induce through circular modulation of the lattice position. For the latter, we create an energy offset between neighbouring sites. Breaking either of these symmetries opens a gap in the band-structure, which is probed using momentum-resolved interband transitions. We explore the resulting Berry-curvatures of the lowest band by applying a constant force to the atoms and find orthogonal drifts analogous to a Hall current. The competition between both broken symmetries gives rise to a transition between topologically distinct regimes. By identifying the vanishing gap at a single Dirac point, we map out this transition line experimentally and compare it to calculations using Floquet theory without free parameters. We verify that our approach, which allows for dynamically tuning topological properties, is suitable even for interacting fermionic systems. Furthermore, we propose a direct extension to realise spin-dependent topological Hamiltonians. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

To do so, we derive a description similar to the stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii equation (SGPE) but keeping a fully quantum description of the low-energy fields using the positive-P representation. This allows us to treat both the quantum and thermal fluctuations together in an integrated way. A plain SGPE only allows for thermal fluctuations. The approach is applicable to such situations as finite temperature quantum quenches, but not equilibrium calculations due to the time limitations inherent in positive-P descriptions of interacting gases. One sees the appearance antibunching, the generation of counter-propagating atom pairs, and increased phase fluctuations. We show that the behavior can be estimated by adding the T=0 quantum fluctuation contribution to the thermal fluctuations described by the plain SGPE. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

On the Bose-Einstein-condensate (BEC) side of a Feshbach resonance between fermionic atoms, this interaction energy can be directly related to the scattering length between a bosonic atom and a dimer composed of fermions. We calculate the atom-dimer scattering length from a three-body analysis with both a zero-range model and a separable model including the van der Waals length scale, and we find significant deviation from the result given by a mean-field approach. We also find that the multiple scattering between atom and dimer can account for such a deviation. Our results provide a calibration to the mean-field interaction energy, which can be verified by measuring the shift of collective oscillation frequency. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0284;Feshbach-Stabilized Insulator of Bosons in Optical Lattices; Laurent de Forges de Parny,  Valy G. Rousseau,  Tommaso Roscilde;  Feshbach resonances - namely resonances between an unbound two-body state (atomic state) and a bound (molecular) state, differing in magnetic moment - are a unique tool to tune the interaction properties of ultracold atoms. Here we show that the spin-changing interactions, coherently coupling the atomic and molecular state, can act as a novel mechanism to stabilize an insulating phase - the Feshbach insulator - for bosons in an optical lattice close to a narrow Feshbach resonance. Making use of quantum Monte Carlo simulations and mean-field theory, we show that the Feshbach insulator appears around the resonance, preventing the system from collapsing when the effective atomic scattering length becomes negative. On the atomic side of the resonance, the transition from condensate to Feshbach insulator has a characteristic first-order nature, due to the simultaneous loss of coherence in the atomic and molecular components. These features appear clearly in the ground-state phase diagram of e.g. $^{87}$Rb around its 414 G resonance, and they are therefore directly amenable to experimental observation. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

We demonstrate for the first time the dynamical fragmentation of a BEC despite its ground state being condensed. The results are analyzed by a mean-field model and suggest that a large manifold of low-lying fragmented excited states can significantly impact the dynamics of trapped two-dimensional BECs. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

Recently, the analysis of the mean-field (MF) counterpart of this system has demonstrated self-trapping of robust unstaggered discrete solitons, under condition $\alpha >1$. Using the numerically implemented method of the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), we demonstrate that, in a certain range of interaction, the BHM also self-traps, in the ground state, into a soliton-like configuration, at $\alpha >1$, and remains weakly localized at $\alpha <1$. An essential quantum feature is a residual density in the background surrounding the soliton-like peak in the BHM ground state, while in the MF limit the finite-density background is absent. Very strong onsite repulsion eventually destroys soliton-like states, and, for integer densities, the system enters the Mott phase with a spatially uniform density ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

Our focus is the time evolution of short-range correlations via the dynamical contact. We compute the dynamics using a combination of two- and many-body models, and we propose an intuitive connection between them that unifies their short-time, short-range predictions. Our two-body models are exactly solvable and, when properly calibrated, lead to analytic formulae for the contact dynamics. Immediately after the quench, the contact exhibits strong oscillations at the frequency of the two-body bound state. These oscillations are large in amplitude, and their time average is typically much larger than the unregularized Bogoliubov prediction. The condensate fraction shows similar oscillations, whose amplitude we are able to estimate. These results demonstrate the importance of including the bound state in descriptions of diabatically-quenched BEC experiments. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph)"

We extend the variational approach for tight-binding models at high entropies to a regime far beyond linear response. We analyze both weakly interacting fermions and incoherent bosons on a lattice. We consider a case where the particles are driven by a constant force, leading to the well-known Bloch oscillations, and we consider interactions that are weak enough not to overdamp these oscillations. This regime is computationally demanding and relevant for ultracold atoms in optical lattices. We derive a simple theory in terms of coupled dynamic equations for the particle density, energy density, current and heat current, allowing for analytic solutions. As an application, we identify damping coefficients for Bloch oscillations in the Hubbard model at weak interactions and compute them for a one-dimensional toy model. We also approximately solve the long-time dynamics of a weakly interacting, strongly Bloch-oscillating cloud of fermionic particles in a tilted lattice, leading to a subdiffusive scaling exponent. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)"

Suraud;  Two aspects of the transport of the repulsive Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in a double-well trap are inspected: impact of the interatomic interaction and analogy to the Josephson effect. The analysis employs a numerical solution of 3D time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation for a total order parameter covering all the trap. The population transfer is driven by a time-dependent shift of a barrier separating the left and right wells. Sharp and soft profiles of the barrier velocity are tested. Evolution of the relevant characteristics, involving phase differences and currents, is inspected. It is shown that the repulsive interaction substantially supports the transfer making it possible i) in a wide velocity interval and ii) three orders of magnitude faster than in the ideal BEC. The transport can be approximately treated as the d.c. Josephson effect. A dual origin of the critical barrier velocity (break of adiabatic following and d.c.-a.c. transition) is discussed. Following the calculations, robustness of the transport (d.c.) crucially depends on the interaction and barrier velocity profile. Only soft profiles which minimize undesirable dipole oscillations are acceptable. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

Natu,  Victor Galitski;  We compute the finite-temperature phase diagram of a pseudospin-$1/2$ Bose gas with contact interactions, using two complementary methods: the random phase approximation (RPA) and self-consistent Hartree-Fock theory. We show that the inter-spin interactions, which break the (pseudo) spin-rotational symmetry of the Hamiltonian, generally lead to the appearance of a magnetically ordered phase at temperatures above the superfluid transition. In three dimensions, we predict a normal easy-axis/easy-plane ferromagnet for sufficiently strong repulsive/attractive inter-species interactions respectively. The normal easy-axis ferromagnet is the bosonic analog of Stoner ferromagnetism known in electronic systems. For the case of inter-spin attraction, we also discuss the possibility of a \textit{bosonic} analog of the Cooper paired phase. This state is shown to significantly lose in energy to the transverse ferromagnet in three dimensions, but is more energetically competitive in lower dimensions. Extending our calculations to a spin-orbit-coupled Bose gas with equal Rashba and Dresselhaus-type couplings (as recently realized in experiment), we investigate the possibility of stripe ordering in the normal phase. Within our approximations however, we do not find an instability towards stripe formation, suggesting that the stripe order melts below the condensation temperature, which is consistent with the experimental observations of Ji \textit{et al.} [Ji \textit{et al.}, Nature Physics \textbf{10}, 314 (2014)]. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

Different from previous studies, we consider systems with fixed total particle number, which is of direct experimental relevance. We show that the onset of BEC is accompanied by sharp features in all these signatures, which can be probed via typical time-of-flight imaging techniques. In particular, we find a two-platform structure in the peak width across the phase transition. We show that the onset of condensation is related to the emergence of the higher platform, which can be used as an effective experimental signature. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

Using a hydrodynamic approach we study a confined binary condensate subject to both SO and Zeeman-type couplings. We find that in the limit of small healing length and in the phase with unbroken symmetry, the boundary magnetization profile has an analytical solution in the form of a sine-Gordon soliton. The soliton is bound to the edge of the system by the nontrivial boundary condition resulting from the combined effect of the SO coupling and the drop in the particle density. The same boundary condition is important in the magnetized phase as well, where we characterize numerically the boundary spin structure. We further discuss how the nontrivial magnetization structure affects the density profile near the boundary, yet another prediction that can be tested in current experiments of spin-orbit coupled condensates. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

Sil;  In this paper we present a theoretical investigation of the effect of a superlattice potential on some properties of non-interacting bosons in one dimensional lattices with Aubry-And\'re disorder potential. In the first part, we investigate the single particle localization properties. We find a re-entrant localization-delocalization transition and the development of multiple mobility edges for a range of superlattice potential strengths. In the second part, we study the Bose-Einstein condensation with an additional harmonic trapping potential. We find that an increase in the superlattice potential leads to an increase in the depletion of the condensate in the low temperature limit. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2256;Realization of Fractional Chern Insulators in the Thin-Torus-Limit with  Ultracold Bosons; Fabian Grusdt,  Michael Höning;  Topological states of interacting many-body systems are at the focus of current research due to the exotic properties of their elementary excitations. In this paper we suggest a realistic experimental setup for the realization of a simple version of such a phase. We show how delta-interacting bosons hopping on the links of a one-dimensional (1D) ladder can be used to simulate the thin-torus-limit of the two-dimensional (2D) Hofstadter-Hubbard model at one-quarter magnetic flux per plaquette. Bosons can be confined to ladders by optical superlattices, and synthetic magnetic fields can be realized by far off-resonant Raman beams. We show that twisted boundary conditions can be implemented, enabling the realization of a fractionally quantized Thouless pump. Using numerical density-matrix-renormalization-group (DMRG) calculations we show that the groundstate of our model is an incompressible symmetry-protected topological charge density wave (CDW) phase at average filling $\rho = 1/8$ per lattice site, related to the 1/2 Laughlin-type state of the corresponding 2D model. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

Using the summation of form factors we have obtained Fredholm determinant representations for the time-, space-, and temperature-dependent Green's functions which are particularly suited to numerical investigations. In the static case we have also derived the large distance asymptotic behavior of the correlators and computed the momentum distribution function at zero and finite temperature. We present extensive numerical results highlighting the characteristic features of one-dimensional systems with fractional statistics. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2501;Universality in Efimov associated tetramers in 4He; E. Hiyama,  M. Kamimura;"  We calculated, using seven realistic 4He-4He potentials in the literature, the Efimov spectra of the 4He trimer and tetramer and analyzed the universality of the systems. The three-(four-)body Schroedinger equations were solved fully nonadiabatically with the high-precision calculation method employed in our previous work on the 4He trimer and tetramer [Phys. Rev. A 85, 022502 (2012); 85, 062505 (2012)]. We found the following universality in the four-boson system: i) The critical scattering lengths at which the tetramer ground and excited states couple to the four-body threshold are independent of the choice of the two-body realistic potentials in spite of the difference in the short-range details and do not contradict the corresponding values observed in the experiments in ultracold alkali atoms when scaled with the van der Waals length r_vdW, and ii) the four-body hyperradial potential has a repulsive barrier at the four-body hyperradius R_4 \approx 3 r_vdW, which prevents the four particles from getting close together to explore nonuniversal features of the interactions at short distances. This result is an extension of the universality in Efimov trimers that the appearance of the repulsive barrier at the three-body hyperradius R_3 \approx 2 r_vdW makes the critical scattering lengths independent of the short-range details of the interactions as reported in the literature and also in the present work for the 4He trimer with the realistic potentials.

Wilson,  Marcos Rigol,  David S. Weiss;  Ultracold atomic gases have revolutionized the study of non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum many-body systems. Many counterintuitive non-equilibrium effects have been observed, such as suppressed thermalization in a one-dimensional (1D) gas, the formation of repulsive self-bound dimers, and identical behaviors for attractive and repulsive interactions. Here, we observe the expansion of a bundle of ultracold 1D Bose gases in a flat-bottomed optical lattice potential. By combining in situ measurements with photoassociation, we follow the spatial dynamics of singly, doubly, and triply occupied lattice sites. The system sheds interaction energy by dissolving some doublons and triplons. Some singlons quantum distill out of the doublon center, while others remain confined. Our Gutzwiller mean-field model captures these experimental features in a physically clear way. These experiments might be used to study thermalization in systems with particle losses or the evolution of quantum entanglement, or if applied to fermions, to prepare very low entropy states. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

Here we demonstrate such control over the quantum walk - the quantum mechanical analogue of the classical random walk - in the strong interaction regime. Using interacting bosonic atoms in an optical lattice, we directly observe fundamental effects such as the emergence of correlations in two-particle quantum walks, as well as strongly correlated Bloch oscillations in tilted optical lattices.

Martone,  Yun Li,  Sandro Stringari;  The striped phase exhibited by a spin-$1/2$ Bose-Einstein condensate with spin-orbit coupling is characterized by the spontaneous breaking of two continuous symmetries: gauge and translational symmetry. This is a peculiar feature of supersolids and is the consequence of interaction effects. We propose an approach to produce striped configurations with high-contrast fringes, making their experimental detection in atomic gases a realistic perspective. Our approach, whose efficiency is directly confirmed by three-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii simulations, is based on the space separation of the two spin components into a two-dimensional bilayer configuration, causing the reduction of the effective interspecies interaction and the increase of the stability of the striped phase. We also explore the effect of a $\pi/2$ Bragg pulse, causing the increase of the fringe wavelength, and of a $\pi/2$ rf pulse, revealing the coherent nature of the order parameter in the spin channel. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

This correction reduces the discrepancy between target and experimental light distribution to the level of a few percent (RMS error). We prove the generality of this algorithm by applying it to a variety of target light distributions of relevance for cold atomic physics. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph); Optics (physics.optics)"

Gorshkov;  We show that $n$ thermal fermionic alkaline-earth atoms in a flat-bottom trap allow one to robustly implement a spin model displaying two symmetries: the $S_n$ symmetry that permutes atoms occupying different vibrational levels of the trap and the SU($N$) symmetry associated with $N$ nuclear spin states. The high symmetry makes the model exactly solvable, which, in turn, enables the analytic study of dynamical processes such as spin diffusion in this SU($N$) system. We also show how to use this system to generate entangled states that allow for Heisenberg-limited metrology. This highly symmetric spin model should be experimentally realizable even when the vibrational levels are occupied according to a high-temperature thermal or an arbitrary non-thermal distribution. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el); Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

Recent experiments in ultracold atoms have unexpectedly revealed that the three-body parameter itself is universal when measured in units of an effective range. By performing an exact functional renormalization-group analysis with various finite-range interaction potentials, we demonstrate that the onset of the renormalization-group flow into the limit cycle is universal, regardless of short-range details, which connects the missing link between the two universalities of the Efimov physics. A close connection between the topological property of the limit cycle and few-body physics is also delineated. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)"

By treating the mean-field like shift of the quasiparticle energies in a self-consistent manner, we avoid the known pathological behavior of the standard Nozieres-Schmitt-Rink approach in the polarized case, i.e., the polarization has the right sign and the spin polarizability is positive. The momentum distributions of the correlated system are computed and it is shown that, in the zero-temperature limit, they satisfy the Luttinger theorem.

Dubin;"  Exchange processes are responsible for the stability of elementary boson condensates with respect to their possible fragmentation. This remains true for composite bosons when single fermion exchanges are included but spin degrees of freedom are ignored. We here show that their inclusion can produce a ""spin-fragmentation"" of a condensate of dark excitons, i.e., an unpolarized condensate with equal amount of dark excitons with spins (+2) and (-2). Quite surprisingly, for spatially indirect excitons of semiconductor bilayers, we predict that the condensate polarization can switch from unpolarized to fully polarized, depending on the distance between the layers confining electrons and holes. Remarkably, the threshold distance associated to this switching lies in the regime where experiments are nowadays carried out. ";Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

It is confined by a deformed harmonic trap and subject to a Zeeman field, Rashba or Dresselhaus one-body spin-orbit couplings and two-body short range repulsion. We obtain self-consistent mean-field $N$-body solutions as functions of the interaction parameters. Single-particle Spectra and total energies are computed and compared to the results without interaction. We perform a statistical analysis for the distributions of nearest neighbor energy level spacings and show that quantum signatures of chaos are seen in certain parameters regimes. Furthermore, the effects of two-body repulsion on the nearest neighbor distributions are investigated. This repulsion can either promote or destroy the signatures of potential chaotic behavior depending on relative strengths of parameters. Our findings support the suggestion that cold atoms may be used to study quantum chaos both in the presence and absence of interactions. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

V. Fedorov,  A. S. Jensen,  N. T. Zinner;  Strongly interacting one-dimensional quantum systems often behave in a manner that is distinctly different from their higher-dimensional counterparts. When a particle attempts to move in a one-dimensional environment it will unavoidably have to interact and 'push' other particles in order to execute a pattern of motion, irrespective of whether the particles are fermions or bosons. A present frontier in both theory and experiment are mixed systems of different species and/or particles with multiple internal degrees of freedom. Here we consider trapped two-component bosons with short-range inter-species interactions much larger than their intra-species interactions and show that they have novel energetic and magnetic properties. In the strongly interacting regime, these systems have energies that are fractions of the basic harmonic oscillator trap quantum and have spatially separated ground states with manifestly ferromagnetic wave functions. Furthermore, we predict excited states that have perfect antiferromagnetic ordering. This holds for both balanced and imbalanced systems, and we show that it is a generic feature as one crosses from few- to many-body systems. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

We predict that accounting for hyperfine interactions mediated Zeeman term in the mean-field approximation produces, in the case of the $403 \, G$ Feshbach resonance in the $|F,m_F> = |1,1>$ hyperfine state of a $^{39}K$ condensate, with $F$ the total spin of the atom, an experimentally observed (and not yet explained) shift in the condensation temperature $\Delta T_{c}/T_{c}^{0}=b^{*}_0+b^{*}_1 (a/\lambda_{T}) + b^{*}_2 (a/\lambda_{T})^2$ with $b^{*}_0 \simeq 0.0002$, $b^{*}_1 \simeq -3.4$ and $b^{*}_2 \simeq 47$, where $a$ is the s-wave scattering length, and $\lambda_T$ is the thermal wavelength at $T_{c}^{0}$. Generic expressions for the coefficients $b^*_0$, $b^*_1$ and $b^*_2$ are also obtained, which can be used to predict the temperature shift for other Feshbach resonances of $^{39}K$ or other atomic condensates. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

Through both analytic and numerical methods we verify that thermodynamic instability emerges if the number of particles is sufficiently yet finitely large: specifically $N\geq 35131$. The instability implies that the isobar of the gas zigzags on the temperature-volume plane, featuring supercooling and superheating phenomena. The Bose-Einstein condensation then can persist from absolute zero to the superheating temperature. Without necessarily taking the large $N$ limit, under constant pressure condition, the condensation takes place discretely both in the momentum and in the position spaces. Our result is applicable to a harmonic trap. We assert that experimentally observed Bose-Einstein condensations of harmonically trapped atomic gases are a first-order phase transition which involves a discrete change of the density at the center of the trap. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)"

Using a conventional trap-weakening evaporation scheme, where the optical trapping power is lowered, we obtain an array of up to four independent BECs. To improve evaporation efficiency, we propose to target each crossed trap site with a narrow auxiliary laser beam, creating an escape channel for energetic atoms. We experimentally demonstrate runaway evaporation using this scheme, which is characterized by very modest weakening in atomic confinement such that high densities and elastic collision rates can be maintained. Based on discretely time-shared optical tweezers, our approach is particularly suited for addressing the problem of simultaneously cooling atoms in multiple traps clouds, providing the freedom to act locally and in a tailored fashion at individual trap sites. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4630;Contact potential instability in the path-integral description of  itinerant ferromagnetism; E. Vermeyen,  J. Tempere;  It has long been predicted that a two-component non-localized Fermi gas will exhibit spontaneous polarization for sufficiently strong repulsive interactions, a phenomenon which is called itinerant ferromagnetism. Recent experiments with ultracold atomic gases have reached the interaction strength for which theoretical models have predicted the occurrence of the normal-to-itinerant-ferromagnetic phase transition, but so far this transition has not been observed. The instability of the repulsive branch of the Feshbach resonance prevents the formation of the itinerant ferromagnetic state, but it is not clear whether this is the only instability impeding its experimental realization. In this article, we use the path-integral formalism with density fields in the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation to study the stability of a homogeneous two-component Fermi gas with contact interactions. Within the saddle-point approximation we show that none of the extrema of the action are minima, meaning all extrema are unstable to small density fluctuations. This implies a more general mechanical instability of the polarized (itinerant ferromagnetic) and normal states of the system in the path-integral formalism. We find that it is important to consider the stability of the system when studying itinerant ferromagnetism. Since (mechanical) stability may be influenced by the details of the interaction potential, we suggest the use of a more realistic potential than the contact potential in future theoretical descriptions. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

Jin;"  The nature of the normal state of an ultracold Fermi gas in the BCS-BEC crossover regime is an intriguing and controversial topic. While the many-body ground state remains a condensate of paired fermions, the normal state must evolve from a Fermi liquid to a Bose gas of molecules as a function of the interaction strength. How this occurs is still largely unknown. We explore this question with measurements of the distribution of single-particle energies and momenta in a nearly homogeneous gas above $T_c$. The data fit well to a function that includes a narrow, positively dispersing peak that corresponds to quasiparticles and an ""incoherent background"" that can accommodate broad, asymmetric line shapes. We find that the quasiparticle's spectral weight vanishes abruptly as the strength of interactions is modified, which signals the breakdown of a Fermi liquid description. Such a sharp feature is surprising in a crossover. ";Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

Further exploitation of the idea leads to the conversion of open chains with internal degrees of freedom into artificial tori and M\""obius strips of different kinds.

Our model is based on the use of two independently trapped atomic species: the first one, subject to a strong in-plane confinement, constitutes a two-dimensional matter wave which interacts only with atoms of the second species, deeply trapped around the nodes of a two-dimensional optical lattice. By introducing a general analytic approach we show that the system Green function can be exactly determined, allowing for the investigation of the matter-wave transport properties. We propose some illustrative applications to both Bravais (square, triangular) and non-Bravais (graphene, kagom\'e) lattices, studying both ideal periodic systems and experimental-size and disordered ones. Some remarkable spectral properties of these atomic artificial lattices are pointed out, such as the emergence of single and multiple gaps, flat bands, and Dirac cones. All these features can be manipulated via the interspecies interaction, which proves to be widely tunable due to the interplay between scattering length and confinements. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)"

Such a soliton can freely move in the y-z plane. A rich variety of such excitations is considered: one quanta of excitation for movement along (i) y axis or (ii) z axis or (ii) both. A proposal for creating these excited solitonic states in a laboratory by phase imprinting is also discussed. We also consider excited states of quasi-2D dipolar BEC soliton where the sign of the dipolar interaction is reversed by a rotating orienting field. In this sign-changed case the soliton moves freely in the x-y plane under the action of a harmonic trap in the $z$ direction. At medium velocity the head-on collision of two such solitons is found to be quasi elastic with practically no deformation.

For this purpose we compare strongly-correlated systems with either relativistic or non-relativistic dispersion relation: relativistic quarks and mesons at finite isospin density and spin-imbalanced ultracold Fermi gases. Using a Functional Renormalization Group approach, we resolve fluctuation effects onto the corresponding phase diagrams beyond the mean-field approximation. We find that fluctuations induce a second order phase transition at zero temperature, and thus a Sarma phase, in the relativistic setup for large isospin chemical potential. This motivates the investigation of the cold atoms setup with comparable mean-field phase structure, where the Sarma phase could then be realized in experiment. However, for the non-relativistic system we find the stability region of the Sarma phase to be smaller than the one predicted from mean-field theory. It is limited to the BEC side of the phase diagram, and the unitary Fermi gas does not support a Sarma phase at zero temperature. Finally, we propose an ultracold quantum gas with four fermion species that has a good chance to realize a zero-temperature Sarma phase. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)"

Khamehchi,  Yongping Zhang,  Chris Hamner,  Thomas Busch,  Peter Engels;  We measure the collective excitation spectrum of a spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensate using Bragg spectroscopy. The spin-orbit coupling is generated by Raman dressing of atomic hyperfine states. When the Raman detuning is reduced, mode softening at a finite momentum is revealed, which provides insight towards a supersolid-like phase transition. We find that for the parameters of our system, this softening stops at a finite excitation gap and is symmetric under a sign change of the Raman detuning. Finally, using a moving barrier that is swept through the BEC, we also show the effect of the collective excitation on the fluid dynamics. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

We study the SAW attenuation and its velocity renormalization due to coupling with excitons. Both the deformation potential and piezoelectric mechanisms of the SAW-exciton interaction are considered. We focus our attention on the frequency and excitonic density dependencies of the SAW absorption coefficient and velocity renormalization at temperatures both above and well below the critical temperature of Bose-Einstein condensation of excitonic gas. We demonstrate that the SAW attenuation and velocity renormalization are strongly different below and above the critical temperature. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

We show that the phase slips responsible for the self-trapping regime are created by vortex rings entering and annihilating inside the weak-link region or created at the center of the barrier and expanding outside the system. Large amplitude oscillations just before the onset of self-trapping are also strictly connected with the dynamics of vortex rings at the edges of the inter-well barrier. Our results extend and analyze the dynamics of the vortex-induced phase slippages suggested a few decades ago in relation to the ""ac"" Josephson effect of superconducting and superfluid helium systems.

Zillich;  We present ground state calculations for low-density Fermi gases described by two model interactions, an attractive square-well potential and a Lennard-Jones potential, of varying strength. We use the optimized Fermi-Hypernetted Chain integral equation method which has been proved to provide, in the density regimes of interest here, an accuracy better than one percent. We first examine the low-density expansion of the energy and compare with the exact answer by Huang and Yang (H. Huang and C. N. Yang, {\em Phys. Rev.\/} {\bf 105}, 767 (1957)). It is shown that a locally correlated wave function of the Jastrow-Feenberg type does not recover the quadratic term in the expansion of the energy in powers of $\a0\KF$, where $\a0$ is the vacuum $s$-wave scattering length and $\KF$ the Fermi wave number. The problem is cured by adding second-order perturbation corrections in a correlated basis. Going to higher densities and/or more strongly coupled systems, we encounter an instability of the normal state of the system which is characterized by a divergence of the {\em in-medium\/} scattering length. We interpret this divergence as a phonon-exchange driven dimerization of the system, similar to what one has at zero density when the vacuum scattering length $\a0$ diverges. We then study, in the stable regime, the superfluid gap and its dependence on the density and the interaction strength. We identify two different corrections to low-density expansions: One is medium corrections to the pairing interaction, and the other one finite-range corrections. We show that the most important finite-range corrections are a direct manifestation of the many-body nature of the system. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

The ability to produce synthetic spin-orbit coupling in Bose-Einstein condensates has recently opened a new research field. Here we theoretically describe interference of two noninteracting spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates in an external synthetic magnetic field. We demonstrate that the spin-orbit and the Zeeman couplings strongly influence the interference pattern determined by the angle between the spins of the condensates, as can be seen in time-of-flight experiments. We show that a quantum backflow, being a subtle feature of the interference, is, nevertheless, robust against the spin-orbit coupling and applied synthetic magnetic field. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.6074;Scaling of Fluctuations in a Trapped Binary Condensate; R. N. Bisset,  R. M. Wilson,  C. Ticknor;  We demonstrate that measurements of number fluctuations within finite cells provide a direct means to study fluctuation scaling in a trapped two-component condensate. This quantum system supports a second-order phase transition between miscible (co-spatial) and immiscible (symmetry-broken) states that is driven by a diverging susceptibility to magnetic fluctuations. As the transition is approached from the miscible side the magnetic susceptibility is found to depend strongly on the geometry and orientation of the observation cell. However, a scaling exponent consistent with that for the homogenous gas ($\gamma = 1$) can be recovered, for all cells considered, as long as the fit excludes the region in the immediate vicinity of the critical point. As the transition is approached from the immiscible side, the magnetic fluctuations exhibit a non-trivial scaling exponent $\gamma \simeq 1.30$. Experimentally, the observation cells may be formed either by considering individual imaging pixels or by combining pixels to form larger cells, and fluctuation statistics can be obtained by repeated \emph{in situ} images. Interestingly, on both sides of the transition, we find it best to extract the exponents using an observation cell that covers half of the trapped system. This implies that relatively low-resolution \emph{in situ} imaging will be adequate for the investigation of these exponents. We also investigate the gap energy and find exponents $\nu z$ = 0.505 on the miscible side and, unexpectedly, $\nu z$ = 0.60(3) for the immiscible phase. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

A circular lattice couples two counter-rotating modes and squeezing is generated by the nonlinear interaction spatially modulated at half the lattice period. By varying the amplitude and phase of the modulation, various cases of the twisting tensor can be directly realized, leading to different squeezing regimes. These include one-axis twisting and the two-axis counter-twisting which are often discussed as the most important paradigms for spin squeezing. Our scheme naturally realizes the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model with the freedom to vary all its parameters simultaneously. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

We calculate the vortex precession velocity through a simple relationship between such a velocity and the gradient of the numerically obtained vortex energy. We observe that our results correspond very closely to the velocity calculated through time evolution simulations. However, we find that the estimates derived from available velocity field formulas present appreciable differences. To resolve such discrepancies, we further study the induced velocity field, analyzing the effect of global features of the condensate on such a field and on the precession velocity. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

For a SO-coupled BEC in a one-dimensional box, we show that in the absence of the Rabi term, any non-zero value of SO coupling will result in a phase separation among the components for a ferromagnetic BEC, like $^{87}$Rb. On the other hand, SO coupling favors miscibility in a polar BEC, like $^{23}$Na. In the presence of a harmonic trap, which favors miscibility, a ferromagnetic BEC phase separates, provided the SO-coupling strength and number of atoms are greater than some critical value. The Rabi term favors miscibility irrespective of the nature of the spin interaction: ferromagnetic or polar. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

We show theoretically that, under certain conditions, a pair of certain test particles immersed in a fractional quantum Hall state possesses, effectively, a fractional relative angular momentum, which can be interpreted in terms of fractional braid statistics. We propose that the fractionalization of the angular momentum can be detected directly through the measurement of the pair correlation function in rotating ultra-cold atomic systems in the fractional quantum Hall regime. Such a measurement will also provide direct evidence for the effective magnetic field, resulting from Berry phases arising from attached vortices, and of excitations with fractional particle number, analogous to fractional charge of electron fractional quantum Hall effect. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

In contrast with polarons in homogeneous condensates, the marginal impurity-boson interaction in the vortex lattice leads to infrared singularities in perturbation theory and to the breakdown of the quasiparticle picture in the low energy limit. These infrared singularities are interpreted in terms of a renormalization of the coupling constant, quasiparticle weight and effective impurity mass. The divergence of the effective mass in the low energy limit gives rise to an orthogonality catastrophe which is manifested as a power law singularity in the impurity spectral function. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.6319;Dynamical preparation of Floquet Chern insulators; Luca D'Alessio,  Marcos Rigol;  Realizing topological insulators is of great current interest because of their remarkable properties and possible future applications. There are recent proposals, based on Floquet analyses, that one can generate topologically nontrivial insulators by periodically driving topologically trivial ones. Here we address what happens if one follows the dynamics in such systems. Specifically, we present an exact study of the time evolution of a graphene-like system subjected to a circularly polarized electric field. We prove that, for infinite (translationally invariant) systems, the Chern number is conserved under unitary evolution. For systems with boundaries, on the other hand, we show that a properly defined topological invariant, the Bott index, can change. Hence, it should be possible to experimentally prepare topological states starting from non-topological ones. We show that the chirality of the edge current in such systems can be controlled by adjusting the filling. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall); Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.6341;Dissipative preparation of Chern insulators; Jan Carl Budich,  Peter Zoller,  Sebastian Diehl;  Engineered dissipation can be employed to prepare interesting quantum many body states in a non-equilibrium fashion. The basic idea is to obtain the state of interest as the unique steady state of a quantum master equation, irrespective of the initial state. Due to a fundamental competition of topology and locality, the dissipative preparation of gapped topological phases with a non-vanishing Chern number has so far remained elusive. Here, we study the open quantum system dynamics of fermions on a two-dimensional lattice in the framework of a Lindblad master equation. In particular, we discover a mechanism to dissipatively prepare a topological steady state with non-zero Chern number by means of short-range system bath interaction. Quite remarkably, this gives rise to a stable topological phase in a non-equilibrium phase diagram. We demonstrate how our theoretical construction can be implemented in a microscopic model that is experimentally feasible with cold atoms in optical lattices. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

We observe Hawking radiation emitted by the black hole. This is the output of the black hole laser. We also observe the exponential growth of a standing wave between the horizons. The latter results from interference between the negative energy partners of the Hawking radiation and the negative energy particles reflected from the inner horizon. We thus observe self-amplifying Hawking radiation. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)"

The ground states of these systems often exhibit a coexistence of compressible superfluid and incompressible Mott insulating regimes. We analyze such systems by studying the out-of-equilibrium dynamics following a weak sudden quench of the trapping potential. In particular, we show how the temporal variance of the site occupations reveals the location of spatial boundaries between compressible and incompressible regions. The feasibility of this approach is demonstrated for several models using numerical simulations. We first consider integrable systems, hard-core bosons (spinless fermions) confined by a harmonic potential, where space separated Mott and superfluid phases coexist. Then, we analyze a nonintegrable system, a $J-V-V'$ model with coexisting charge density wave and superfluid phases. We find that the temporal variance of the site occupations is a more effective measure than other standard indicators of phase boundaries such as a local compressibility. Based on these examples, we argue that analyzing temporal fluctuations is a valuable experimental tool for exploring phase boundaries in trapped atom systems. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

Instead of the standard approximation represented by the Bose-Hubbard model, we described those arrangements by continuous Hamiltonians that depended on the same parameters as the experimental setups. We found that for a given trap the optical potential depth, $V_0$, needed to create a single connected Mott domain decreased with the number of atoms loaded on the lattice. If the confinement was large enough, it reached a minimum when, in absence of any optical lattice, the atom density at the center of the trap was the equivalent of one particle per optical well. For larger densities, the creation of that single domain proceeded via an intermediate shell structure in which Mott domains alternated with superfluid ones. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

We show that the SF order parameters obey the two-component nonlinear Schroedinger equation (NLSE) with not only cubic but also quintic nonlinearity in the vicinity of the first-order transitions to the Mott insulators with even fillings. In the case of no BP, we analyze solitary-wave (SW) solutions of the cubic-quintic NLSE. When the SF state changes from a ground state to a metastable one, a standard dark SW turns into a bubble-like dark SW, which has a non-vanishing density dip and no pi phase kink even in the case of a standing SW. It is shown that the former and latter SW are dynamically unstable against an out-of-phase fluctuation and an in-phase fluctuation, respectively, and the dynamical instabilities are weakened when one approaches the transition point. We find that the size and the inertial mass of the SW diverge at the first-order transition point. We suggest that the divergence of the inertial mass may be detected through measurement of the relation between the velocity and the phase jump of the SW. In the presence of BP, we reveal that when the barrier strength exceeds a certain critical value, the SF state that was metastable without the barrier is destabilized towards complete disjunction of the SF. The presence of the critical BP strength indicates that the strong BP qualitatively changes the criticality near the metastability limit of the SF state. We derive critical behaviors of the density, the compressibility, and the critical current near the metastability limit induced by the BP. It is also found that the relation between the supercurrent and the phase jump across the BP exhibits a peculiar behavior, owing to the non-topological nature of the bubble-like SW. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

Rev. Lett. 111, 225301 (2013); Phys. Rev.

In analogy to the Wannier-Stark system, we call our system as the Wannier-Zeeman system. If there is no coupling between the two spin states, the system can be described by two crossing Wannier-Stark ladders with opposite tilts. The spatial crossing between two Wannier-Stark ladders becomes a spatial anti-crossing if the two spin states are coupled by external fields. For a wave-packet away from the spatial anti-crossing, due to the spin-dependent constant force, it will undergo spatial Landau-Zener transitions assisted by the intrinsic intra-band Bloch oscillations, which we call the Bloch-Landau-Zener dynamics. If the inter-spin coupling is sufficiently strong, the system undergoes adiabatic Bloch-Landau-Zener dynamics, in which the spin dynamics follows the local dressed states. Otherwise, for non-strong inter-spin couplings, the system undergoes non-adiabatic Bloch-Landau-Zener dynamics. ";"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

The recent Aarhus experiment[P. L. Pedersen et al., Phys. Rev. A. 88, 023620 (2013)] produced wave packets by applying the optical lattice's amplitude modulation to a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of $^{87}$Rb. The present paper renders a theoretical account with single-particle analysis of this experimental production of the wave packets and their subsequent time-evolution. We focus on the one-dimensional non-interacting bosonic system as a fundamental starting point for accurate quantum analysis and for further investigation of similar experiments. We show that a simple Rabi-oscillation model gives a good description of the wave packet production in terms of the inter-band transition while the first-order perturbation theory proves inadequate, that is the recent experiment already reached the realm of high-order couplings. As a natural extension, we demonstrate enhancement of the wave packet production by the two-step Rabi-oscillation method using either single frequency or dual frequencies. We assess the high-order Bragg reflection and Landau-Zener transition at a band gap with the aid of rigorous quantum time-propagation as well as the semi-classical theory exploited earlier by the Hamburg experiment [J. Heinze et al., PRL 107, 135303(2011)]. Complicated reflections and splittings of the wave packet during free evolution may be largely attributed to the intertwining of these two effects. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

We find a rich quantum phase diagram, where, in addition to the conventional phases ---superfluid and insulator--- contained in the spin-$1$ Bose-Hubbard model, there are new lattice symmetry breaking phases. For weak interactions, the interplay between two length scales, the lattice momentum and the spin-orbit wave-vector induce a phase transition from a uniform superfluid to a phase where bosons simultaneously condense at the center and edge of the Brillouin zone at a non-zero spin-orbit strength. This state is characterized by spin density wave order, which arises from the spin-$1$ nature of the system. Interactions suppress spin density wave order, and favor a superfluid \textit{only} at the Brillouin zone edge. This state has spatially oscillating mean field order parameters, but a homogeneous density. We show that the spin density wave superfluid phase survives in a two dimensional harmonic trap, and thus establish that our results are directly applicable to experiments on $^{87}$Rb, $^7$Li, and $^{41}$K. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

Nevertheless, it is shown that the robustness of bright solitons can be enhanced in this system, making their respective lifetime longer, by matching the time dependence of the interaction strength (adjusted with the help of the Feshbach-resonance management) to the time modulation of the strength of the parabolic potential. The analytical results, and their stability, are corroborated by numerical simulations. In particular, we demonstrate that the addition of random noise does not impact the stability of the solitons. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

Lewandowski;"  Well before the atomistic nature of matter was experimentally established, Ludwig Boltzmann's audacious effort to explain the macroscopic world of human experience in terms of the workings of an unseen microscopic world met with vigorous opposition. A contentious point was the problem of irreversibility: the microscopic equations of motion are reversible, yet friction and viscosity cause things always to slow down and warm up, never to speed up and cool down. What was worse, Boltzmann himself discovered that his transport equation predicts special cases in which gases never come to thermal equilibrium, a particular example being that the monopole ""breathe"" mode of gas will never damp if it is confined in 3D to a perfectly isotropic harmonic potential. Such absences of damping were not observed in nature. Nondamping of a monopole mode in lower dimensional systems has only very recently been observed, using cold atoms. Kinoshita et al. and Chevy et al. have experimentally observed suppressed relaxation in highly elongated geometries. The difficulty in generating sufficiently spherical harmonic confinement for ultracold atoms, however, has meant that Boltzmann's fully 3D, isotropic case has never been observed. With the development of a new magnetic trap capable of producing near-spherical harmonic confinement for ultracold atoms, we have been able to make the first observation of this historically significant oddity. We observe a monopole mode for which the collisional contribution to damping vanishes, a long-delayed vindication for Boltzmann's microscopic theory.

Using a gas of ultracold fermions in an optical lattice, we artifically prepare an initial charge density wave in an array of 1D tubes with quasi-random onsite disorder and monitor the subsequent dynamics over several thousand tunneling times. We find a strikingly different behavior between MBL and Anderson Localization. While the non-interacting Anderson case remains localized, in the interacting case any coupling between the tubes leads to a delocalization of the entire system. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Disordered Systems and Neural Networks (cond-mat.dis-nn); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

Parker;"  We study the family of static and moving dark solitons in quasi-one-dimensional dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates, exploring their modified form and interactions. The density dip of the soliton acts as a giant anti-dipole which adds a non-local contribution to the conventional local soliton-soliton interaction. We map out the stability diagram as a function of the strength and polarization direction of the atomic dipoles, identifying both roton and phonon instabilities. Away from these instabilities, the solitons collide elastically. Varying the polarization direction relative to the condensate axis enables tuning of this non-local interaction between repulsive and attractive; the latter case supports unusual dark soliton bound states. Remarkably, these bound states are themselves shown to behave like solitons, emerging unscathed from collisions with each other.

(2011) we proposed a method to utilize a temporally dependent superlattice potential to mediate spin-selective transport, and thereby probe long and short range magnetic correlations in optical lattices. Specifically this can be used for detecting antiferromagnetic ordering in repulsive fermionic optical lattice systems, but more generally it can serve as a means of directly probing correlations among the atoms by measuring the mean value of an observable, the number of double occupied sites. Here, we provide a detailed investigation of the physical processes which limit the effectiveness of this ""conveyer belt method"". Furthermore we propose a simple ways to improve the procedure, resulting in an essentially perfect (error-free) probing of the magnetic correlations. These results shows that suitably constructed superlattices constitute a promising way of manipulating atoms of different spin species as well as probing their interactions.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.00655;Vertically-coupled dipolar exciton molecules; Kobi Cohen,  Maxim Khodas,  Boris Laikhtman,  Paulo V. Santos,  Ronen Rapaport;  While the interaction potential between two dipoles residing in a single plane is repulsive, in a system of two vertically adjacent layers of dipoles it changes from repulsive interaction in the long range to attractive interaction in the short range. Here we show that for dipolar excitons in semiconductor heterostructures, such a potential may give rise to bound states if two such excitons are excited in two separate layers, leading to the formation of vertically coupled dipolar exciton molecules. Our calculations prove the existence of such bound states and predict their binding energy as a function of the layers separation as well as their thermal distributions. We show that these molecules should be observed in realistic systems such as semiconductor coupled quantum well structures and the more recent van-der-Waals bound heterostructures. Formation of such molecules can lead to new effects such as a collective dipolar drag between layers and new forms of multi-particle correlations, as well as to the study of dipolar molecular dynamics in a controlled system. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)"

Alon;  In the present work we show, analytically and numerically, that the variance of many-particle operators and their uncertainty product for an out-of-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) can deviate from the outcome of the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii dynamics, even in the limit of infinite number of particles and at constant interaction parameter when the system becomes 100% condensed. We demonstrate our finding on the dynamics of the center-of-mass position--momentum uncertainty product of a freely expanding as well as of a trapped BEC. This time-dependent many-body phenomenon is explained by the existence of time-dependent correlations which manifest themselves in the system's reduced two-body density matrix used to evaluate the uncertainty product. Our work demonstrates that one has to use a many-body propagation theory to describe an out-of-equilibrium BEC, even in the infinite particle limit. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

Carusotto;  We numerically study the temporal evolution of a black-hole laser configuration displaying a pair of black and white hole horizons in a flowing atomic condensate. This configuration is initially prepared starting from a homogeneous flow via a suitable space-dependent change of the interaction constant and the evolution is then followed up to long times. Depending on the values of the system parameters, the system typically either converges to the lowest energy solution by evaporating away the horizons or displays a continuous and periodic coherent emission of solitons. By making a physical comparison with optical laser devices, we identify the latter regime of continuous emission of solitons as the proper black-hole laser effect. We include some movies of the temporal evolution of the spatial density and velocity profiles in the most significant cases. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)"

Bolech;  In the theory of Bethe-ansatz integrable quantum systems, rapidities play an important role as they are used to specify many-body states, apart from phases. The physical interpretation of rapidities going back to Sutherland is that they are the asymptotic momenta after letting a quantum gas expand into a larger volume making it dilute and noninteracting. We exploit this picture to make a direct connection to quantities that are accessible in sudden-expansion experiments with ultracold quantum gases. By a direct comparison of Bethe-ansatz and time-dependent density matrix renormalization group results, we demonstrate that the expansion velocity of a one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model can be predicted from knowing the distribution of occupied rapidities defined by the initial state. Curiously, an approximate Bethe-ansatz solution works well also for the Bose-Hubbard model. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

The dependence of the strength of spin correlations on the specific geometry is experimentally studied by measuring the correlations along different lattice tunneling links, where a redistribution of correlations between the different lattice links is observed. By measuring the correlations in a crossover between distinct geometries, we demonstrate an effective reduction of the dimensionality for our atom numbers and temperatures. We also investigate the formation and redistribution time of spin correlations by dynamically changing the lattice geometry and studying the time-evolution of the system. Timescales ranging from a sudden quench of the lattice geometry to an adiabatic evolution are probed. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

We find that quasi-condensation mirrors Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless behavior in many ways, including the emergence of a strong zero momentum peak in the pair momentum distribution. Importantly, the disappearance of this quasi-condensate occurs at a reasonably well defined crossover temperature. The resulting phase diagram, pair momentum distribution, and algebraic power law decay are compatible with recent experiments throughout the continuum from BEC to BCS. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

At the non-interacting particle level, we find that the WKB (Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) approximation may not be used as a reliable tool to extract the trapping potential parameters from the experimentally measured tunneling data. We use our numerical calculations along with the experimental tunneling rates for the non-interacting system to reparameterize the trapping potential. The reparameterized trapping potentials serve as input for our simulations of two interacting particles. For two interacting (distinguishable) atoms on the upper branch, we reproduce the experimentally measured tunneling rates, which vary over several orders of magnitude, fairly well. For infinitely strong interaction strength, we compare the time dynamics with that of two identical fermions and discuss the implications of fermionization on the dynamics. For two attractively-interacting atoms on the molecular branch, we find that single-particle tunneling dominates for weakly-attractive interactions while pair tunneling dominates for strongly-attractive interactions. Our first set of calculations yields qualitative but not quantitative agreement with the experimentally measured tunneling rates. We obtain quantitative agreement with the experimentally measured tunneling rates if we allow for a weakened radial confinement. ";Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

There are cases, however, like ultra-cold trapped Fermi gases and the crust of neutron stars, where finite-size effects make it quite more complex to account for the geometrical arrangement of vortices. Here, we self-consistently generate these arrays of vortices at zero and finite temperature through a microscopic description of the non-homogeneous superfluid based on a differential equation for the local order parameter, obtained by coarse graining the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) equations. In this way, the strength of the inter-particle interaction is varied along the BCS-BEC crossover, from largely overlapping Cooper pairs in the BCS limit to dilute composite bosons in the BEC limit. Detailed comparison with two landmark experiments on ultra-cold Fermi gases, aimed at revealing the presence of the superfluid phase, brings out several features that makes them relevant for other systems in nature as well. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)"

It describes non-local correlations between quantum objects, and is at the heart of quantum information sciences. Entanglement is rapidly gaining prominence in diverse fields ranging from condensed matter to quantum gravity. Despite this generality, measuring entanglement remains challenging. This is especially true in systems of interacting delocalized particles, for which a direct experimental measurement of spatial entanglement has been elusive. Here, we measure entanglement in such a system of itinerant particles using quantum interference of many-body twins. Leveraging our single-site resolved control of ultra-cold bosonic atoms in optical lattices, we prepare and interfere two identical copies of a many-body state. This enables us to directly measure quantum purity, Renyi entanglement entropy, and mutual information. These experiments pave the way for using entanglement to characterize quantum phases and dynamics of strongly-correlated many-body systems. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

Surprisingly, in spite coupling with the chaotic motion of the spatial degrees of freedom, the spin relaxation can be suppressed by destructive quantum interference due to spherical vector and tensor terms of the spin-dependent interactions. Tuning the scattering lengths by the method of Feshbach resonances, readily available in cold atomic labs, can enhance the relaxation timescales by several orders of magnitude. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

This can give rise to the Kondo effect. However, in order to achieve this effect in current atomic gas experiment, it requires the Kondo temperature to be increased to a sizable portion of the Fermi temperature. In this letter we propose that the spin-exchange interaction can be strongly enhanced by utilizing the confinement-induced resonance (CIR). We analyze this system by the renormalization group approach, and we show that nearby a CIR, the Kondo temperature can indeed be increased to the regime attainable by current experiments. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

We find a critical velocity $v_{h}$ for traveling solitons that is much smaller than the value predicted using the Landau criterion due to the presence of spin-orbit coupling, which strongly upshifts the energy level of the soliton-induced Andreev bound states towards the quasi-particle scattering continuum. Above $v_{h}$, our time-dependent simulations in harmonic traps indicate that traveling solitons decay by radiating sound waves. In the topological phase, we predict the existence of peculiar Majorana solitons, which host two Majorana fermions and feature a phase jump of $\pi$ across the soliton, irrespective of the velocity of travel. These unusual properties of Majorana solitons may open an alternative way to manipulate Majorana fermions for fault-tolerant topological quantum computations. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

To this end we map the hopping dynamics of correlated anyons to an occupation-dependent hopping Bose-Hubbard model using the fractional Jordan-Wigner transformation. In particular, we calculate the quasi-momentum distribution of anyons, which interpolates between Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac statistics. Analytically, we apply a modified Gutzwiller mean-field approach, which goes beyond a classical one by including the influence of the fractional phase of anyons within the many-body wavefunction. Numerically, we use the density-matrix renormalization group by relying on the ansatz of matrix product states. As a result it turns out that the anyonic quasi-momentum distribution reveals both a peak-shift and an asymmetry which mainly originates from the nonlocal string property. In addition, we determine the corresponding quasi-momentum distribution of the Jordan-Wigner transformed bosons, where, in contrast to the hard-core case, we also observe an asymmetry for the soft-core case, which strongly depends on the particle number density. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)"

We show that the breaking of one of the hallmarks of superfluid flow, namely the quantisation condition on circulation, is continuous throughout an azimuthal phase separation process and displays intriguing density dynamics. We find that the resulting currents are stable for long times and possess a phase boundary that exhibits classical solid body rotation, despite the quantum nature of superfluid flow.

We demonstrate that the system exhibits thermalization in the context of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). We also explore the possibility of an initial state to delocalize with respect to the eigenstates of the postquench Hamiltonian even for energies away from the middle of the spectrum. We observe distinct regimes of equilibration process depending on the initial energy. For low energies, the system rapidly relaxes in a single step to a thermal state. As the energy increases towards the middle of the spectrum, the relaxation dynamics exhibits prethermalization and the lifetime of the metastable states grows. Time evolution of the occupation numbers and the von Neumann entropy in the mode-partitioned system underpins the analyses of the relaxation dynamics. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)"

The experimental system, a two-component Bose gas with coherent exchange between the constituents, allows for the necessary high level of control of parameters as well as the access to time-resolved spatial correlation functions. The theoretical analysis reveals that when quenching the system close to the critical point, the energy introduced by the quench leads to a short-time evolution exhibiting crossover reminiscent of the finite-temperature critical properties in the system's universality class. Observing the time evolution after a quench represents a paradigm shift in accessing and probing experimentally universal properties close to a quantum critical point and allows in a new way benchmarking of quantum many-body theory with experiments. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

The initial vortex state is prepared by creating a doubly charged vortex at the center of the condensate and letting it dissociate into two singly charged vortices. The separation of the vortex pair gradually increases over time and its increasing rate becomes higher with increasing the sample temperature $T$. The evolution of the vortex state is well described with a dissipative point vortex model including longitudinal friction on the vortex motion. For condensates of sodium atoms having a chemical potential of $\mu\approx k_B\times 120$ nK, we find that the dimensionless friction coefficient $\alpha$ increases from 0.01 to 0.03 over the temperature range of 200 nK $<T<$ 450 nK. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

We calculate the stiffness constants determining the stability of the nematic and stripe phases, and the melting of the stripes set by the proliferation of topological defects is analysed microscopically.

This novel, multi-pump injection method uses four coherent lasers arranged in a square, resonantly creating four polariton populations propagating inwards. The control available over the direction of propagation of the superflows allows injecting a controllable non-quantized amount of optical angular momentum. When the density at the center is low enough to neglect polariton-polariton interactions, optical singularities, associated to an interference pattern, are visible in the phase. In the superfluid regime resulting from the strong nonlinear polariton-polariton interaction, the interference pattern disappears and only vortices with the same sign are persisting in the system. Remarkably the number of vortices inside the superfluid region can be controlled by controlling the angular momentum injected by the pumps. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS); Optics (physics.optics); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02788;Freed by interaction kinetic states in the Harper model; Klaus M. Frahm,  Dima L. Shepelyansky;  We study the problem of two interacting particles in a one-dimensional quasiperiodic lattice of the Harper model. We show that a short or long range interaction between particles leads to emergence of delocalized pairs in the non-interacting localized phase. The properties of these Freed by Interaction Kinetic States (FIKS) are analyzed numerically including the advanced Arnoldi method. We find that the number of sites populated by FIKS pairs grows algebraically with the system size with the maximal exponent $b=1$, up to a largest lattice size $N=10946$ reached in our numerical simulations, thus corresponding to a complete delocalization of pairs. For delocalized FIKS pairs the spectral properties of such quasiperiodic operators represent a deep mathematical problem. We argue that FIKS pairs can be detected in the framework of recent cold atom experiments [M.~Schreiber {\it et al.} Science {\bf 349}, 842 (2015)] by a simple setup modification. We also discuss possible implications of FIKS pairs for electron transport in the regime of charge-density wave and high $T_c$ superconductivity. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

It was shown recently that an exotic topological superradiant state exists in a two-component degenerate Fermi gas coupled to a cavity, where local order parameters coexist with global topological invariants. In this work, we characterize in detail various properties of this exotic state, focusing on the feedback interactions between the atoms and the cavity field. In particular, we demonstrate that cavity-induced interband coupling plays a crucial role in inducing the topological phase transition between the conventional and topological superradiant states. We analyze the interesting signatures in the cavity field left by the closing and reopening of the atomic bulk gap across the topological phase boundary and discuss the robustness of the topological superradiant state by investigating the steady-state phase diagram under various conditions. Furthermore, we consider the interaction effect and discuss the interplay between the pairing order in atomic ensembles and the superradiance of the cavity mode. Our work provides many valuable insights into the unique cavity--atom hybrid system under study and is helpful for future experimental exploration of the topological superradiant state. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

Kevrekidis,  Theodore Kolokolnikov,  Ricardo Carretero-Gonzalez;  For a dissipative variant of the two-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation with a parabolic trap under rotation, we study a symmetry breaking process that leads to the formation of vortices. The first symmetry breaking leads to the formation of many small vortices distributed uniformly near the Thomas-Fermi radius. The instability occurs as a result of a linear instability of a vortex-free steady state as the rotation is increased above a critical threshold. We focus on the second subsequent symmetry breaking, which occurs in the weakly nonlinear regime. At slightly above threshold, we derive a one-dimensional amplitude equation that describes the slow evolution of the envelope of the initial instability. We show that the mechanism responsible for initiating vortex formation is a modulational instability of the amplitude equation. We also illustrate the role of dissipation in the symmetry breaking process. All analyses are confirmed by detailed numerical computations. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS)"

To suppress the heating by probe light with the $^1S_0$-$^1P_1$ transition of the wavelength $\lambda$ = 399 nm for high-resolution imaging and preserve atoms at the same lattice sites during the fluorescence imaging, we simultaneously cool atoms by additionally applying narrow-line optical molasses with the $^1S_0$-$^3P_1$ transition of the wavelength $\lambda$ = 556 nm. We achieve a low temperature of $T = 7.4(1.3)\ \mu\mathrm{K}$, corresponding to a mean oscillation quantum number along the horizontal axes of 0.22(4) during imaging process. We detect on average 200 fluorescence photons from a single atom within 400 ms exposure time, and estimate the detection fidelity of 87(2)%.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03638;Wavepacket dynamics on Chern band lattices in a trap; Sthitadhi Roy,  Adolfo G. Grushin,  Roderich Moessner,  Masudul Haque;  The experimental realization of lattices with Chern bands in ultracold-atom and photonic systems has motivated the study of time-dependent phenomena, such as spatial propagation, in lattices with nontrivial topology. We study the dynamics of gaussian wavepackets on the Haldane honeycomb Chern-band lattice model, in the presence of a harmonic trap. We focus on the transverse response to a force, which is due partly to the Berry curvature and partly to the transverse component of the energy band curvature. We evaluate the accuracy of a semiclassical description, which treats the wavepacket as a point particle in both real and momentum space, in reproducing the motion of a realistic wavepacket with finite extent. We find that, in order to accurately capture the wavepacket dynamics, the extent of the wavepacket in momentum space needs to be taken into account. The dynamics is sensitive to the interplay of band dispersion and Berry curvature over the finite region of momentum (reciprocal) space where the wavepacket has support. Moreover, if the wavepacket is prepared with a finite initial momentum, the semiclassical analysis reproduces its motion as long as it has a large overlap with the eigenstates of a single band. The semiclassical description generally improves with increasing real-space size of the wavepacket, as long as the external conditions (e.g., external force) remain uniform throughout the spatial extent of the wavepacket. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03826;Sculpting quasi one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate to generate  calibrated matter-waves; Javed Akram,  Axel Pelster;  We explore theoretically how to tune the dynamics of a quasi one-dimensional harmonically trapped Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) due to an additional red- and blue-detuned Hermite-Gaussian dimple trap (HGdT). To this end we study a BEC in a highly non-equilibrium state, which is not possible in a traditional harmonically confined trap. Our system is modeled by a time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation, which is numerically solved by the Crank-Nicolson method in both imaginary and real time. For equilibrium, we obtain a condensate with two bumps/dips which are induced by the chosen TEM$_{01}$ mode for the red/blue-detuned HGdT, respectively. Afterwards, in time-of-flight dynamics, we examine the adherence/decay of the two bumps/dips in the condensate, which are induced by the still present red/blue-detuned HGdT, respectively. On the other hand, once the red/blue HGdT potential is switched off, shock-waves or bi-trains of gray/dark pair-solitons are created. During this process it is found that the generation of gray/dark pair-solitons bi-trains are generic phenomena of collisions of moderately/fully fragmented BEC. Additionally, it turns out that the special shape of generated solitons in the harmonically trapped BEC firmly depends upon the geometry of the HGdT. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

Depending on the relative strength of the intra- and inter-component attraction, the stable solitons feature a semi-vortex or mixed-mode structure. In spite of the fact that the local cubic self-attraction gives rise to the supercritical collapse in 3D, the solitons are stable against random perturbations, motion, and collisions. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

Here we consider a repulsive two-component Fermi gas confined in a two dimensional isotropic harmonic potential and subject to a large Rashba spin-orbit (SO) coupling, whose single-particle dispersion can be tailored by adjusting the SO coupling strength. We show that the interplay among SO coupling, correlation effects and mean-field repulsion leads to a competition between ferromagnetic and non-magnetic phases. At intermediate interaction strengths, ferromagnetic phase emerges which can be well described by the mean-field Hartree-Fock theory; whereas at strong interaction strengths, a strongly correlated non-magnetic phase is favored due to the beyond-mean-field quantum correlation effects. Furthermore, the ferromagnetic phase of this system possesses a chiral current density induced by the Rashba spin-orbit coupling, whose experimental signature is investigated.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.04217;Beliaev damping in quasi-2D dipolar condensates; Ryan M. Wilson,  Stefan S. Natu;  We study the effects of quasiparticle interactions in a quasi-two dimensional (quasi-2D), zero-temperature Bose-Einstein condensate of dipolar atoms, which can exhibit a roton-maxon feature in its quasiparticle spectrum. Our focus is the Beliaev damping process, in which a quasiparticle collides with the condensate and resonantly decays into a pair of quasiparticles. Remarkably, the rate for this process exhibits a highly non-trivial dependence on the quasiparticle momentum and the dipolar interaction strength. For weak interactions, the low energy phonons experience no damping, and the higher energy quasiparticles undergo anomalously weak damping. In contrast, the Beliaev damping rates become anomalously large for stronger dipolar interactions, as rotons become energetically accessible as final states. Further, we find a qualitative anisotropy in the damping rates when the dipoles are tilted off the axis of symmetry. Our study reveals the unconventional nature of Beliaev damping in dipolar condensates, and has important implications for ongoing studies of equilibrium and non-equilibrium dynamics in these systems. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

However, despite their simplified character, their dynamics often cannot be simulated exactly on classical computers as soon as the number of particles exceeds a few tens. For this reason, the quantum simulation of spin Hamiltonians using the tools of atomic and molecular physics has become very active over the last years, using ultracold atoms or molecules in optical lattices, or trapped ions. All of these approaches have their own assets, but also limitations. Here, we report on a novel platform for the study of spin systems, using individual atoms trapped in two-dimensional arrays of optical microtraps with arbitrary geometries, where filling fractions range from 60 to 100% with exact knowledge of the initial configuration. When excited to Rydberg D-states, the atoms undergo strong interactions whose anisotropic character opens exciting prospects for simulating exotic matter. We illustrate the versatility of our system by studying the dynamics of an Ising-like spin-1/2 system in a transverse field with up to thirty spins, for a variety of geometries in one and two dimensions, and for a wide range of interaction strengths. For geometries where the anisotropy is expected to have small effects we find an excellent agreement with ab-initio simulations of the spin-1/2 system, while for strongly anisotropic situations the multilevel structure of the D-states has a measurable influence. Our findings establish arrays of single Rydberg atoms as a versatile platform for the study of quantum magnetism. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

Such a high symmetry is expected to give rise to a variety of novel phenomena ranging from molecular Luttinger liquids to (symmetry- protected) topological phases. We review some of the phases that can be stabilized in a one dimensional lattice. The physics of this multicomponent Fermi gas turns out to be much richer and more exotic than in the standard SU(2) case. For N > 2, the phase diagram is quite rich already in the case of the single-band model, including a molecular Luttinger liquid (with dominant superfluid instability in the N-particle channel) for incommensurate fillings, as well as various Mott-insulating phases occurring at commensurate fillings. Particular attention will be paid to the cases with additional orbital degree of freedom (which is accessible experimentally either by taking into account two atomic states or by putting atoms in the p-band levels). We introduce two microscopic models which are relevant for these cases and discuss their symmetries and strong coupling limits. More intriguing phase diagrams are then presented including, for instance, symmetry protected topological phases characterized by non-trivial edge states. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

Phonon modes generated in this condensate have their frequencies Doppler shifted by a persistent current. This frequency shift will cause a standing-wave phonon mode to be ""dragged"" along with the persistent current. By measuring this precession, one can extract the background flow velocity.

This Newtonian dynamical problem provides information for the soliton statics and dynamics, including scenarios of reflection, transmission, or quasi-trapping at such steps. The case of multiple such steps and its connection to barrier potentials is also touched upon.

Then we confirm the accuracy of these analytical solutions by comparing them to numerical results. From there, we numerically analyze how the BEC cloud expands non-ballistically, when the confining evanescent laser beam is shut off, showing agreement between our theoretical and previous experimental results. Furthermore, we analyze how the BEC cloud expands non-ballistically due to gravity after switching off the evanescent laser field in the presence of a hard-wall mirror.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06700;Topological Rice-Mele model in an emergent lattice: Exact  diagonalization approach; Krzysztof Biedroń,  Omjyoti Dutta,  Jakub Zakrzewski;  Using exact diagonalization methods we study possible phases in a one dimensional model of two differently populated fermionic species in a periodically driven optical lattice. The shaking amplitude and frequency are chosen to resonantly drive $s-p$ transition while minimizing the standard intraband tunnelings. We numerically verify that in the vicinity of vanishing intraband tunnelings the system, for an appropriate filling, shows an emergent density wave configuration of composites. The majority fermions moving in such a lattice mimic the celebrated Rice-Mele model. Far away from that region structure changes to clustered phase, with intermediate phase abundantly populated by defects of the density wave. These defects lead to loclaized modes carrying fractional particle charge. The results obtained are compared with earlier mean field approximation predictions. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06828;The Massive Goldstone (Higgs) mode in two-dimensional ultracold atomic  lattice systems; Longxiang Liu,  Kun Chen,  Youjin Deng,  Manuel Endres,  Lode Pollet,  Nikolay Prokof'ev;  We discuss how to reveal the massive Goldstone mode, often referred to as the Higgs amplitude mode, near the Superfluid-to-Insulator quantum critical point (QCP) in a system of two-dimensional ultracold bosonic atoms in optical lattices. The spectral function of the amplitude response is obtained by analytic continuation of the kinetic energy correlation function calculated by Monte Carlo methods. Our results enable a direct comparison with the recent experiment [M. Endres, T. Fukuhara, D. Pekker, M. Cheneau, P. Schau{\ss}, C. Gross, E. Demler, S. Kuhr, and I. Bloch, Nature 487, 454-458 (2012)], and demonstrate a good agreement for temperature shifts induced by lattice modulation. Based on our numerical analysis, we formulate the necessary conditions in terms of homogeneity, detuning from the QCP and temperature in order to reveal the massive Goldstone resonance peak in spectral functions experimentally. We also propose to apply a local modulation at the trap center to overcome the inhomogeneous broadening caused by the parabolic trap confinement. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)"

Hardman,  Ciaron Quinlivan,  Manju Perumbil,  Paul Wigley,  John E. Debs,  John D. Close,  Carlos C.N. Kuhn,  Nicholas P. Robins;  In weakly nonlinear dispersive systems, solitons are spatially localized solutions which propagate without changing shape through a delicate balance between dispersion and self-focusing nonlinear effects. These states have been extensively studied in Bose-Einstein condensates, where interatomic interactions give rise to such nonlinearities. Previous experimental work with matter wave solitons has been limited to static intensity profiles. The creation of matter wave breathers--dispersionless soliton-like states with collective oscillation frequencies driven by attractive mean-field interactions--have been of theoretical interest due to the exotic behaviour of interacting matter wave systems. Here, using an attractively interacting Bose-Einstein condensate, we present the first observation of matter wave breathers. A comparison between experimental data and a cubic-quintic Gross-Pitaevskii equation suggests that previously unobserved three-body interactions may play an important role in this system. The observation of long lived stable breathers in an attractively interacting matter wave system indicates that there is a wide range of previously unobserved, but theoretically predicted, effects that are now experimentally accessible. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.07232;Specific heat and effects of pairing fluctuations in the BCS-BEC  crossover regime of an ultracold Fermi gas; Pieter van Wyk,  Hiroyuki Tajima,  Ryo Hanai,  Yoji Ohashi;  We investigate the specific heat at constant volume $C_V$ in the BCS (Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer)-BEC (Bose-Einstein condensation) crossover regime of an ultracold Fermi gas above the superfluid phase transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$. Within the framework of the strong-coupling theory developed by Nozi\`eres and Schmitt-Rink, we show that this thermodynamic quantity is sensitive to the stability of preformed Cooper pairs. That is, while $C_V(T\gesim T_{\rm c})$ in the unitary regime is remarkably enhanced by {\it metastable} preformed Cooper pairs or pairing fluctuations, it is well described by that of an ideal Bose gas of long-lived {\it stable} molecules in the strong-coupling BEC regime. Using these results, we identify the region where the system may be viewed as an almost ideal Bose gas of stable pairs, as well as the pseudogap regime where the system is dominated by metastable preformed Cooper pairs, in the phase diagram of an ultracold Fermi gas with respect to the strength of a pairing interaction and the temperature. We also show that the calculated specific heat agrees with the recent experiment on a $^6$Li unitary Fermi gas. Since the formation of preformed Cooper pairs is a crucial key in the BCS-BEC crossover phenomenon, our results would be helpful in considering how fluctuating preformed Cooper pairs appear in a Fermi gas, to eventually become stable, as one passes through the BCS-BEC crossover region. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)"

Shenoy;  We investigate the new physics that arises when a correlated quantum impurity hybridizes with Fermi gas with a generalized Rashba spin-orbit coupling produced via a uniform synthetic non-Abelian gauge field. We show that the impurity develops a {\it fractional} local moment which couples anti-ferromagnetically to the Rashba-Fermi gas. This results in a concomitant {\it Kondo effect with a high temperature scale} that can be tuned by the strength of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)"

Szirmai;  We investigate magnetic properties of strongly interacting four component spin-3/2 ultracold fermionic atoms in the Mott insulator limit with one particle per site in an optical lattice with honeycomb symmetry. In this limit, atomic tunneling is virtual, and only the atomic spins can exchange. We find a competition between symmetry breaking and liquid like disordered phases. Particularly interesting are valence bond states with bond centered magnetizations, situated between the ferromagnetic and conventional valence bond phases. In the framework of a mean-field theory, we calculate the phase diagram and identify an experimentally relevant parameter region where a homogeneous SU(4) symmetric Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki-like valence bond state is present. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.07439;Suppression of two-body collisional loss in an ultracold gas via the  Fano effect; Jianwen Jie,  Yawen Zhang,  Peng Zhang;  The Fano effect (U. Fano, Phys. Rev. \textbf{15},1866 (1961) shows that an inelastic scattering process can be suppressed when the output channel (OC) is coupled to an isolated bound state. In this paper we investigate the application of this effect for the suppression of two-body collisional losses of ultracold atoms. The Fano effect is originally derived via a first-order perturbation treatment for coupling between the incident channel (IC) and the OC. We generalize the Fano effect to systems with arbitrarily strong IC--OC couplings. We analytically prove that, in a system with one IC and one OC, when the inter-atomic interaction potentials are real functions of the inter-atomic distance, the exact s-wave inelastic scattering amplitude can always be suppressed to \emph{zero} by coupling between the IC or the OC (or both of them) and an extra isolated bound state. We further show that when the low-energy inelastic collision between two ultracold atoms is suppressed by this effect, the real part of the elastic scattering length between the atoms is still possible to be much larger than the range of inter-atomic interaction.In addition, when open scattering channels are coupled to two bound states, with the help of the Fano effect, independent control of the elastic and inelastic scattering amplitudes of two ultracold atoms can be achieved. Possible experimental realizations of our scheme are also discussed. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.07486;Phase diagrams of bosonic $AB_{n}$ chains; G. J. Cruz,  R. Franco,  J. Silva-Valencia;  The $AB_{N-1}$ chain is a system that consists of repeating a unit cell with $N$ sites, where between the $A$ and $B$ sites there is an energy difference of $\lambda$. We considered bosons in these special lattices and took into account the kinetic energy, the local two-body interaction, and the inhomogenous local energy in the Hamiltonian. We found the charge density wave (CDW) and superfluid and Mott insulator phases, and constructed the phase diagram for $N=2$ and $3$ at the thermodynamic limit. The system exhibited insulator phases for densities $\rho=\alpha/N$, with $\alpha$ being an integer. We obtained that superfluid regions separate the insulator phases for densities larger than one. For any $N$ value, we found that for integer densities $\rho$, the system shows $\rho +1$ insulator phases, a Mott insulator phase, and $\rho$ CDW phases. For non-integer densities larger than one, several CDW phases appear. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

Natu;  We calculate the mean-field phase diagram of a zero-temperature, binary Bose mixture on a square optical lattice, where one species possesses a non-negligible dipole moment. Remarkably, this system exhibits supersolidity for anomalously weak dipolar interaction strengths, which are readily accessible with current experimental capabilities. The supersolid phases are robust, in that they occupy large regions in the parameter space. Further, we identify a first-order quantum phase transition between supersolid and superfluid phases. Our results demonstrate the rich features of the dipolar Bose mixture, and suggest that this system is well-suited for exploring supersolidity in the experimental setting. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

We are able to control the Bragg reflections at the Brillouin zone edge up to the third order. As a result, we can switch the quantum dynamics from oscillations across both the F and D bands to oscillations only within the F-band. Our capability to observe these remarkable oscillations comes from the innovative non-adiabatic technique which allows us to load ultracold atoms efficiently to the G-band of an optical lattice. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.08219;Topological superfluids on a square optical lattice with non-Abelian  gauge fields: Effects of next-nearest-neighbor hopping in the BCS-BEC  evolution; M. Iskin;  We consider a two-component Fermi gas with attractive interactions on a square optical lattice, and study the interplay of Zeeman field, spin-orbit coupling and next-nearest-neighbor hopping on the ground-state phase diagrams in the entire BCS-BEC evolution. In particular, we first classify and distinguish all possible superfluid phases by the momentum-space topology of their zero-energy quasiparticle/quasihole excitations, and then numerically establish a plethora of quantum phase transitions in between. These transitions are further signalled and evidenced by the changes in the corresponding topological invariant of the system, \textit{i.e.}, its Chern number. Lastly, we find that the superfluid phase exhibits a reentrant structure, separated by a fingering normal phase, the origin of which is traced back to the changes in the single-particle density of states. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el); Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.08225;Comparison of strong-coupling theories for a two-dimensional Fermi gas; Brendan C. Mulkerin,  Kristian Fenech,  Paul Dyke,  Chris J. Vale,  Xia-Ji Liu,  Hui Hu;  Understanding the formation of Cooper pairs and the resulting thermodynamic properties of a low-dimensional Fermi gas is an important area of research, elucidating our understanding of high temperature superconductors. In lower dimensions quantum fluctuations are expected to play an increasingly important role and the reliability of strong-coupling theories becomes questionable. Here, we present a comparison of recent thermodynamic measurements and theoretical predictions from different many-body $T$-matrix theories for a two-dimensional strongly interacting Fermi gas in the normal state. We find that the fully self-consistent $T$-matrix theory provides the best description of the experimental data over a wide range of temperatures and interatomic interactions. Our comparison reveals the crucial role played by the interactions between Cooper pairs and suggests that the future development of a quantitative strong-coupling theory for two-dimensional Fermi superfluids must explicitly take into account the diagrams that are responsible for pair-pair interactions. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

We focus on the properties of the non-equilibrium steady state reached at late times after the quench. Using recently developed methods based on integrability, we obtain an exact description of the stationary state for a large number of bosons. A distinctive feature of this state is the presence of a hierarchy of multi-particle bound states. We determine the dependence of their densities on interaction strength and obtain an exact expression for the stationary value of the local pair correlation $g_2$. We discuss ramifications of our results for cold atom experiments. ;"Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.08283;Polaronic effects in one- and two-band quantum systems; Tao Yin,  Daniel Cocks,  Walter Hofstetter;"  In this work we study the formation and dynamics of polarons in a system with a few impurities in a lattice immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). This system has been experimentally realized using ultracold atoms and optical lattices. Here we consider a two-band model for the impurity atoms, along with a Bogoliubov approximation for the BEC, with phonons coupled to impurities via both intra- and inter-band transitions. We decouple this Fr\""ohlich-like term by an extended two-band Lang-Firsov polaron transformation using a variational method. The new effective Hamiltonian with two (polaron) bands differs from the original Hamiltonian by modified coherent transport, polaron energy shifts and induced long-range interaction. A Lindblad master equation approach is used to take into account residual incoherent coupling between polaron and bath. This polaronic treatment yields a renormalized inter-band relaxation rate compared to Fermi's Golden Rule. For a strongly coupled two-band Fr\""ohlich Hamiltonian, the polaron is tightly dressed in each band and can not tunnel between them, leading to an inter-band self-trapping effect.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.08332;Quantum Hydrodynamics in One Dimension beyond the Luttinger Liquid; Tom Price,  Austen Lamacraft;  Recent years have seen the development of a rich phenomenology beyond the Luttinger Liquid model of one dimensional quantum fluids, arising from interactions between the elementary phonon excitations. It has been known for some time, however, that the straightforward inclusion of these interactions presents technical difficulties that have necessitated approaches based on refermionization or effective impurity models. In this work we show that the nonlinear extensions of the Luttinger model are tractable in the phonon basis. We present a calculation of the singularities present in the zero temperature dynamical structure factor in the semiclassical limit where the phonon dispersion is strong. A unitary transformation decouples interactions between left-- and right--moving phonons, leaving a nonlinear chiral Hamiltonian. At low momenta, this Hamiltonian has a spectrum bounded above and below by thresholds identified with phonon and soliton excitations in the semiclassical limit. The chiral dynamical structure factor therefore has support only in this region, with power law singularities at the thresholds originating in the Anderson orthogonality catastrophe, which we calculate analytically. The dynamical structure factor for the original nonchiral Hamiltonian is a convolution of this chiral correlator with a power law arising from the left--right decoupling. ;Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)

In this article an efficient renormalization group approach is presented which provides a description of Fr\""ohlich polarons in all regimes ranging from weak- to strong coupling. We apply the method to the Bose polaron problem of an ultracold impurity atom interacting with a background gas that is Bose-condensed. The extended renormalization group approach introduced here is capable to predict ground state properties for arbitrarily small impurity masses. This allows us to obtain the full phase diagram of the corresponding Bogoliubov-Fr\""ohlich Hamiltonian, characterized by two dimensionless coupling constants. Our method is benchmarked by comparison of the ground state energy to recent diagrammatic quantum Monte Carlo calculations. ";Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)
