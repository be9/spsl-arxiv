https://arxiv.org/abs/1109.0001;Vertex unfoldings of tight polyhedra; Toshiki Endo,  Yuki Suzuki;  An unfolding of a polyhedron along its edges is called a vertex unfolding if adjacent faces are allowed to be connected at not only an edge but also a vertex. Demaine et al showed that every triangulated polyhedron has a vertex unfolding. We extend this result to a tight polyhedron, where a polyhedron is tight if all non-triangular faces are mutually non-adjacent parallelograms. ;"Combinatorics (math.CO); Computational Geometry (cs.CG)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1109.0134;Plünnecke and Kneser type theorems for dimension estimates; Cédric Lecouvey (LMPT);"  Given a division ring K containing the field k in its center and A,B two finite subsets of K\{0}, we give some analogues of Pl\""unnecke and Kneser theorems for the dimension of the k-linear span of the Minkowski product AB in terms of the dimensions of the k-linear spans of A and B. These Pl\""unnecke type estimates are then generalized to the case of associative algebras. We also obtain an analogue in the context of division rings of a theorem by Tao classifying the sets of small doubling in a group. ";Combinatorics (math.CO)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1109.0191;Permutation Polytopes of Cyclic Groups; Barbara Baumeister,  Christian Haase,  Benjamin Nill,  Andreas Paffenholz;  We investigate the combinatorics and geometry of permutation polytopes associated to cyclic permutation groups, i.e., the convex hulls of cyclic groups of permutation matrices. We give formulas for their dimension and vertex degree. In the situation that the generator of the group consists of at most two orbits, we can give a complete combinatorial description of the associated permutation polytope. In the case of three orbits the facet structure is already quite complex. For a large class of examples we show that there exist exponentially many facets. ;"Combinatorics (math.CO); Group Theory (math.GR)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1109.0303;Obstacles, Slopes, and Tic-Tac-Toe: An excursion in discrete geometry  and combinatorial game theory; V S Padmini Mukkamala;  A drawing of a graph is said to be a {\em straight-line drawing} if the vertices of $G$ are represented by distinct points in the plane and every edge is represented by a straight-line segment connecting the corresponding pair of vertices and not passing through any other vertex of $G$. The minimum number of slopes in a straight-line drawing of $G$ is called the slope number of $G$. We show that every cubic graph can be drawn in the plane with straight-line edges using only the four basic slopes $\{0,\pi/4,\pi/2,-\pi/4\}$. We also prove that four slopes have this property if and only if we can draw $K_4$ with them. Given a graph $G$, an {\em obstacle representation} of $G$ is a set of points in the plane representing the vertices of $G$, together with a set of obstacles (connected polygons) such that two vertices of $G$ are joined by an edge if and only if the corresponding points can be connected by a segment which avoids all obstacles. The {\em obstacle number} of $G$ is the minimum number of obstacles in an obstacle representation of $G$. We show that there are graphs on $n$ vertices with obstacle number $\Omega({n}/{\log n})$. We show that there is an $m=2n+o(n)$, such that, in the Maker-Breaker game played on $\Z^d$ where Maker needs to put at least $m$ of his marks consecutively in one of $n$ given winning directions, Breaker can force a draw using a pairing strategy. This improves the result of Kruczek and Sundberg who showed that such a pairing strategy exits if $m\ge 3n$. A simple argument shows that $m$ has to be at least $2n+1$ if Breaker is only allowed to use a pairing strategy, thus the main term of our bound is optimal. ;"Combinatorics (math.CO); Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1109.0336;GL(p) x GL(q)-orbit closures on the flag variety and Schubert structure  constants for (p,q)-pairs; Benjamin J.

The key observation is that a certain subset of the $GL(p,\mathbb{C}) \times GL(q,\mathbb{C})$-orbit closures on the flag variety (those satisfying an easily stated pattern avoidance condition) are Richardson varieties. The result on structure constants follows when one combines this observation with a theorem of Brion concerning intersection numbers of spherical subgroup orbit closures and Schubert varieties.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1109.0366;Half-turn symmetric FPLs with rare couplings and tilings of hexagons; Jean-Christophe Aval (LaBRI),  Philippe Duchon (LaBRI, INRIA Bordeaux - Sud-Ouest);"  In this work, we put to light a formula that relies the number of fully packed loop configurations (FPLs) associated to a given coupling pi to the number of half-turn symmetric FPLs (HTFPLs) of even size whose coupling is a punctured version of the coupling pi. When the coupling pi is the coupling with all arches parallel pi0 (the ""rarest"" one), this formula states the equality of the number of corresponding HTFPLs to the number of cyclically-symmetric plane partition of the same size. We provide a bijective proof of this fact. In the case of HTFPLs odd size, and although there is no similar expression, we study the number of HTFPLs whose coupling is a slit version of pi_0, and put to light new puzzling enumerative coincidence involving countings of tilings of hexagons and various symmetry classes of FPLs.

We exhibit an elementary insertion procedure on our tableaux which gives a clear proof that tree-like tableaux of size n are counted by n!, and which moreover respects most of the well-known statistics studied originally on alternative and permutation tableaux. Our insertion procedure allows to define in particular two simple new bijections between tree-like tableaux and permutations: the first one is conceived specifically to respect the generalized pattern 2-31, while the second one respects the underlying tree of a tree-like tableau. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1109.0417;An Analogue of Hilton-Milner Theorem for Set Partitions; Cheng Yeaw Ku,  Kok Bin Wong;  Let $\mathcal{B}(n)$ denote the collection of all set partitions of $[n]$. Suppose $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathcal{B}(n)$ is a non-trivial $t$-intersecting family of set partitions i.e. any two members of $\A$ have at least $t$ blocks in common, but there is no fixed $t$ blocks of size one which belong to all of them. It is proved that for sufficiently large $n$ depending on $t$, \[ |\mathcal{A}| \le B_{n-t}-\tilde{B}_{n-t}-\tilde{B}_{n-t-1}+t \] where $B_{n}$ is the $n$-th Bell number and $\tilde{B}_{n}$ is the number of set partitions of $[n]$ without blocks of size one. Moreover, equality holds if and only if $\mathcal{A}$ is equivalent to \[ \{P \in \mathcal{B}(n): \{1\}, \{2\},..., \{t\}, \{i\} \in P \textnormal{for some} i \not = 1,2,..., t,n \}\cup \{Q(i,n)\ :\ 1\leq i\leq t\} \] where $Q(i,n)=\{\{i,n\}\}\cup\{\{j\}\ :\ j\in [n]\setminus \{i,n\}\}$.

Little is known about this question apart from a few simple observations. We show that the number of trees on $n$ vertices which can be distinguished by their associated integer sequences is $e^{\Omega((\log n)^{3/2})}$.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1109.0694;Multi-orientable Group Field Theory; Adrian Tanasa;"  Group Field Theories (GFT) are quantum field theories over group manifolds; they can be seen as a generalization of matrix models. GFT Feynman graphs are tensor graphs generalizing ribbon graphs (or combinatorial maps); these graphs are dual not only to manifolds. In order to simplify the topological structure of these various singularities, colored GFT was recently introduced and intensively studied since. We propose here a different simplification of GFT, which we call multi-orientable GFT. We study the relation between multi-orientable GFT Feynman graphs and colorable graphs. We prove that tadfaces and some generalized tadpoles are absent. Some Feynman amplitude computations are performed. A few remarks on the renormalizability of both multi-orientable and colorable GFT are made. A generalization from three-dimensional to four-dimensional theories is also proposed.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1109.0707;A brief, simple proof of Vizing's conjecture; Elliot Krop;  For any graph $G=(V,E)$, a subset $S\subseteq V$ \emph{dominates} $G$ if all vertices are contained in the closed neighborhood of $S$, that is $N[S]=V$. The minimum cardinality over all such $S$ is called the domination number, written $\gamma(G)$. In 1963, V.G.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1109.0787;Rooted-tree Decompositions with Matroid Constraints and the  Infinitesimal Rigidity of Frameworks with Boundaries; Naoki Katoh,  Shin-ichi Tanigawa;"  As an extension of a classical tree-partition problem, we consider decompositions of graphs into edge-disjoint (rooted-)trees with an additional matroid constraint. Specifically, suppose we are given a graph $G=(V,E)$, a multiset $R=\{r1,..., r_t\}$ of vertices in $V$, and a matroid ${\cal M}$ on $R$. We prove a necessary and sufficient condition for $G$ to be decomposed into $t$ edge-disjoint subgraphs $G_1=(V_1,T_1),..., G_t=(V_t,T_t)$ such that (i) for each $i$, $G_i$ is a tree with $r_i\in V_i$, and (ii) for each $v\in V$, the multiset $\{r_i\in R\mid v\in V_i\}$ is a base of ${\cal M}$. If ${\cal M}$ is a free matroid, this is a decomposition into $t$ edge-disjoint spanning trees; thus, our result is a proper extension of Nash-Williams' tree-partition theorem. Such a matroid constraint is motivated by combinatorial rigidity theory. As a direct application of our decomposition theorem, we present characterizations of the infinitesimal rigidity of frameworks with non-generic ""boundary"", which extend classical Laman's theorem for generic 2-rigidity of bar-joint frameworks and Tay's theorem for generic $d$-rigidity of body-bar frameworks.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1109.1082;A geometric and combinatorial view of weighted voting; Sarah Mason,  Jason Parsley;  A natural partial ordering exists on the set of all weighted games and, more broadly, on all linear games. We describe several properties of the partially ordered sets formed by these games and utilize this perspective to enumerate proper linear games with one generator. We introduce a geometric approach to weighted voting by considering the convex polytope of all possible realizations of a weighted game and connect this geometric perspective to the weighted games poset in several ways. In particular, we prove that generic vertical lines in $C_n$, the union of all weighted $n$-player polytopes, correspond to maximal saturated chains in the poset of weighted games, i.e., the poset is a blueprint for how the polytopes fit together to form $C_n$. We show how to compare the relationships between the powers of the players using the polytope directly. Finally, we describe the facets of each polytope, from which we develop a method for determining the weightedness of any linear game that covers or is covered by a weighted game. ;"Combinatorics (math.CO); Computer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT)"

We also provide a characterisation of families representable over a given alphabet. Then, we associate a rank function and a rank operator to any representation which help us determine some criteria for the functions used in a representation. While linearly representable matroids can be viewed as having representations via matrices with only one row, we conclude this paper by an investigation of representations via matrices with only two rows. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

The boundary of the Gelfand-Tsetlin graph has at least three incarnations --- as a discrete potential theory boundary, as the set of finite indecomposable characters of the infinite-dimensional unitary group, and as the set of doubly infinite totally positive sequences. An old deep result due to Albert Edrei and Dan Voiculescu provides an explicit description of the boundary; it can be realized as a region in an infinite-dimensional coordinate space. The paper contains a novel approach to the Edrei-Voiculescu theorem. It is based on a new explicit formula for the number of semi-standard Young tableaux of a given skew shape (or of Gelfand-Tsetlin schemes of trapezoidal shape). The formula is obtained via the theory of symmetric functions, and new Schur-like symmetric functions play a key role in the derivation.

This is based on ideas from resurgence theory, in particular on the construction of well-behaved averages induced by diffusion processes on the real line. We give several interpretations and proofs of the main result in terms of noncommutative symmetric and quasisymmetric functions, as well as generalizations involving matrix quasi-symmetric functions. The interpretation of noncommutative symmetric functions as alien operators in resurgence theory is also discussed, and a new family of Lie idempotents of descent algebras is derived from this interpretation. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1109.1657;Complexity of Bondage and Reinforcement; Fu-Tao Hu,  Jun-Ming Xu;  Let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph. A subset $D\subseteq V$ is a dominating set if every vertex not in $D$ is adjacent to a vertex in $D$. A dominating set $D$ is called a total dominating set if every vertex in $D$ is adjacent to a vertex in $D$. The domination (resp. total domination) number of $G$ is the smallest cardinality of a dominating (resp. total dominating) set of $G$. The bondage (resp. total bondage) number of a nonempty graph $G$ is the smallest number of edges whose removal from $G$ results in a graph with larger domination (resp. total domination) number of $G$. The reinforcement number of $G$ is the smallest number of edges whose addition to $G$ results in a graph with smaller domination number. This paper shows that the decision problems for bondage, total bondage and reinforcement are all NP-hard. ;"Combinatorics (math.CO); Computational Complexity (cs.CC)"

Using notions of composita and composition of generating functions, we get new properties for this composition. The properties can be used for distinguishing prime numbers from composite numbers. As an application, obtained results can be used to obtain new primality criteria. We obtain primality criteria for the Mersenne numbers, the Lucas numbers, the Pell-Lucas numbers, the Jacobsthal-Lucas numbers, and the Lucas sequences.

Let $\mathcal{C}\subseteq \{0,1,..., k-1}^n$ be a $k$-ary code of length $n$. For a subset of coordinates $S\subset{1,2,...,n}$ the projection of $\mathcal{C}$ to $S$ is denoted by $\mathcal{C}|_S$. We say that $\mathcal{C}$ $(i,j)$-{\em shatters} $S$ if $\mathcal{C}|_S$ contains all the $2^{|S|}$ distinct vectors (codewords) with coordinates $i$ and $j$. Suppose that $\mathcal{C}$ does not $(i,j)$-shatter any coordinate set of size $s_{i,j}\geq 1$ for every $1\leq i< j\leq q$ and let $p=\sum (s_{i,j}-1)$. Using a natural induction we prove that $$ |{\mathcal C}|\leq O(n^p)$$ for any given $p$ as $n\to \infty$ and give a construction showing that this exponent is the best possible.

If, in addition, one allow bishop steps, that is, proper diagonal steps of slope 1, then one has queen paths. A rook or queen path is Catalan if it starts at the origin and stays strictly to the left of the line y = x-1. We give explicit formulas for the ordinary generating function of the number of Catalan rook and queen paths finishing at $(n,n).$ These generating functions are algebraic; indeed, they satisfy quadratic equations. In the second version, we also consider paths with ""spider steps"", that is, proper steps on lattice points with slope strictly greater than one. In the third version, we give step-enumerator versions of our results. ";Combinatorics (math.CO)

Hicks;  A dominating set $D$ for a graph $G$ is a subset of $V(G)$ such that any vertex not in $D$ has at least one neighbor in $D$. The domination number $\gamma(G)$ is the size of a minimum dominating set in $G$. Vizing's conjecture from 1968 states that for the Cartesian product of graphs $G$ and $H$, $\gamma(G) \gamma(H) \leq \gamma(G \Box H)$, and Clark and Suen (2000) proved that $\gamma(G) \gamma(H) \leq 2\gamma(G \Box H)$. In this paper, we modify the approach of Clark and Suen to prove a variety of similar bounds related to total and paired domination, and also extend these bounds to the $n$-Cartesian product of graphs $A^1$ through $A^n$. ;"Combinatorics (math.CO); Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM)"

We show that for any bridge-addable, monotone class A whose elements have vertex set 1,...,n, the probability that a uniformly random element of A is connected is at least (1-o_n(1)) e^{-1/2}, where o_n(1) tends to zero as n tends to infinity.

We consider variations of this problem by replacing the Sperner property with the intersection property and considering families that satisfiy various combinations of these properties on one or both parts $X_1$, $X_2$. Along the way, we prove the following new result which may be of independent interest: let $\cF, \cG$ be families of subsets of an $n$-element set such that $\cF$ and $\cG$ are both intersecting and cross-Sperner, meaning that if $A \in \cF$ and $B \in \cG$, then $A \not\subset B$ and $B \not\subset A$. Then $|\cF| +|\cG| < 2^{n-1}$ and there are exponentially many examples showing that this bound is tight. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

On the cop turn, each cop may move to a neighboring vertex or remain in place. On the robber's turn, he moves similarly. The cops win if there is some time at which a cop is at the same vertex as the robber. Otherwise, the robber wins. The minimum number of cops required to catch the robber is called the \emph{cop number} of $G$, and is denoted $c(G)$. Let $m_k$ be the minimum order of a connected graph satisfying $c(G) \geq k$. Recently, Baird and Bonato determined via computer search that $m_3=10$ and that this value is attained uniquely by the Petersen graph. Herein, we give a self-contained mathematical proof of this result. Along the way, we give some characterizations of graphs with $c(G) >2$ and very high maximum degree. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

A set $D \subseteq V(G)$ is a vertex identifying code if for any two distinct vertices $v_1, v_2 \in V(G)$, the vertex sets $N[v_1] \cap D$ and $N[v_2] \cap D$ are distinct and non-empty.

We also prove two Tur\'an density results where we forbid certain induced subgraphs: \pi(F_{3,2}, induced K_4^-)=3/8 and \pi(K_5, 5-set spanning 8 edges)=3/4. The latter result is an analogue for K_5 of Razborov's result that \pi(K_4, 4-set spanning 1 edge)=5/9. We give several new constructions, conjectures and bounds for Tur\'an densities of 3-graphs which should be of interest to researchers in the area. Our main tool is `Flagmatic', an implementation of Razborov's flag algebra calculus, which we are making publicly available. In a bid to make the power of Razborov's method more widely accessible, we have tried to make Flagmatic as user-friendly as possible, hoping to remove thereby the major hurdle that needs to be cleared before using the flag algebra calculus. Finally, we spend some time reflecting on the limitations of our approach, and in particular on which problems we may be unable to solve. Our discussion of the `complexity barrier' for the flag algebra calculus may be of general interest. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1110.1961;k-Sums in abelian groups; Benjamin Girard (IMJ),  Simon Griffiths (IMPA),  Yahya Ould Hamidoune (IMJ);  Given a finite subset A of an abelian group G, we study the set k \wedge A of all sums of k distinct elements of A. In this paper, we prove that |k \wedge A| >= |A| for all k in {2,...,|A|-2}, unless k is in {2,|A|-2} and A is a coset of an elementary 2-subgroup of G. Furthermore, we characterize those finite subsets A of G for which |k \wedge A| = |A| for some k in {2,...,|A|-2}. This result answers a question of Diderrich. Our proof relies on an elementary property of proper edge-colourings of the complete graph. ;"Combinatorics (math.CO); Group Theory (math.GR); Number Theory (math.NT)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1110.2014;The L^1-norm of exponential sums in Z^d; Giorgis Petridis;  Let A be a finite set of integers and F_A its exponential sum. McGehee, Pigno & Smith and Konyagin have independently proved that the L^1-norm of F_A is at least c log|A| for some absolute constant c. The lower bound has the correct order of magnitude and was first conjectured by Littlewood. In this paper we present lower bounds on the L^1-norm of exponential sums of sets in the d-dimensional grid Z^d. We show that the L^1-norm of F_A is considerably larger than log|A| when A is a subset of Z^d with multidimensional structure. We furthermore prove similar lower bounds for sets in Z, which in a technical sense are multidimensional and discuss their connection to an inverse result on the theorem of McGehee, Pigno & Smith and Konyagin. ;"Combinatorics (math.CO); Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1110.2028;Remoteness of permutation codes; Peter J. Cameron,  Maximilien Gadouleau;  In this paper, we introduce a new parameter of a code, referred to as the remoteness, which can be viewed as a dual to the covering radius. Indeed, the remoteness is the minimum radius needed for a single ball to cover all codewords. After giving some general results about the remoteness, we then focus on the remoteness of permutation codes. We first derive upper and lower bounds on the minimum cardinality of a code with a given remoteness. We then study the remoteness of permutation groups. We show that the remoteness of transitive groups can only take two values, and we determine the remoteness of transitive groups of odd order. We finally show that the problem of determining the remoteness of a given transitive group is equivalent to determining the stability number of a related graph. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

We begin by finding recurrence relations for several simple tree patterns; then, for more complex trees, we compute generating functions by extending a known algorithm for pattern-avoiding binary trees. Next, we present an alternate one-dimensional notation for trees which we use to find bijections that explain why certain pairs of tree patterns yield the same avoidance generating function. Finally, we compare our bijections to known ""replacement rules"" for binary trees and generalize these bijections to a larger class of trees. ";Combinatorics (math.CO)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1110.2235;On distance, geodesic and arc transitivity of graphs; Alice Devillers,  Wei Jin,  Cai Heng Li,  Cheryl E. Praeger;  We compare three transitivity properties of finite graphs, namely, for a positive integer $s$, $s$-distance transitivity, $s$-geodesic transitivity and $s$-arc transitivity. It is known that if a finite graph is $s$-arc transitive but not $(s+1)$-arc transitive then $s\leq 7$ and $s\neq 6$. We show that there are infinitely many geodesic transitive graphs with this property for each of these values of $s$, and that these graphs can have arbitrarily large diameter if and only if $1\leq s\leq 3$. Moreover, for a prime $p$ we prove that there exists a graph of valency $p$ that is 2-geodesic transitive but not 2-arc transitive if and only if $p\equiv 1\pmod 4$, and for each such prime there is a unique graph with this property: it is an antipodal double cover of the complete graph $K_{p+1}$ and is geodesic transitive with automorphism group $PSL(2,p)\times Z_2$. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

Here we give an explicit description of the k-graph associated to a given skeleton and collection of squares and show that two k-graphs are isomorphic if and only if there is an isomorphism of their skeletons which preserves commuting squares. We use this to prove directly that each k-graph {\Lambda} is isomorphic to the quotient of the path category of its skeleton by the equivalence relation determined by the commuting squares, and show that this extends to a homeomorphism of infinite-path spaces when the k-graph is row finite with no sources. We conclude with a short direct proof of the characterisation, originally due to Robertson and Sims, of simplicity of the C*-algebra of a row-finite k-graph with no sources. ;"Combinatorics (math.CO); Operator Algebras (math.OA)"

In each subsequent round, each revolutionary may move to an adjacent vertex or not move, and then each spy has the same option. The revolutionaries want to hold an {\it unguarded meeting}, meaning $m$ revolutionaries at some vertex having no spy at the end of a round. To prevent this forever, trivially at least $\min\{|V(G)|,\FL{r/m}\}$ spies are needed. When $G$ is a tree, this many spies suffices. When $G$ is a unicyclic graph, $\min\{|V(G)|,\CL{r/m}\}$ spies suffice, and we characterize those unicyclic graphs where $\FL{r/m}+1$ spies are needed. \def\FL#1{\lfloor #1 \rfloor} \def\CL#1{\lceil #1 \rceil} ;"Combinatorics (math.CO); Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM)"

Say a graph is good if it admits a good edge-labelling, and is bad otherwise. Our main result is that any good n-vertex graph whose maximum degree is within a constant factor of its average degree (in particular, any good regular graph) has at most n^{1+o(1)} edges. As a corollary, we show that there are bad graphs with arbitrarily large girth, answering a question of Bode, Farzad and Theis. We also prove that for any Delta, there is a g such that any graph with maximum degree at most Delta and girth at least g is good. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1110.2806;A finite generating set for the genus g (p,q,n)-dipole series from  perturbative Yang-Mills theory; D. M. Jackson,  C. A. Sloss;  There is an emerging class of permutation factorization questions that cannot be expressed wholly in terms of the centre of the group algebra of the symmetric group. We shall term these non-central. A notable instance appears in recent work of Constable et al. [1] in perturbative Yang-Mills theory on the determination of a 2-point correlation function of the Berenstein-Maldacena-Nastase operators by means of Feynman diagrams. In combinatorial terms, this question relates to (p, q, n)-dipoles: loopless maps with exactly two vertices and n edges, with two distinguished edges, separated by p edges at one vertex and q edges at the other. By the introduction of join and cut operators, we construct a formal partial differential equation which uniquely determines a generating series from which the (p,q,n)-dipole series may be obtained. Moreover, we exhibit a set of functions with the property that the genus g solution to this equation may be obtained recursively as an explicit finite linear combination of these. These functions have explicit expressions as sums indexed by elementary combinatorial objects, and we demonstrate how the recursion can be used to give series solutions for surfaces of low genera. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

In classifying the strongly testable graph properties, the first author and Shapira showed that any hereditary graph property (such as P the family of perfect graphs) is strongly testable. A property is easily testable if it is strongly testable with query complexity bounded by a polynomial function of \epsilon^{-1}, and otherwise it is hard. One of our main results shows that testing perfectness is hard. The proof shows that testing perfectness is at least as hard as testing triangle-freeness, which is hard. On the other hand, we show that induced P_3-freeness is easily testable. This settles one of the two exceptional graphs, the other being C_4 (and its complement), left open in the characterization by the first author and Shapira of graphs H for which induced H-freeness is easily testable. ;"Combinatorics (math.CO); Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM); Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.00141;The distinguishing number of groups based on the distinguishing number  of subgroups; Saeid Alikhani,  Samaneh Soltani;  Let $\Gamma$ be a group acting on a set $X$. The distinguishing number for this action of $\Gamma$ on $X$, denoted by $D_{\Gamma}(X)$, is the smallest natural number $k$ such that the elements of $X$ can be labeled with $k$ labels so that any label-preserving element of $\Gamma$ fixes all $x \in X$. In particular, if the action is faithful, then the only element of $\Gamma$ preserving labels is the identity. In this paper, we obtain an upper bound on the distinguishing number of a set knowing the distinguishing number of a set under the action of a subgroup. By the concept of motion, we obtain an upper bound for the distinguishing number of a group. Motivated by a problem (Chan 2006), we characterize $D_{\Gamma,H}(X)$ which is the smallest number of labels admitting a labeling of $X$ such that the only elements of $\Gamma$ that induce label-preserving permutations lie in $H$.

Our main result is that for every even integer $k \ge 4$, there exists $c>0$ such that the number of triple systems with vertex set $[n]$ containing no $C_{k}$ is at most $2^{cn^2}$. An easy construction shows that the exponent is sharp in order of magnitude. This may be viewed as a hypergraph extension of the work of Morris and Saxton, who proved the analogous result for graphs which was a longstanding problem. For $r$-uniform hypergraphs with $r>3$, we improve the trivial upper bound but fall short of obtaining the order of magnitude in the exponent, which we conjecture is $n^{r-1}$. Our proof method is different than that used for most recent results of a similar flavor about enumerating discrete structures, since it does not use hypergraph containers. One novel ingredient is the use of some (new) quantitative estimates for an asymmetric version of the bipartite canonical Ramsey theorem. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

This study considers the expansions of restricted words $\omega$ in $W$ over the sequences $\{(xD)^{k}\}_{k\ge 0}$ and $\{xD^{k}x^{k-1}\}_{k\ge 0}$. Interestingly, the coefficients in individual expansions turn out to be generalizations of the Stirling numbers of the first kind and the Lah numbers. The coefficients will be determined through enumerations of some combinatorial structures linked to the words $\omega$, involving decreasing forest decompositions of quasi-threshold graphs and non-attacking rook placements on Ferrers boards. Extended to $q$-analogues, weighted refinements of the combinatorial interpretations are also investigated for words in the $q$-deformed Weyl algebra. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.00614;Coloring graphs of various maximum degree from random lists; Carl Johan Casselgren;  Let $G=G(n)$ be a graph on $n$ vertices with maximum degree $\Delta=\Delta(n)$. Assign to each vertex $v$ of $G$ a list $L(v)$ of colors by choosing each list independently and uniformly at random from all $k$-subsets of a color set $\mathcal{C}$ of size $\sigma= \sigma(n)$. Such a list assignment is called a \emph{random $(k,\mathcal{C})$-list assignment}. In this paper, we are interested in determining the asymptotic probability (as $n \to \infty$) of the existence of a proper coloring $\varphi$ of $G$, such that $\varphi(v) \in L(v)$ for every vertex $v$ of $G$, a so-called $L$-coloring. We give various lower bounds on $\sigma$, in terms of $n$, $k$ and $\Delta$, which ensures that with probability tending to 1 as $n \to \infty$ there is an $L$-coloring of $G$. In particular, we show, for all fixed $k$ and growing $n$, that if $\sigma(n) = \omega(n^{1/k^2} \Delta^{1/k})$ and $\Delta=O\left(n^{\frac{k-1}{k(k^3+ 2k^2 - k +1)}}\right)$, then the probability that $G$ has an $L$-coloring tends to 1 as $n \rightarrow \infty$. If $k\geq 2$ and $\Delta= \Omega(n^{1/2})$, then the same conclusion holds provided that $\sigma=\omega(\Delta)$. We also give related results for other bounds on $\Delta$, when $k$ is constant or a strictly increasing function of $n$. ;"Combinatorics (math.CO); Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM)"

We show that for any finite odd-sized collection of translates of P, the area of the set of points lying in an odd number of these translates is bounded away from 0 by a constant depending on P alone. The key ingredient of the proof is a construction of an odd cover of the plane by translates of P. That is, we establish a family F of translates of P covering (almost) every point in the plane a uniformly bounded odd number of times. ;"Combinatorics (math.CO); Metric Geometry (math.MG)"

We generalize the results conjectured in [Chinese Journal of Physics, 54 (4), 635-649 (2016)] and [International Journal of Modern Physics, arXiv:1608.06178] for an arbitrary order Cayley tree. We establish existence and a full classification of translation invariant Gibbs measures with memory of length 2 associated with the model on arbitrary order Cayley tree. We construct the recurrence equations corresponding generalized ANNNI model. We satisfy the Kolmogorov \emph{consistency} condition. We propose a rigorous measure-theoretical approach to investigate the Gibbs measures with memory of length 2 for the model. We explain whether the number of branches of tree does not change the number of Gibbs measures. Also we take up with trying to determine when phase transition does occur. ;"Combinatorics (math.CO); Dynamical Systems (math.DS); Probability (math.PR)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.00928;Counting Lyndon factors; Amy Glen,  Jamie Simpson,  W. F. Smyth;"  In this paper, we determine the maximum number of distinct Lyndon factors that a word of length $n$ can contain. We also derive formulas for the expected total number of Lyndon factors in a word of length $n$ on an alphabet of size $\sigma$, as well as the expected number of distinct Lyndon factors in such a word. The minimum number of distinct Lyndon factors in a word of length $n$ is $1$ and the minimum total number is $n$, with both bounds being achieved by $x^n$ where $x$ is a letter. A more interesting question to ask is what is the minimum number of distinct Lyndon factors in a Lyndon word of length $n$? In this direction, it is known (Saari, 2014) that an optimal lower bound for the number of distinct Lyndon factors in a Lyndon word of length $n$ is $\lceil\log_{\phi}(n) + 1\rceil$, where $\phi$ denotes the golden ratio $(1 + \sqrt{5})/2$. Moreover, this lower bound is attained by the so-called finite ""Fibonacci Lyndon words"", which are precisely the Lyndon factors of the well-known ""infinite Fibonacci word"" -- a special example of a ""infinite Sturmian word"". Saari (2014) conjectured that if $w$ is Lyndon word of length $n$, $n\ne 6$, containing the least number of distinct Lyndon factors over all Lyndon words of the same length, then $w$ is a Christoffel word (i.e., a Lyndon factor of an infinite Sturmian word). We give a counterexample to this conjecture. Furthermore, we generalise Saari's result on the number of distinct Lyndon factors of a Fibonacci Lyndon word by determining the number of distinct Lyndon factors of a given Christoffel word. We end with two open problems. ";"Combinatorics (math.CO); Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM)"

The Jacobian group ${\rm Jac}(M)$ of $M$ is a finite abelian group whose cardinality is equal to the number of bases of $M$. This group generalizes the definition of the Jacobian group (also known as the critical group or sandpile group) ${\rm Jac}(G)$ of a graph $G$ (in which case bases of the corresponding regular matroid are spanning trees of $G$). There are many explicit combinatorial bijections in the literature between the Jacobian group of a graph ${\rm Jac}(G)$ and spanning trees. However, most of the known bijections use vertices of $G$ in some essential way and are inherently ""non-matroidal"". In this paper, we construct a family of explicit and easy-to-describe bijections between the Jacobian group of a regular matroid $M$ and bases of $M$, many instances of which are new even in the case of graphs. We first describe our family of bijections in a purely combinatorial way in terms of orientations; more specifically, we prove that the Jacobian group of $M$ admits a canonical simply transitive action on the set ${\mathcal G}(M)$ of circuit-cocircuit reversal classes of $M$, and then define a family of combinatorial bijections $\beta_{\sigma,\sigma^*}$ between ${\mathcal G}(M)$ and bases of $M$. (Here $\sigma$ (resp. $\sigma^*$) is an acyclic signature of the set of circuits (resp. cocircuits) of $M$.) We then give a geometric interpretation of each such map $\beta=\beta_{\sigma,\sigma^*}$ in terms of zonotopal subdivisions which is used to verify that $\beta$ is indeed a bijection. Finally, we give a combinatorial interpretation of lattice points in the zonotope $Z$; by passing to dilations we obtain a new derivation of Stanley's formula linking the Ehrhart polynomial of $Z$ to the Tutte polynomial of $M$.

Willis;"  Let lambda be a partition with no more than n parts. Let beta be a weakly increasing n-tuple with entries from {1,..,n}. The flagged Schur function in the variables x_1, .., x_n that is indexed by lambda and beta has been defined to be the sum of the content weight monomials for the semistandard Young tableaux of shape lambda whose values are row-wise bounded by the entries of beta. Gessel and Viennot gave a determinant expression for the flagged Schur function indexed by lambda and beta; this could be done since the pair (lambda,beta) satisfied their ""nonpermutable"" condition for the sequence of terminals of an n-tuple of certain lattice paths that they used to model the tableaux. We generalize the notion of flagged Schur function by dropping the requirement that lambda be weakly increasing. Then we give a condition on the entries of lambda and beta for the pair (lambda,beta) to be nonpermutable that is both necessary and sufficient. When the parts of lambda are not distinct there will be multiple row bound n-tuples that will produce the same polynomial via the sum of tableau weights construction on lambda. We accordingly group the bounding n-tuples into equivalence classes and identify the most efficient n-tuple in each class for the determinant computation. We have recently shown that many other sets of objects that are indexed by n and lambda are enumerated by the number of these efficient n-tuples. It is noted that the GL(n) Demazure characters (key polynomials) indexed by 312-avoiding permutations can also be expressed with these determinants. ";Combinatorics (math.CO)

This enables us to show that for any operads P and Q having the same underlying S-module, there exists a generalised mixed distributive law $\lambda$ such that any connected P coQ-bialgebra satisfying $\lambda$ is free and cofree over its primitive elements. Our reasoning permits us to generate many new examples, while recovering the known ones by considering dual relations. ;"Combinatorics (math.CO); Rings and Algebras (math.RA)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01362;Locally infinite graphs and symmetries; Sébastien Martineau;"  When one studies geometric properties of graphs, local finiteness is a common implicit assumption, and that of transitivity a frequent explicit one. By compactness arguments, local finiteness guarantees several regularity properties. It is generally easy to find counterexamples to such regularity results when the assumption of local finiteness is dropped. The present work focuses on the following problem: determining whether these regularity properties still hold when local finiteness is replaced by an assumption of transitivity. After recalling the locally finite situation, we show that there are Cayley graphs with infinite generating systems that have infinite diameter but do not contain any infinite geodesic ray. We also introduce a notion of generalised diameter. The generalised diameter of a graph is either an ordinal or ""truly infinite"" and captures the extension properties of geodesic paths. It is a finite ordinal if and only if the usual diameter is finite, and in that case the two notions agree. Besides, the generalised diameter is ""truly infinite"" if and only if the considered graph contains an infinite geodesic ray. We show that there exist Cayley graphs of abelian groups of arbitrary generalised diameter. Finally, we build Cayley graphs of abelian groups that have isomorphic balls of radius R for every R but are not globally isomorphic. This enables us to construct a non-transitive graph such that for every R and any vertices u and v, the ball of centre u and radius R is isomorphic to that of centre v and same radius.

Applying probabilistic tools we improve the upper bound on the smallest possible size of the saturating set to $(1+o(1))\sqrt{3q\ln{q}}$.

In the transportation problems one wishes to find a matrix A with row sum vector R and column sum vector S. If, in addition, the two vectors only contain nonnegative integers then one wants the same to be true for A. This can always be done and the transportation algorithm gives a method for explicitly calculating A. We can restrict things even further and insist that A have only entries zero and one. In this case, the Gale-Ryser Theorem gives necessary and sufficient conditions for A to exist and this result can be proved constructively. One can let the dihedral group D_4 of the square act on matrices. Then a subgroup of D_4 defines a set of matrices invariant under the subgroup. So one can consider analogues of the transportation and (0,1) problems for these sets of matrices. For every subgroup, we give conditions equivalent to the existence of the desired type of matrix. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

Erdos, Saks and Sos show that line graphs of specific trees almost have smallest values of t(G) over all graphs thirty years ago. It is shown that if G is the line graph of tree T, then t(G) equals to the diameter of T. An interesting question is that how large the gap can be between t(L(G)) and f(L(G)) over line graphs. It turns out that the problem is equivalent to finding maximum linear forests in trees with given diameter. In this paper, we give lower and upper bounds on f(L(G)) by functions of t(L(G)) over all line graphs and construct extremal graphs that achieve these bounds. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

In this paper we make some remarks on this conjecture. Firstly, we can improve the trivial lower bound of $\frac{1}{2n}$ slightly for large $n$, to $\frac{1}{2n} + \frac{c \log n}{n^2 (\log\log n)^2}$ for some absolute constant $c>0$; previous improvements were roughly of the form $\frac{1}{2n} + \frac{c}{n^2}$. Secondly, we show that to verify the conjecture, it suffices to do so under the assumption that the speeds are integers of size $n^{O(n^2)}$. We also obtain some results in the case when all the velocities are integers of size $O(n)$. ";Combinatorics (math.CO)

It is an open question, raised by Alavi, Malde, Schwenk and Erd\H{o}s, whether the sequence $(i_T(t))_{t \geq 0}$ is always unimodal. Here we answer the question in the affirmative for some recursively defined families of trees, specifically paths with auxiliary trees dropped from the vertices in a periodic manner. In particular, extending a result of Wang and B.-X. Zhu, we show unimodality of the independent set sequence of a path on $2n$ vertices with $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ pendant edges dropped alternately from the vertices of the path, $\ell_1, \ell_2$ arbitrary. We also show that the independent set sequence of any tree becomes unimodal if sufficiently many pendant edges are dropped from any single vertex, or if $k$ pendant edges are dropped from every vertex, for sufficiently large $k$. This in particular implies the unimodality of the independent set sequence of some non-periodic caterpillars. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02325;Shuffled equi-n-squares; M. Van de Vel (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and Universiteit Antwerpen);  A formal n-square is the set of positions in an square matrix of size n. A shuffle of a formal n-square consists of independent rotations of each row and of each column. A key result turns out to be valid at least for n <= 34 and n = 37: Each set of n positions can be mapped with one shuffle onto a transversal of the columns. We consider two applications to equi-n-squares (i.e., n-matrices filled with digits 0, .., n - 1 in equal amounts). First, a shuffled equi-n-square can be seen as a torus with n colors and two orthogonal layers of n rings that can be rotated. Unlike Rubik's cube, each permutation of colored cells can be implemented with shuffles. An upper bound of $3*(-1)^{n-1} + 6n$ shuffles is derived from the key result. Our second application invokes column transversals and a process of indirection to produce theoretically unpredictable sequences of integers in shuffled equi-n-squares. Our proof of the key result involves optimizing position sets, averaging, computations based on number partitions, rotating subsets of a regular $n$-gon apart, and the use of cyclotomic polynomials. A few intermediate results need computer assistence. These efforts also generated a variety of (partially) unsolved problems. We selected eight of these for a brief discussion based on the available theoretical and computer evidence. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

It enables us to define graph orthogonality and a new metrics on graphs. Furthermore, it enables us to define the coordinate representation of graphs with respect to an ordered set of graphs, which benefits us in the graph isomorphism problem. If any graph of set $A$ has a unique coordinates with respect to a graph set $ B$, then, we call $B$ is a basis for the graphs set $A$. Having a basis, any graph finds a unique coordinates. Thus, the graph isomorphism problem equals to comparison of the coordinates. This fact provides a formal approach to study the computational complexity of the graph isomorphism problem, i.e. finding a suitable basis. We have shown that graphs on at most 3log(n) vertices make a basis for almost every $n$-vertex graphs. This fact, easily, results that graph isomorphism problem can be solved in $\exp(6\log^2(n))$ time for almost every pair of $n$-vertex graphs. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02509;Tangle-tree duality in abstract separation systems; Reinhard Diestel,  Sang-il Oum;  We prove a general width duality theorem for combinatorial structures with well-defined notions of cohesion and separation, such as graphs and matroids. The theorem asserts a duality between the existence of high cohesiveness somewhere local and a global overall tree structure. We describe cohesive substructures in a unified way in the format of tangles: as orientations of low-order separations satisfying certain consistency axioms. These axioms can be expressed without reference to the underlying structure, such as a graph or matroid, but just in terms of the poset of the separations themselves. This makes it becomes possible to identify tangles, and apply our tangle-tree duality theorem, in very diverse settings. Our result implies all the classical duality theorems for width parameters in graph minor theory, such as path-width, tree-width, branch-width or rank-width. It yields new, tangle-type, duality theorems for tree-width and path-width. It implies the existence of width parameters dual to cohesive substructures such as $k$-blocks, edge-tangles, or given subsets of tangles, for which no width duality theorems were previously known. Abstract separation systems can be found also in structures quite unlike graphs and matroids. For example, our theorem can be applied to image analysis by capturing the regions of an image as tangles of separations defined as natural partitions of its set of pixels. It could also be applied in pure mathematics, e.g.\ to separations of compact manifolds. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

Let $\Gamma_{(t|X)}$ be the vertex operator defined by $\Gamma_{(t|X)} s_\alpha =\sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} s_{(n,\alpha)} [X] t^n$. We provide a combinatorial proof for the identity $\Gamma_{(t|X)} s_\alpha = \sigma[tX] s_{\alpha}\big[x-1/t\big] $ due to Thibon et al. We include an overview of all the combinatorial ideas behind this beautiful identity, including a combinatorial description for the expansion of $s_{(n,\alpha)} [X] $ in the Schur basis, for any integer value of $n$. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02651;Tangle-tree duality: in graphs, matroids and beyond; Reinhard Diestel,  Sang-il Oum;  We apply a recent duality theorem for tangles in abstract separation systems to derive tangle-type duality theorems for width-parameters in graphs and matroids. We further derive a duality theorem for the existence of clusters in large data sets. Our applications to graphs include new, tangle-type, duality theorems for tree-width, path-width, and tree-decompositions of small adhesion. Conversely, we show that carving width is dual to edge-tangles. For matroids we obtain a duality theorem for tree-width. Our results can be used to derive short proofs of all the classical duality theorems for width parameters in graph minor theory, such as path-width, tree-width, branch-width and rank-width. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02693;Clique colourings of geometric graphs; Colin McDiarmid,  Dieter Mitsche,  Pawel Pralat;  A clique colouring of a graph is a colouring of the vertices such that no maximal clique is monochromatic (ignoring isolated vertices). The least number of colours in such a colouring is the clique chromatic number. Given $n$ points $x_1, \ldots,x_n$ in the plane, and a threshold $r>0$, the corresponding geometric graph has vertex set $\{v_1,\ldots,v_n\}$, and distinct $v_i$ and $v_j$ are adjacent when the Euclidean distance between $x_i$ and $x_j$ is at most $r$. We investigate the clique chromatic number of such graphs. We first show that the clique chromatic number is at most 9 for any geometric graph in the plane, and briefly consider geometric graphs in higher dimensions. Then we study the asymptotic behaviour of the clique chromatic number for the random geometric graph $RG$ in the plane, where $n$ random points are independently and uniformly distributed in a suitable square. We see that as $r$ increases from 0, with high probability the clique chromatic number is 1 for very small $r$, then 2 for small $r$, then at least 3 for larger $r$, and finally drops back to 2. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

We determine that the upper bound for the minimum value of the sum-Balaban index is at most $4.47934$ when $n$ goes to infinity. For small values of $n$ we determine the extremal graphs and we observe that they are similar to dumbbell graphs, in most cases having one extra edge added to the corresponding extreme for the usual Balaban index. We show that in the class of balanced dumbbell graphs, those with clique sizes $\sqrt[4]{\sqrt 2\log\big(1+\sqrt 2\big)}\sqrt n+o(\sqrt n)$ have asymptotically the smallest value of sum-Balaban index. We pose several conjectures and problems regarding this topic. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

We study properties of the graph $\boldsymbol{G}_{\boldsymbol{S}}$ both when $\boldsymbol{S}$ is a join-semilattice and when it is a lattice. We call a $\langle 0, \vee \rangle$-semilattice $\boldsymbol{S}$ particle provided that the set of its join-irreducible elements join-generates $\boldsymbol{S}$ and it satisfies DCC. We prove that the congruence lattice of a particle lattice is anti-isomorphic to the lattice of hereditary subsets of the corresponding graph that are closed in a certain zero-dimensional topology. Thus we extend the result known for principally chain finite lattices. ;"Combinatorics (math.CO); Rings and Algebras (math.RA)"

We generalize the concept of sum and introduce $\cH$-combinations of impartial games for any hypergraph $\cH$. In particular, we introduce the game $NIM_\cH$ which is the $\cH$-combination of single pile $NIM$ games. An impartial game is called SG decreasing if its SG value is decreased by every move. Extending the SG theory, we reduce the $\cH$-combination of SG decreasing games to $NIM_\cH$. We call $\cH$ a Tetris hypergraph if $NIM_\cH$ is SG decreasing. We provide some necessary and some sufficient conditions for a hypergraph to be Tetris. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02824;Schur P-positivity and involution Stanley symmetric functions; Zachary Hamaker,  Eric Marberg,  Brendan Pawlowski;  The involution Stanley symmetric functions $\hat{F}_y$ are the stable limits of the analogues of Schubert polynomials for the orbits of the orthogonal group in the flag variety. These symmetric functions are also generating functions for involution words, and are indexed by the involutions in the symmetric group. By construction each $\hat{F}_y$ is a sum of Stanley symmetric functions and therefore Schur positive. We prove the stronger fact that these power series are Schur $P$-positive. We give an algorithm to efficiently compute the decomposition of $\hat{F}_y$ into Schur $P$-summands, and prove that this decomposition is triangular with respect to the dominance order on partitions. As an application, we derive pattern avoidance conditions which characterize the involution Stanley symmetric functions which are equal to Schur $P$-functions. We deduce as a corollary that the involution Stanley symmetric function of the reverse permutation is a Schur $P$-function indexed by a shifted staircase shape. These results lead to alternate proofs of theorems of Ardila-Serrano and DeWitt on skew Schur functions which are Schur $P$-functions. We also prove new Pfaffian formulas for certain related involution Schubert polynomials. ;"Combinatorics (math.CO); Representation Theory (math.RT)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02844;Selecting optimal minimum spanning trees that share a topological  correspondence with phylogenetic trees; Prabhav Kalaghatgi,  Thomas Lengauer;  Choi et. al (2011) introduced a minimum spanning tree (MST)-based method called CLGrouping, for constructing tree-structured probabilistic graphical models, a statistical framework that is commonly used for inferring phylogenetic trees. While CLGrouping works correctly if there is a unique MST, we observe an indeterminacy in the method in the case that there are multiple MSTs. In this work we remove this indeterminacy by introducing so-called vertex-ranked MSTs. We note that the effectiveness of CLGrouping is inversely related to the number of leaves in the MST. This motivates the problem of finding a vertex-ranked MST with the minimum number of leaves (MLVRMST). We provide a polynomial time algorithm for the MLVRMST problem, and prove its correctness for graphs whose edges are weighted with tree-additive distances. ;"Combinatorics (math.CO); Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)"

Among the all topological indices the Randi\'c and the Zagreb indices have been used more considerably than any other topological indices in chemical and mathematical literature. Most of the topological indices as in the Randi\'c and the Zagreb indices are based on the degrees of the vertices of a connected graph. Recently novel two degree concepts have been defined in graph theory; ev-degrees and ve-degrees. In this study we define ev-degree Zagreb index, ve-degree Zagreb indices and ve-degree Randi\'c index by using these new graph invariants as parallel to their corresponding classical degree versions. We compare these new group ev-degree and ve-degree indices with the other well-known and most used topological indices in literature such as; Wiener, Zagreb and Randi\'c indices by modelling some physicochemical properties of octane isomers. We show that the ev-degree Zagreb index, the ve-degree Zagreb and the ve-degree Randi\'c indices give better correlation than Wiener, Zagreb and Randi\'c indices to predict the some specific physicochemical properties of octanes. We investigate the relations between the second Zagreb index and ev-degree and ve-degree Zagreb indices and some mathematical properties of ev-degree and ve-degree Zagreb indices.

The maximum size of a $P$-saturated family is denoted by $La(n,P)$, which has been studied for a number of choices of $P$. The minimum size of a $P$-saturated family, $sat(n,P)$, was introduced by Gerbner et al. (2013), and parallels the deep literature on the saturation function for graphs. We introduce and study the concept of saturation for induced subposets. As opposed to induced saturation in graphs, the above definition of saturation for posets extends naturally to the induced setting. We give several exact results and a number of bounds on the induced saturation number for several small posets. We also use a transformation to the biclique cover problem to prove a logarithmic lower bound for a rich infinite family of target posets. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

In the case when ${\mathcal G}$ consists of subspaces whose dimension and codimension both are infinite, a such kind result will be proved also for the connected components of the associated Grassmann graph. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

In this paper we determine the symmetric partially metric association schemes with a multiplicity three. Besides the association schemes related to regular complete $4$-partite graphs, we obtain the association schemes related to the Platonic solids, the bipartite double scheme of the dodecahedron, and three association schemes that are related to well-known $2$-arc-transitive covers of the cube: the M\""{o}bius-Kantor graph, the Nauru graph, and the Foster graph F048A. In order to obtain this result, we also determine the symmetric association schemes with a multiplicity three and a connected relation with valency three. Moreover, we construct an infinite family of cubic arc-transitive $2$-walk-regular graphs with an eigenvalue with multiplicity three that give rise to non-commutative association schemes with a symmetric relation of valency three and an eigenvalue with multiplicity three.

In this note, we prove this conjecture when each vector contains at most two non-zero entries. As an application, we prove several results on flows in highly edge-connected graphs, extending known results. For instance, assume that $p\ge 3$ is a prime number and $\vec{G}$ is a directed, highly edge-connected graph in which each arc is given a list of two distinct values in $\mathbb{Z}_p$. Then $\vec{G}$ has a $\mathbb{Z}_p$-flow in which each arc is assigned a value of its own list. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

More precisely, we state the following. Let $G$ be a simple graph of order $n$ such that its complement has exactly $a(G)$ subgraphs isomorphic to $K_{2p,2q}$ and exactly $b(G)$ subgraphs isomorphic to $K_{2p+1,2q+1}$. Then $d(G) = 2^n -1 + 2[a(G)-b(G)]$. We also show some new relations between the domination polynomial and the neighborhood polynomial of a graph. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.03846;Finitely forcible graph limits are universal; Jacob W. Cooper,  Daniel Kral,  Taisa L. Martins;"  The theory of graph limits represents large graphs by an analytic object called a graphon. Graph limits determined by finitely many graph densities, which are represented by finitely forcible graphons, arise in various scenarios, particularly within extremal combinatorics. Lovasz and Szegedy conjectured that all such graphons possess a simple structure, e.g., the space of their typical vertices is always finite dimensional; this was disproved by several ad hoc constructions of complex finitely forcible graphons. We prove that any graphon is a subgraphon of a finitely forcible graphon. This dismisses any hope for a result showing that finitely forcible graphons possess a simple structure, and is surprising when contrasted with the fact that finitely forcible graphons form a meager set in the space of all graphons. In addition, since any finitely forcible graphon represents the unique minimizer of some linear combination of densities of subgraphs, our result also shows that such minimization problems, which conceptually are among the simplest kind within extremal graph theory, may in fact have unique optimal solutions with arbitrarily complex structure.

A multigraph $G$ is star $k$-edge-colorable if $\chi'_{s}(G)\le k$. Dvo\v{r}\'ak, Mohar and \v{S}\'amal [Star chromatic index, J. Graph Theory 72 (2013), 313--326] proved that every subcubic multigraph is star $7$-edge-colorable. They conjectured in the same paper that every subcubic multigraph should be star $6$-edge-colorable. In this paper, we first prove that it is NP-complete to determine whether $\chi'_s(G)\le3$ for an arbitrary graph $G$. This answers a question of Mohar. We then establish some structure results on subcubic multigraphs $G$ with $\delta(G)\le2$ such that $\chi'_s(G)>k$ but $\chi'_s(G-v)\le k$ for any $v\in V(G)$, where $k\in\{5,6\}$. We finally apply the structure results, along with a simple discharging method, to prove that every subcubic multigraph $G$ is star $6$-edge-colorable if $mad(G)<5/2$, and star $5$-edge-colorable if $mad(G)<24/11$, respectively, where $mad(G)$ is the maximum average degree of a multigraph $G$.

A classical result in extremal combinatorics due to Erd\H os, Ko, and Rado determines the maximum size of an intersecting family of $k$-subsets of $\{1,\ldots, n\}$. In this paper we study the following problem: how many intersecting families of $k$-subsets of $n$ are there? Improving the result of Balogh et al., we determine the asymptotic of this quantity for $n\ge 2k+2+2\sqrt{k\log k}$ and $k\to \infty$. Moreover, in the same assumptions we also determine the asymptotic of the number of {\it non-trivial} intersecting families, that the intersecting families in which the intersection of all sets is empty. We obtain analogous results for pairs of cross-intersecting families. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

An edge-coloring of a graph is repetition-free or nonrepetitive if there is no path with a color pattern that is a repetition. The minimum number of colors so that a graph has a nonrepetitive edge-coloring is called its Thue edge-chromatic number. We improve on the best known general upper bound of $4\Delta-4$ for the Thue edge-chromatic number of trees of maximum degree $\Delta$ due to Alon, Grytczuk, Ha{\l}uszczak and Riordan (2002) by providing a simple nonrepetitive edge-coloring with $3\Delta-2$ colors. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

The topic of rainbow connection in graphs drew much attention and various similar parameters were introduced, mostly dealing with undirected graphs. Dorbec, Schiermeyer, Sidorowicz and Sopena extended the concept of the rainbow connection to digraphs. In this paper, we consider the (strong) rainbow vertex-connection number of digraphs.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04471;Signed edge domination numbers of complete tripartite graphs: Part 2; Abdollah Khodkar;  The closed neighborhood $N_G[e]$ of an edge $e$ in a graph $G$ is the set consisting of $e$ and of all edges having an end-vertex in common with $e$. Let $f$ be a function on $E(G)$, the edge set of $G$, into the set $\{-1,1\}$. If $\sum_{x\in{N[e]}}f(x)\geq 1$ for each edge $e \in E(G)$, then $f$ is called a signed edge dominating function of $G$. The signed edge domination number of $G$ is the minimum weight of a signed edge dominating function of $G$. In this paper, we find the signed edge domination number of the complete tripartite graph $K_{m,n,p}$, where $1\leq m\leq n$ and $p\geq m+n$.

These walks are shown to be closely related to rotation systems and 1-factorizations of graphs. For two of the models, we compute the traces and total entropies of the average mixing matrices for some cubic graphs. The trace captures how likely a quantum walk is to revisit the state it started with, and the total entropy measures how close the limiting distribution is to uniform. Our numerical results indicate three relations between quantum walks and graph structures: for the first model, rotation systems with higher genera give lower traces and higher entropies, and for the second model, the symmetric 1-factorizations always give the highest trace. ;"Combinatorics (math.CO); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

In this paper we use the recently developed slice rank method to show that any set $E\subset\mathcal{S}$ of size \[ |E|>(n+1)^{(q-1)(k-1)} \] contains a $k$-tuple of distinct mutually orthogonal vectors, where $n\geq\binom{k}{2}$ and $q=p^{r}$ with $p\geq k$. The key innovation is a more general version of the slice rank of a tensor, which we call the multi-slice rank. We use a combinatorial argument to create an appropriate indicator tensor for the orthogonality of $k$-vectors, however for $k\geq4$ this tensor will have large slice rank, and so to obtain our results we need to use the less restrictive multi-slice rank. Additionally, we use this method to generalize a recent result of Ge and Shangguan, and prove that any set $A\subset\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}$ of size \[ |A|>\binom{n+(q-1)(k-1)}{(q-1)(k-1)} \] contains a $k$-right-corner, that is distinct vectors $x_{1},\dots,x_{k},x_{k+1}$ where $x_{1}-x_{k+1},\dots,x_{k}-x_{k+1}$ are mutually orthogonal, as long as $n\geq\binom{k+1}{2}$ and $q=p^{r}$ with $p>k$. ;"Combinatorics (math.CO); Number Theory (math.NT)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04493;Weingarten calculus via orthogonality relations: new applications; Benoît Collins,  Sho Matsumoto;  Weingarten calculus is a completely general and explicit method to compute the moments of the Haar measure on compact subgroups of matrix algebras. Particular cases of this calculus were initiated by theoretical physicists -- including Weingarten, after whom this calculus was coined by the first author, after investigating it systematically. Substantial progress was achieved subsequently by the second author and coworkers, based on representation theoretic and combinatorial techniques. All formulas of `Weingarten calculus' are in the spirit of Weingarten's seminal paper [W78]. However, modern proofs are very different from Weingarten's initial ideas. In this paper, we revisit Weingarten's initial proof and we illustrate its power by uncovering two new important applications: (i) a uniform bound on the Weingarten function, that subsumes existing uniform bounds, and is optimal up to a polynomial factor, and (ii) an extension of Weingarten calculus to symmetric spaces and conceptual proofs of identities established by the second author. ;"Combinatorics (math.CO); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)"

This is equivalent to saying that the indecomposable flows on graphs are those graphic circuit flows. Turning from graphs to signed graphs, the indecomposable flows are much richer than those of unsigned graphs. This paper gives a complete description of indecomposable flows on signed graphs from the viewpoint of resolution of singularities by means of double covering graphs. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

We consider a property of curves called the stabbing number, defined to be the maximum countable number of intersections possible between the curve and a line in the plane. We show that large subsets of $X$ lying on Jordan curves of low stabbing number are an obstacle to equal separation. We further discuss Jordan curves of minimal stabbing number containing $X$.

In 1978, Deza, Erd\""{o}s and Frankl had given an equivalent version of the same for graphs: Let $G= \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} A_i$ denote a graph with $n$ complete graphs $A_1, A_2,$ $ \dots , A_n$, each having exactly $n$ vertices and have the property that every pair of complete graphs has at most one common vertex, then the chromatic number of $G$ is $n$. The clique degree $d^K(v)$ of a vertex $v$ in $G$ is given by $d^K(v) = |\{A_i: v \in V(A_i), 1 \leq i \leq n\}|$. In this paper we give a method for assigning colors to the graphs satisfying the hypothesis of the Erd\""os - Faber - Lov\'asz conjecture using intersection matrix of the cliques $A_i$'s of $G$ and clique degrees of the vertices of $G$.

Recently Balogh, Morris and Samotij, and independently Saxton and Thomason developed very general container theorems for independent sets in hypergraphs; both of which have seen numerous applications to a wide range of problems. In this paper we use the container method to prove results that correspond to problems concerning tuples of disjoint independent sets in hypergraphs. In particular: (i) We generalise the random Ramsey theorem of R\""odl and Ruci\'nski by providing a resilience analogue. This result also implies the random version of Tur\'an's theorem due to Conlon and Gowers and Schacht. (ii) We prove a general subcase of the asymmetric random Ramsey conjecture of Kohayakawa and Kreuter. (iii) Both of the above results in fact hold for uniform hypergraphs.

However, while double edge-swaps can transform, for any fixed degree sequence, any two graphs inside the classes of simple graphs, multigraphs, and pseudographs, this is not true for graphs which allow self-loops but not multiedges (loopy graphs). Indeed, we exactly characterize the degree sequences where double edge swaps cannot reach every valid loopy graph and develop an efficient algorithm to determine such degree sequences. The same classification scheme to characterize degree sequences can be used to prove that, for all degree sequences, loopy graphs are connected by a combination of double and triple edge swaps. Thus, we contribute the first MCMC sampler that uniformly samples loopy graphs with any given sequence. ;"Combinatorics (math.CO); Social and Information Networks (cs.SI); Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability (physics.data-an); Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)"

For a family ${\cal F}$ of sets, let $c(P,{\cal F})$ denote the number of copies of $P$ in ${\cal F}$, and we say that ${\cal F}$ is $P$-free if $c(P,{\cal F})=0$ holds. For any two posets $P,Q$ let us denote by $La(n,P,Q)$ the maximum number of copies of $Q$ over all $P$-free families ${\cal F} \subseteq 2^{[n]}$, i.e. $\max\{c(Q,{\cal F}): {\cal F} \subseteq 2^{[n]}, c(P,{\cal F})=0 \}$. This generalizes the well-studied parameter $La(n,P)=La(n,P,P_1)$ where $P_1$ is the one element poset. The quantity $La(n,P)$ has been determined (precisely or asymptotically) for many posets $P$, and in all known cases an asymptotically best construction can be obtained by taking as many middle levels as possible without creating a copy of $P$. In this paper we consider the first instances of the problem of determining $La(n,P,Q)$. We find its value when $P$ and $Q$ are small posets, like chains, forks, the $N$ poset and diamonds. Already these special cases show that the extremal families are completely different from those in the original $P$-free cases: sometimes not middle or consecutive levels maximize $La(n,P,Q)$ and sometimes no asymptotically extremal family is the union of levels. Finally, we determine the maximum number of copies of complete multi-level posets in $k$-Sperner families. The main tools for this are the profile polytope method and two extremal set system problems that are of independent interest: we maximize the number of $r$-tuples $A_1,A_2,\dots, A_r \in {\cal A}$ over all antichains ${\cal A}\subseteq 2^{[n]}$ such that (i) $\cap_{i=1}^rA_i=\emptyset$, (ii) $\cap_{i=1}^rA_i=\emptyset$ and $\cup_{i=1}^rA_i=[n]$. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

These special tableaux allow a systematic encoding of combinatorial properties in numerical algebraic ways, including algorithmic benefits. The interplay between these algebraic-combinatorial structures establishes a profound machinery for exploring semigroup attributes, in particular satisfying of semigroup identities. This machinery is utilized here to prove that $\mathcal{K}_n$ and $\, ^{\operatorname{co}} \mathcal{K}_n$ admit all the semigroup identities satisfied by $n \times n$ triangular tropical matrices, which holds also for $\mathcal{P}_3$. ;"Combinatorics (math.CO); Rings and Algebras (math.RA)"

Conjecture~1 is a claim about the uniqueness of certain monomial graphs. Conjecture~2, which implies Conjecture~1, deals with certain permutation polynomials of finite fields. Two natural strengthenings of Conjecture~2, referred to as Conjectures~A and B in the present paper, were also insinuated. In a recent development, Conjecture~2 and hence Conjecture~1 have been confirmed. The present paper gives a proof of Conjecture~A. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

Corresponding results are obtained for trees with given maximum degree and also for trees with given diameter. The problem of the maximum distance between the centroid and the subtree core among trees with given order and diameter becomes difficult. It can be solved in terms of the problem of minimizing the number of root-containing subtrees in a rooted tree of given order and height. While the latter problem remains unsolved, we provide a partial characterization of the extremal structure. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.05277;Specht Polytopes and Specht Matroids; John D. Wiltshire-Gordon,  Alexander Woo,  Magdalena Zajaczkowska;"  The generators of the classical Specht module satisfy intricate relations. We introduce the Specht matroid, which keeps track of these relations, and the Specht polytope, which also keeps track of convexity relations. We establish basic facts about the Specht polytope, for example, that the symmetric group acts transitively on its vertices and irreducibly on its ambient real vector space. A similar construction builds a matroid and polytope for a tensor product of Specht modules, giving ""Kronecker matroids"" and ""Kronecker polytopes"" instead of the usual Kronecker coefficients. We dub this process of upgrading numbers to matroids and polytopes ""matroidification,"" giving two more examples. In the course of describing these objects, we also give an elementary account of the construction of Specht modules different from the standard one. Finally, we provide code to compute with Specht matroids and their Chow rings. ";"Combinatorics (math.CO); Representation Theory (math.RT)"

Further corollaries include a characterization of topes of oriented matroids due to da Silva, another one of Handa, a characterization of lopsided systems due to Lawrence, and an intrinsic characterization of tope graphs of affine oriented matroids. Furthermore, we obtain polynomial time recognition algorithms for tope graphs of the above and a finite list of excluded partial cube minors for the bounded rank case. In particular, this answers a relatively long-standing open question in oriented matroids. ;"Combinatorics (math.CO); Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.05532;Tighter Bounds for the Discrepancy of Boxes and Polytopes; Aleksandar Nikolov;  Combinatorial discrepancy is a complexity measure of a collection of sets which quantifies how well the sets in the collection can be simultaneously balanced. More precisely, we are given an n-point set $P$, and a collection $\mathcal{F} = \{F_1, ..., F_m\}$ of subsets of $P$, and our goal is color $P$ with two colors, red and blue, so that the maximum over the $F_i$ of the absolute difference between the number of red elements and the number of blue elements (the discrepancy) is minimized. Combinatorial discrepancy has many applications in mathematics and computer science, including constructions of uniformly distributed point sets, and lower bounds for data structures and private data analysis algorithms. We investigate the combinatorial discrepancy of geometrically defined systems, in which $P$ is an n-point set in $d$-dimensional space ,and $\mathcal{F}$ is the collection of subsets of $P$ induced by dilations and translations of a fixed convex polytope $B$. Such set systems include systems of sets induced by axis-aligned boxes, whose discrepancy is the subject of the well known Tusnady problem. We prove new discrepancy upper and lower bounds for such set systems by extending the approach based on factorization norms previously used by the author and Matousek. We improve the best known upper bound for the Tusnady problem by a logarithmic factor, using a result of Banaszczyk on signed series of vectors. We extend this improvement to any arbitrary convex polytope $B$ by using a decomposition due to Matousek. Using Fourier analytic techniques, we also prove a nearly matching discrepancy lower bound for sets induced by any fixed bounded polytope $B$ satisfying a certain technical condition. We also outline applications of our results to geometric discrepancy, data structure lower bounds, and differential privacy. ;"Combinatorics (math.CO); Computational Geometry (cs.CG)"

We show that every graph in each of the following classes has a tree decomposition and a linear-sized path decomposition with bounded intersections: (1) every proper minor-closed class, (2) string graphs with a linear number of crossings in a fixed surface, (3) graphs with linear crossing number in a fixed surface. We then show that every $n$-vertex graph that has a tree decomposition and a linear-sized path decomposition with bounded intersections has $O(\sqrt{n})$ treewidth. As a corollary, we conclude a new lower bound on the crossing number of a graph in terms of its treewidth. Finally, we consider graph classes that have two path decompositions with bounded intersections. Trees and outerplanar graphs have this property. But for the next most simple class, series parallel graphs, we show that no such result holds. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

Şule Yazıcı;  This paper presents a combinatorial construction of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes from difference covering arrays. While the original construction by Gallagher was by randomly allocating bits in a sparse parity-check matrix, over the past 20 years researchers have used a variety of more structured approaches to construct these codes, with the more recent constructions of well-structured LDPC coming from balanced incomplete block designs (BIBDs) and from Latin squares over finite fields. However these constructions have suffered from the limited orders for which these designs exist. Here we present a construction of LDPC codes of length $4n^2 - 2n$ for all $n$ using the cyclic group of order $2n$. These codes achieve high information rate (greater than 0.8) for $n \geq 8$, have girth at least 6 and have minimum distance 6 for $n$ odd. ;"Combinatorics (math.CO); Information Theory (cs.IT)"

SEDFs can be used to produce optimal strong algebraic manipulation detection codes. We characterize the parameters $(v, m, k, \lambda)$ of a nontrivial SEDF that is near-complete (satisfying $v=km+1$). We construct the first known nontrivial example of a $(v, m, k, \lambda)$ SEDF having $m > 2$. The parameters of this example are $(243,11,22,20)$, giving a near-complete SEDF, and its group is $\mathbb{Z}_3^5$. We provide a comprehensive framework for the study of SEDFs using character theory and algebraic number theory, showing that the cases $m=2$ and $m>2$ are fundamentally different. We prove a range of nonexistence results, greatly narrowing the scope of possible parameters of SEDFs. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

The {\it weakly semiregular number} of a graph $G$, denoted by $wr(G)$, is the minimum number of subsets into which the edge set of $G$ can be partitioned so that the subgraph induced by each subset is a weakly semiregular graph. We present a polynomial time algorithm to determine whether the weakly semiregular number of a given tree is two. On the other hand, we show that determining whether $ wr(G) = 2 $ for a given bipartite graph $ G $ with at most three numbers in its degree set is {\bf NP}-complete. Among other results, for every tree $T$, we show that $wr(T)\leq 2\log_2 \Delta(T) + \mathcal{O}(1)$, where $\Delta(T)$ denotes the maximum degree of $T$. In the second part of the work, we consider the representation number. A graph $G$ has a {\it representation modulo $r$} if there exists an injective map $\ell: V (G) \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_r$ such that vertices $v$ and $u$ are adjacent if and only if $|\ell(u) -\ell(v)|$ is relatively prime to $r$. The {\it representation number}, denoted by $rep(G)$, is the smallest $r$ such that $G$ has a representation modulo $r$. Narayan and Urick conjectured that the determination of $rep (G)$ for an arbitrary graph $G$ is a difficult problem \cite{narayan2007representations}. In this work, we confirm this conjecture and show that if $\mathbf{NP\neq P}$, then for any $\epsilon >0$, there is no polynomial time $(1-\epsilon)\frac{n}{2}$-approximation algorithm for the computation of representation number of regular graphs with $n$ vertices. ;"Combinatorics (math.CO); Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.05961;Approximations of the domination number of a graph; Glenn G. Chappell,  John Gimbel,  Chris Hartman;"  Given a graph G, the domination number gamma(G) of G is the minimum order of a set S of vertices such that each vertex not in S is adjacent to some vertex in S. Equivalently, label the vertices from {0, 1} so that the sum over each closed neighborhood is at least one; the minimum value of the sum of all labels, with this restriction, is the domination number. The fractional domination number gamma_f(G) is defined in the same way, except that the vertex labels are chosen from [0, 1]. Given an ordering of the vertex set of G, let gamma_g(G) be the approximation of the domination number by the standard greedy algorithm. Computing the domination number is NP-complete; however, we can bound gamma by these two more easily computed parameters: gamma_f(G) <= gamma(G) <= gamma_g(G). How good are these approximations? Using techniques from the theory of hypergraphs, one can show that, for every graph G of order n, gamma_g(G) / gamma_f(G) = O(log n). On the other hand, we provide examples of graphs for which gamma / gamma_f = Theta(log n) and graphs for which gamma_g / gamma = Theta(log n). Lastly, we use our examples to compare two bounds on gamma_g. ";Combinatorics (math.CO)

Employing ideas of Bachoc, DeCorte, Oliveira and Vallentin in combination with estimating certain oscillatory integrals with polynomial phase we will show that the independence ratio of the Cayley graph of $\mathbb{K}^m$ with respect to the portion of the graph of $F$ defined by $a\leq \log |s| \leq T$ is at most $O(1/(T-a))$. From here, we conclude that if $I \subseteq \mathbb{K}^m$ has positive upper density, then the difference set $I-I$ contains vectors of the form $F(s)$ for an upbounded set of values $s \in \mathbb{K}$. We deduce that the Borel chromatic number of the Cayley graph of $\mathbb{K}^m$ with respect to the set $\{ \pm F(s): s \in \mathbb{K} \}$ is infinite, while the clique number of this Cayley graph is finite. Moreover, the infinitness of the Borel chromatic number does not hold necessarily if $f_1, \dots, f_m$ are merely real-analytic functions. ;"Combinatorics (math.CO); Number Theory (math.NT)"

Let $M_t^r$ be the $r$-graph with $t$ pairwise disjoint edges. Given an $r$-graph $F$ and a positive integer $p\geq |V(F)|$, we define the {\em extension} of $F$, denoted by $H_{p}^{F}$ as follows: Label the vertices of $F$ as $v_1,\dots,v_{|V(F)|}$. Add new vertices $v_{|V(F)|+1},\dots,v_{p}$. For each pair of vertices $v_i,v_j, 1\le i<j \le p$ not contained in an edge of $F$, we add a set $B_{ij}$ of $r-2$ new vertices and the edge $\{v_i,v_j\} \cup B_{ij}$, where the $B_{ij}$ 's are pairwise disjoint over all such pairs $\{i,j\}$.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06139;Dense $3$-uniform hypergraphs containing a large clique; Biao Wu,  Yuejian Peng;  An $r$-uniform graph $G$ is dense if and only if every proper subgraph $G'$ of $G$ satisfies $\lambda (G') < \lambda (G)$, where $\lambda (G)$ is the Lagrangian of a hypergraph $G$. In 1980's, Sidorenko showed that $\pi(F)$, the Tur\'an density of an $r$-uniform hypergraph $F$ is $r!$ multiplying the supremum of the Lagrangians of all dense $F$-hom-free $r$-uniform hypergraphs. This connection has been applied in estimating Tur\'an density of hypergraphs. When $r=2$, the result of Motzkin and Straus shows that a graph is dense if and only if it is a complete graph. However, when $r\ge 3$, it becomes much harder to estimate the Lagrangians of $r$-uniform hypergraphs and to characterize the structure of all dense $r$-uniform graphs. The main goal of this note is to give some sufficient conditions for $3$-uniform graphs with given substructures to be dense. For example, if $G$ is a $3$-graph with vertex set $[t]$ and $m$ edges containing $[t-1]^{(3)}$, then $G$ is dense if and only if $m \ge {t-1 \choose 3}+{t-2 \choose 2}+1$. We also give sufficient condition condition on the number of edges for a $3$-uniform hypergraph containing a large clique minus $1$ or $2$ edges to be dense. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

In particular, the structure of the spectrum of the class of polynomials of a fixed degree $d$ is rather well known. We consider a class $\mathcal{F}_{q,n}$ of polynomials, which we obtain by modifying linear permutations at $n$ points. The study of the spectrum of $\mathcal{F}_{q,n}$ enables us to obtain a simple description of polynomials $F \in \mathcal{F}_{q,n}$ with prescribed $V_F$, especially those avoiding a given set, like cosets of subgroups of the multiplicative group $\mathbb{F}_q^*$.

This rate of convergence allows us to show a new upper tail bound on the number of trees in $G(n,p)$. As an application, we prove the law of the iterated logarithm for the number of spanning trees in $G(n,p)$. More precisely, consider the infinite random graph $G(\mathbb{N}, p)$, with vertex set $\mathbb{N}$ where each edge appears with probability $p$, a constant. By restricting to $\{1, 2, \dotsc, n\}$, we obtain a series of nested Erd\""{o}s-R\'{e}yni random graphs $G(n,p)$. We show that $X_n$, a scaled version of the number of spanning trees, satisfies the law of the iterated logarithm. ";Combinatorics (math.CO)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06210;On the vertex degrees of the skeleton of the matching polytope of a  graph; Nair Abreu,  Liliana Costa,  Carlos Henrique do Nascimento,  Laura Patuzzi;  The convex hull of the set of the incidence vectors of the matchings of a graph G is the matching polytope of the graph, M(G). The graph whose vertices and edges are the vertices and edges of M(G) is the skeleton of the matching polytope of G, denoted G(M(G)). Since the number of vertices of G(M(G)) is huge, the structural properties of these graphs have been studied in particular classes. In this paper, for an arbitrary graph G, we obtain a formulae to compute the degree of a vertex of G(M(G)) and prove that the minimum degree of G(M(G)) is equal to the number of edges of G. Also, we identify the vertices of the skeleton with the minimum degree and characterize regular skeletons of the matching polytopes. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

When $k = n$, both of these quotients coincide with the classical coinvariant algebra attached to $G_n$. The algebraic properties of our quotients are governed by the combinatorial properties of $k$-dimensional faces in the Coxeter complex attached to $G_n$ (in the case of $R_{n,k}$) and $r$-colored ordered set partitions of $\{1, 2, \dots, n\}$ with $k$ blocks (in the case of $S_{n,k}$).

Gyárfás' complementation conjecture; Alex Scott,  Paul Seymour;  A class of graphs is $\chi$-bounded if there is a function $f$ such that $\chi(G)\le f(\omega(G))$ for every induced subgraph $G$ of every graph in the class, where $\chi,\omega$ denote the chromatic number and clique number of $G$ respectively. In 1987, Gy\'arf\'as conjectured that for every $c$, if $\mathcal{C}$ is a class of graphs such that $\chi(G)\le \omega(G)+c$ for every induced subgraph $G$ of every graph in the class, then the class of complements of members of $\mathcal{C}$ is $\chi$-bounded. We prove this conjecture. Indeed, more generally, a class of graphs is $\chi$-bounded if it has the property that no graph in the class has $c+1$ odd holes, pairwise disjoint and with no edges between them. The main tool is a lemma that if $C$ is a shortest odd hole in a graph, and $X$ is the set of vertices with at least five neighbours in $V(C)$, then there is a three-vertex set that dominates $X$. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

For paths, we prove that arithmetical structures are enumerated by the Catalan numbers, and we obtain refined enumeration results related to ballot sequences.

This is true in particular for harmonious colorings, convex colorings, mcc_t-colorings, and rainbow colorings, and many more. N. Linial (1986) showed that the chromatic polynomial $\chi(G;X)$ is #P-hard to evaluate for all but three values X=0,1,2, where evaluation is in P. This dichotomy includes evaluation at real or complex values, and has the further property that the set of points for which evaluation is in P is finite. We investigate how the complexity of evaluating univariate graph polynomials that arise from CP-colorings varies for different evaluation points. We show that for some CP-colorings (harmonious, convex) the complexity of evaluation follows a similar pattern to the chromatic polynomial. However, in other cases (proper edge colorings, mcc_t-colorings, H-free colorings) we could only obtain a dichotomy for evaluations at non-negative integer points. We also discuss some CP-colorings where we only have very partial results. ";"Combinatorics (math.CO); Computational Complexity (cs.CC)"

Let $(1, a_2, \ldots, a_d)_n$ denote the function $f_n$ of degree $d$ in $n$ variables generated by the monomial $x_1x_{a_2} \cdots x_{a_d}.$ Such a function $f_n$ is called {\em monomial rotation symmetric} (MRS). It was proved in a $2012$ paper that for any MRS $f_n$ with $d=3,$ the sequence of weights $\{w_k = wt(f_k):~k = 3, 4, \ldots\}$ satisfies a homogeneous linear recursion with integer coefficients. In this paper it is proved that such recursions exist for any rotation symmetric function $f_n;$ such a function is generated by some sum of $t$ monomials of various degrees. The last section of the paper gives a Mathematica program which explicitly computes the homogeneous linear recursion for the weights, given any rotation symmetric $f_n.$ The reader who is only interested in finding some recursions can use the program and not be concerned with the details of the rather complicated proofs in this paper.

The {\it universal labeling number} of a graph $G$ is the minimum number $k$ such that $G$ has {\it universal labeling} from $\{1,2,\ldots, k\}$ denoted it by $\overrightarrow{\chi_{u}}(G) $. We have $2\Delta(G)-2 \leq \overrightarrow{\chi_{u}} (G)\leq 2^{\Delta(G)}$, where $\Delta(G)$ denotes the maximum degree of $G$. In this work, we offer a provocative question that is:"" Is there any polynomial function $f$ such that for every graph $G$, $\overrightarrow{\chi_{u}} (G)\leq f(\Delta(G))$?"". Towards this question, we introduce some lower and upper bounds on their parameter of interest. Also, we prove that for every tree $T$, $\overrightarrow{\chi_{u}}(T)=\mathcal{O}(\Delta^3) $. Next, we show that for a given 3-regular graph $G$, the universal labeling number of $G$ is 4 if and only if $G$ belongs to Class 1. Therefore, for a given 3-regular graph $G$, it is an $ \mathbf{NP} $-complete to determine whether the universal labeling number of $G$ is 4. Finally, using probabilistic methods, we almost confirm a weaker version of the problem. ";"Combinatorics (math.CO); Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM)"

This graphon can then in turn be used to generate the so-called W-random graphs in a natural way. The aim of this paper is to compare the dense PAG model with the W-random graph model obtained from the corresponding graphon. Motivated by the multigraph limit theory, we investigate the expected jumble norm distance of the two models in terms on the number of vertices $n$. We present a coupling for which the expectation can be bounded from above by $O(\log^2 n\cdot n^{-1/3})$, and provide a universal lower bound that is coupling independent, but with a worse exponent. ;"Combinatorics (math.CO); Probability (math.PR)"

Two cubes $[0,1)^d+t$, $[0,1)^d+s$ are called a twin pair if $|t_j-s_j|=1$ for some $j\in [d]=\{1,\ldots, d\}$ and $t_i=s_i$ for every $i\in [d]\setminus \{j\}$. In $1930$, Keller conjectured that in every cube tiling of $\mathbb{R}^d$ there is a twin pair. Keller's conjecture is true for dimensions $d\leq 6$ and false for all dimensions $d\geq 8$. For $d=7$ the conjecture is still open. Let $x\in \mathbb{R}^d$, $i\in [d]$, and let $L(T,x,i)$ be the set of all $i$th coordinates $t_i$ of vectors $t\in T$ such that $([0,1)^d+t)\cap ([0,1]^d+x)\neq \emptyset$ and $t_i\leq x_i$.

Thus, if $[0,1)^7+T$ is a counterexample to Keller's conjecture, then $r^+(T)=3$, which is the last unsolved case of Keller's conjecture.

Bodnar and Rhoades (2015) confirmed their conjecture that $NC(a,b)$ is closed under rotation and proved an instance of the cyclic sieving phenomenon for this rotation action. We give a definition of $NC(a,b)$ which works for all coprime $a$ and $b$ and prove closure under rotation and cyclic sieving in this more general setting. We also generalize noncrossing parking functions to all coprime $a$ and $b$, and provide a character formula for the action of $\mathfrak{S}_a \times \mathbb{Z}_{b-1}$ on $\mathsf{Park}^{NC}(a,b)$. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

We denote $\hat{R}(G_1,\ldots,G_k)$ by $\hat{R}_{k}(G)$ when $G_1=\cdots=G_k=G$. Haxell, Kohayakawa and \L{}uczak showed that the size Ramsey number of a cycle $C_n$ is linear in $n$ i.e. $\hat{R}_{k}(C_{n})\leq c_k n$ for some constant $c_k$. Their proof, is based on the regularity lemma of Szemer\'{e}di and so no specific constant $c_k$ is known. In this paper, we give various upper bounds for the size-Ramsey numbers of cycles. We give an alternative proof of $\hat{R}_{k}(C_{n})\leq c_k n$, avoiding the use of the regularity lemma. For two colours, we show that for sufficiently large $n$ we have $\hat{R}(C_{n},C_{n}) \leq 10^6\times cn,$ where $c=843$ if $n$ is even and $c=113482$ otherwise. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

For signed graphs (which have bidirected orientations), the situation is more subtle. For a finite group $\Gamma$, let $\epsilon_2(\Gamma)$ be the largest integer $d$ so that $\Gamma$ has a subgroup isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_2^d$. We prove that for every signed graph $G$ and $d \ge 0$ there is a polynomial $f_d$ so that $f_d(n)$ is the number of nowhere-zero $\Gamma$-flows in $G$ for every abelian group $\Gamma$ with $\epsilon_2(\Gamma) = d$ and $|\Gamma| = 2^d n$.

Kopylov proved a strengthening of this result for 2-connected graphs with extremal examples $H_{n,k,t}$ and $H_{n,k,2}$. In this note, we generalize the result of Kopylov to bound the number of $s$-cliques in a graph with circumference less than $k$. Furthermore, we show that the same extremal examples that maximize the number of edges also maximize the number of cliques of any fixed size. Finally, we obtain the extremal number of $s$-cliques in a graph with no path on $k$-vertices. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

Bach, Paudyal, and Remmel introduced Fibonacci analogues of the Stirling numbers called Fibo-Stirling numbers of the first and second kind. These numbers serve as the connection coefficients between the Fibo-falling factorial basis $\{(x)_{\downarrow_{F,n}}:n \geq 0\}$ and the Fibo-rising factorial basis $\{(x)_{\uparrow_{F,n}}:n \geq 0\}$ which are defined by $(x)_{\downarrow_{F,0}} = (x)_{\uparrow_{F,0}} = 1$ and for $k \geq 1$, $(x)_{\downarrow_{F,k}} = x(x-F_1) \cdots (x-F_{k-1})$ and $(x)_{\uparrow_{F,k}} = x(x+F_1) \cdots (x+F_{k-1})$. We gave a general rook theory model which allowed us to give combinatorial interpretations of the Fibo-Stirling numbers of the first and second kind. There are two natural $q$-analogues of the falling and rising Fibo-factorial basis. That is, let $[x]_q = \frac{q^x-1}{q-1}$. Then we let $[x]_{\downarrow_{q,F,0}} = \overline{[x]}_{\downarrow_{q,F,0}} = [x]_{\uparrow_{q,F,0}} = \overline{[x]}_{\uparrow_{q,F,0}}=1$ and, for $k > 0$, we let $[x]_{\downarrow_{q,F,k}} = [x]_q [x-F_1]_q \cdots [x-F_{k-1}]_q$, $\overline{[x]}_{\downarrow_{q,F,k}}= [x]_q ([x]_q-[F_1]_q) \cdots ([x]_q-[F_{k-1}]_q)$, $[x]_{\uparrow_{q,F,k}}= [x]_q [x+F_1]_q \cdots [x+F_{k-1}]_q$, and $\overline{[x]}_{\uparrow_{q,F,k}}= [x]_q ([x]_q+[F_1]_q) \cdots ([x]_q+[F_{k-1}]_q)$. In this paper, we show we can modify the rook theory model of Bach, Paudyal, and Remmel to give combinatorial interpretations for the two different types $q$-analogues of the Fibo-Stirling numbers which arise as the connection coefficients between the two different $q$-analogues of the Fibonacci falling and rising factorial bases. \end{abstract} ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

The $i$-block-intersection graph ($i$-BIG) of $\mathcal{D}$ is the graph that has $\mathcal{B}$ as its vertex set, where two vertices $B_{1} \in \mathcal{B}$ and $B_{2} \in \mathcal{B}$ are adjacent if and only if $|B_{1} \cap B_{2}| = i$. In this paper several constructions are obtained that start with twofold triple systems (TTSs) with Hamiltonian $2$-BIGs and result in larger TTSs that also have Hamiltonian $2$-BIGs. These constructions collectively enable us to determine the complete spectrum of TTSs with Hamiltonian $2$-BIGs (equivalently TTSs with cyclic $2$-intersecting Gray codes) as well as the complete spectrum for TTSs with $2$-BIGs that have Hamilton paths (i.e., for TTSs with $2$-intersecting Gray codes). In order to prove these spectrum results, we sometimes require ingredient TTSs that have large partial parallel classes; we prove lower bounds on the sizes of partial parallel clasess in arbitrary TTSs, and then construct larger TTSs with both cyclic $2$-intersecting Gray codes and parallel classes.

Kang,  François Pirot;  We consider distance colourings in graphs of maximum degree at most $d$ and how excluding one fixed cycle length $\ell$ affects the number of colours required as $d\to\infty$. For vertex-colouring and $t\ge 1$, if any two distinct vertices connected by a path of at most $t$ edges are required to be coloured differently, then a reduction by a logarithmic (in $d$) factor against the trivial bound $O(d^t)$ can be obtained by excluding an odd cycle length $\ell \ge 3t$ if $t$ is odd or by excluding an even cycle length $\ell \ge 2t+2$. For edge-colouring and $t\ge 2$, if any two distinct edges connected by a path of fewer than $t$ edges are required to be coloured differently, then excluding an even cycle length $\ell \ge 2t$ is sufficient for a logarithmic factor reduction. For $t\ge 2$, neither of the above statements are possible for other parity combinations of $\ell$ and $t$. These results can be considered extensions of results due to Johansson (1996) and Mahdian (2000), and are related to open problems of Alon and Mohar (2002) and Kaiser and Kang (2014). ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

We prove that if $k \ge 3$ and $s \ge 2k^2$, then every $k$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices with minimum codegree at least $(1/2 + o(1))n$ has the property that every vertex is covered by a copy of $C^k_s$. Our result is asymptotically best possible for infinitely many pairs of $s$ and $k$, e.g. when $s$ and $k$ are coprime. A perfect $C^k_s$-tiling is a spanning collection of vertex-disjoint copies of $C^k_s$. When $s$ is divisible by $k$, the problem of determining the minimum codegree that guarantees a perfect $C^k_s$-tiling was solved by a result of Mycroft.

In proving this conjecture, Alexeev and Tsimerman, and independently Golowich, found that some equations in n variables have degree of regularity n-1 for any value of n. Their work left many questions as to how and which other properties of equations are closely tied to the degree of regularity, and if there is a simpler or more effective way of thinking about it. In this paper, we answer some of these questions, prove that various families of linear homogeneous equations in n variables have degree of regularity n-1, and establish some conditions under which this property holds. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08292;Kneser ranks of random graphs and minimum difference representations; Zoltán Füredi,  Ida Kantor;  Every graph $G=(V,E)$ is an induced subgraph of some Kneser graph of rank $k$, i.e., there is an assignment of (distinct) $k$-sets $v \mapsto A_v$ to the vertices $v\in V$ such that $A_u$ and $A_v$ are disjoint if and only if $uv\in E$. The smallest such $k$ is called the Kneser rank of $G$ and denoted by $f_{\rm Kneser}(G)$. As an application of a result of Frieze and Reed concerning the clique cover number of random graphs we show that for constant $0< p< 1$ there exist constants $c_i=c_i(p)>0$, $i=1,2$ such that with high probability \[ c_1 n/(\log n)< f_{\rm Kneser}(G) < c_2 n/(\log n). \] We apply this for other graph representations defined by Boros, Gurvich and Meshulam. A {\em $k$-min-difference representation} of a graph $G$ is an assignment of a set $A_i$ to each vertex $i\in V(G)$ such that \[ ij\in E(G) \,\, \Leftrightarrow \, \, \min \{|A_i\setminus A_j|,|A_j\setminus A_i| \}\geq k. \] The smallest $k$ such that there exists a $k$-min-difference representation of $G$ is denoted by $f_{\min}(G)$. Balogh and Prince proved in 2009 that for every $k$ there is a graph $G$ with $f_{\min}(G)\geq k$. We prove that there are constants $c''_1, c''_2>0$ such that $c''_1 n/(\log n)< f_{\min}(G) < c''_2n/(\log n)$ holds for almost all bipartite graphs $G$ on $n+n$ vertices. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

We introduce a symmetric relationship of friendship between block designs built on a set $V$ and consider families of block designs where all designs are friends of each other, the so-called friendly families. We show that a friendly family admits a partial ordering. Furthermore, we exhibit a map from the power set of $V$, partially ordered by inclusion, to a friendly family of a particular type which preserves the partial order. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08355;Equal relation between the extra connectivity and pessimistic  diagnosability for some regular graphs; Mei-Mei Gu,  Rong-Xia Hao,  Jun-Ming Xu,  Yan-Quan Feng;  Extra connectivity and the pessimistic diagnosis are two crucial subjects for a multiprocessor system's ability to tolerate and diagnose faulty processor. The pessimistic diagnosis strategy is a classic strategy based on the PMC model in which isolates all faulty vertices within a set containing at most one fault-free vertex. In this paper, the result that the pessimistic diagnosability $t_p(G)$ equals the extra connectivity $\kappa_{1}(G)$ of a regular graph $G$ under some conditions are shown. Furthermore, the following new results are gotten: the pessimistic diagnosability $t_p(S_n^2)=4n-9$ for split-star networks $S_n^2$, $t_p(\Gamma_n)=2n-4$ for Cayley graphs generated by transposition trees $\Gamma_n$, $t_p(\Gamma_{n}(\Delta))=4n-11$ for Cayley graph generated by the $2$-tree $\Gamma_{n}(\Delta)$, $t_{p}(BP_n)=2n-2$ for the burnt pancake networks $BP_n$. As corollaries, the known results about the extra connectivity and the pessimistic diagnosability of many famous networks including the alternating group graphs, the alternating group networks, BC networks, the $k$-ary $n$-cube networks etc. are obtained directly. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

The nilradical graph and non-nilradical graph of Z_n are denoted by N(Z_n) and Omega(Z_n) respectively. In 2012, Haynes et al. [5] introduced the concept of very cost effective graph. For a graph G = (V,E) and a set of vertices S subset of V, a vertex v in S is said to be very cost effective if it is adjacent to more vertices in V\S than in S. A bipartition Pi = {S, V\S} is called very cost effective if both S and V\S are very cost effective sets [5,6]. In this paper, we investigate the very cost effective bipartition of Gamma(Z_n), where n = p_1 p_2 ... p_m, here all p_i's are distinct primes. In addition, we discuss the cases in which N(Z_n) and Omega(Z_n) graphs have very cost effective bipartition for different n. Finally, we derive some results for very cost effective bipartition of the Line graph and Total graph of Gamma(Z_n), denoted by L(Gamma(Z_n)) and T(Gamma(Z_n)) respectively. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08386;The relationship between $k$-forcing and $k$-power domination; Daniela Ferrero,  Leslie Hogben,  Franklin H.J. Kenter,  Michael Young;  Zero forcing and power domination are iterative processes on graphs where an initial set of vertices are observed, and additional vertices become observed based on some rules. In both cases, the goal is to eventually observe the entire graph using the fewest number of initial vertices. Chang et al. introduced $k$-power domination in [Generalized power domination in graphs, {\it Discrete Applied Math.} 160 (2012) 1691-1698] as a generalization of power domination and standard graph domination. Independently, Amos et al. defined $k$-forcing in [Upper bounds on the $k$-forcing number of a graph, {\it Discrete Applied Math.} 181 (2015) 1-10] to generalize zero forcing. In this paper, we combine the study of $k$-forcing and $k$-power domination, providing a new approach to analyze both processes. We give a relationship between the $k$-forcing and the $k$-power domination numbers of a graph that bounds one in terms of the other. We also obtain results using the contraction of subgraphs that allow the parallel computation of $k$-forcing and $k$-power dominating sets. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

In our work, we explore the multiplicative Zagreb indices of bipartite graphs of order $n$ with diameter $d$, and sharp upper bounds are obtained for these indices of graphs in $\mathcal{B}(n,d)$, where $\mathcal{B}(n, d)$ is the set of all $n$-vertex bipartite graphs with the diameter $d$.

In particular, it establishes a connection between exponential sums of these perturbations and Diophantine equations of the form $$ \sum_{l=0}^n \binom{n}{l} x_l=0,$$ where $x_j$ belongs to some fixed bounded subset $\Gamma$ of $\mathbb{Z}$. The concepts of trivially balanced symmetric Boolean function and sporadic balanced Boolean function are extended to this type of perturbations. An observation made by Canteaut and Videau for symmetric Boolean functions of fixed degree is extended. To be specific, it is proved that, excluding the trivial cases, balanced perturbations of fixed degree do not exist when the number of variables grows. Some sporadic balanced perturbations are presented. Finally, a beautiful but unexpected identity between perturbations of two very different symmetric Boolean functions is also included in this work. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

Although it is known that every connected $2k$-valent infinite circulant graph has a two-way-infinite Hamilton path, there exist many such graphs that do not have a decomposition into $k$ edge-disjoint two-way-infinite Hamilton paths. This contrasts with the finite case where it is conjectured that every $2k$-valent connected circulant graph has a decomposition into $k$ edge-disjoint Hamilton cycles. We settle the problem of decomposing $2k$-valent infinite circulant graphs into $k$ edge-disjoint two-way-infinite Hamilton paths for $k=2$, in many cases when $k=3$, and in many other cases including where the connection set is $\pm\{1,2,\ldots,k\}$ or $\pm\{1,2,\ldots,k-1,k+1\}$. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

We use locating-dominating sets and identifying codes, which are closely related concepts for this purpose. These sets consist of a dominating set of graph such that every vertex is uniquely identified by its neighborhood within the dominating sets.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08564;On sequences of polynomials arising from graph invariants; T. Kotek,  J.A. Makowsky,  E.V. Ravve;  Graph polynomials are deemed useful if they give rise to algebraic characterizations of various graph properties, and their evaluations encode many other graph invariants. Algebraic: The complete graphs $K_n$ and the complete bipartite graphs $K_{n,n}$ can be characterized as those graphs whose matching polynomials satisfy a certain recurrence relations and are related to the Hermite and Laguerre polynomials. An encoded graph invariant: The absolute value of the chromatic polynomial $\chi(G,X)$ of a graph $G$ evaluated at $-1$ counts the number of acyclic orientations of $G$. In this paper we prove a general theorem on graph families which are characterized by families of polynomials satisfying linear recurrence relations. This gives infinitely many instances similar to the characterization of $K_{n,n}$. We also show where to use, instead of the Hermite and Laguerre polynomials, linear recurrence relations where the coefficients do not depend on $n$. Finally, we discuss the distinctive power of graph polynomials in specific form. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

Zamaraev;  The celebrated theorem of Robertson and Seymour states that in the family of minor-closed graph classes, there is a unique minimal class of graphs of unbounded tree-width, namely, the class of planar graphs. In the case of tree-width, the restriction to minor-closed classes is justified by the fact that the tree-width of a graph is never smaller than the tree-width of any of its minors. This, however, is not the case with respect to clique-width, as the clique-width of a graph can be (much) smaller than the clique-width of its minor. On the other hand, the clique-width of a graph is never smaller than the clique-width of any of its induced subgraphs, which allows us to be restricted to hereditary classes (that is, classes closed under taking induced subgraphs), when we study clique-width. Up to date, only finitely many minimal hereditary classes of graphs of unbounded clique-width have been discovered in the literature. In the present paper, we prove that the family of such classes is infinite. Moreover, we show that the same is true with respect to linear clique-width. ;"Combinatorics (math.CO); Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08982;Leaf-reconstructibility of phylogenetic networks; Leo van Iersel,  Vincent Moulton;  An important problem in evolutionary biology is to reconstruct the evolutionary history of a set $X$ of species. This history is often represented as a phylogenetic network, that is, a connected graph with leaves labelled by elements in $X$ (for example, an evolutionary tree), which is usually also binary, i.e. all vertices have degree 1 or 3. A common approach used in phylogenetics to build a phylogenetic network on $X$ involves constructing it from networks on subsets of $X$. Here we consider the question of which (unrooted) phylogenetic networks are leaf-reconstructible, i.e. which networks can be uniquely reconstructed from the set of networks obtained from it by deleting a single leaf (its $X$-deck). This problem is closely related to the (in)famous reconstruction conjecture in graph theory but, as we shall show, presents distinct challenges. We show that some large classes of phylogenetic networks are reconstructible from their $X$-deck. This includes phylogenetic trees, binary networks containing at least one non-trivial cut-edge, and binary level-4 networks (the level of a network measures how far it is from being a tree). We also show that for fixed $k$, almost all binary level-$k$ phylogenetic networks are leaf-reconstructible. As an application of our results, we show that a level-3 network $N$ can be reconstructed from its quarnets, that is, 4-leaved networks that are induced by $N$ in a certain recursive fashion. Our results lead to several interesting open problems which we discuss, including the conjecture that all phylogenetic networks with at least five leaves are leaf-reconstructible. ;"Combinatorics (math.CO); Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)"

Given permutations x and y of E that together generate a transitive subgroup, for which s is it true that x and the conjugate of y by s also generate a transitive subgroup? Such transitive permutation pairs encode dessins d'enfants, important graph-theoretic objects which are also known to have great arithmetic significance. The absolute Galois group acts on dessins d'enfants and permutes them in a very mysterious way. Two dessins d'enfants that share certain elementary combinatorial features are related by conjugations as above, and dessins d'enfants in the same Galois-orbit share these features and more, so it seems worthwhile to have a good answer to the above question. I classify, relative to x and y, exactly those transpositions s for which the new pair is guaranteed to be transitive. I also provide examples of the ""exceptional"" s which show the range of possible behavior and prove that the above question for the exceptional cases is equivalent to a natural question about deletion in graphs that may have a good answer in this more structured world of topological graphs. Finally, I classify transpositions s according to how they change the genus of the surface underlying the dessin d'enfant of x, y. Some of the tools, like the Reroute Operation/Theorem, may have use beyond Dessins d'Enfants. ";"Combinatorics (math.CO); Number Theory (math.NT)"

Martins,  Daniel Panario,  Claudio Qureshi,  Eric Schmutz;  We consider random mappings on n = kr nodes with preimage sizes restricted to a set of the form {0,k}, where k = k(r) is greater than 1. We prove that T, the least common multiple of the cycle lengths, and B= the product of the cycle lengths, are both asymptotically lognormal. The expected values of these random variables are also also estimated and compared with numerical results. This work is motivated, in part, by the use of these mappings as heuristic models for polynomials of the form x^k + a over the integers modulo p with p congruent to 1 mod k. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.0234;List colorings with distinct list sizes, the case of complete bipartite  graphs; Zoltán Füredi,  Ida Kantor;  Let $f:V \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ be a function on the vertex set of the graph $G=(V,E)$. The graph $G$ is {\em $f$-choosable} if for every collection of lists with list sizes specified by $f$ there is a proper coloring using colors from the lists. The sum choice number, $\chi_{sc}(G)$, is the minimum of $\sum f(v)$, over all functions $f$ such that $G$ is $f$-choosable. It is known (Alon 1993, 2000) that if $G$ has average degree $d$, then the usual choice number $\chi_\ell(G)$ is at least $\Omega(\log d)$, so they grow simultaneously. In this paper we show that $\chi_{sc}(G)/|V(G)|$ can be bounded while the minimum degree $\delta_{\min}(G)\rightarrow \infty$. Our main tool is to give tight estimates for the sum choice number of the unbalanced complete bipartite graph $K_{a,q}$. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

The idea is to introduce two kinds of transformations on posets and compute $f_P(\x)$ by recursively applying these transformations. As an application, we consider the partially ordinal sum $P_n$ of $n$ copies of a given poset, which generalizes both the direct sum and the ordinal sum. We show that the sequence $\{f_{P_n}(\x)\}_{n\ge 1}$ satisfies a finite system of recurrence relations with respect to $n$. We illustrate the method by several examples, including a kind of 3-rowed posets and the multi-cube posets. ;"Combinatorics (math.CO); Number Theory (math.NT)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.0253;Nearly Complete Graphs Decomposable into Large Induced Matchings and  their Applications; Noga Alon,  Ankur Moitra,  Benny Sudakov;  We describe two constructions of (very) dense graphs which are edge disjoint unions of large {\em induced} matchings. The first construction exhibits graphs on $N$ vertices with ${N \choose 2}-o(N^2)$ edges, which can be decomposed into pairwise disjoint induced matchings, each of size $N^{1-o(1)}$. The second construction provides a covering of all edges of the complete graph $K_N$ by two graphs, each being the edge disjoint union of at most $N^{2-\delta}$ induced matchings, where $\delta > 0.058$. This disproves (in a strong form) a conjecture of Meshulam, substantially improves a result of Birk, Linial and Meshulam on communicating over a shared channel, and (slightly) extends the analysis of H{\aa}stad and Wigderson of the graph test of Samorodnitsky and Trevisan for linearity. Additionally, our constructions settle a combinatorial question of Vempala regarding a candidate rounding scheme for the directed Steiner tree problem. ;"Combinatorics (math.CO); Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS); Information Theory (cs.IT)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.0284;A topological interpretation of the walk distances; Pavel Chebotarev,  Michel Deza;  The walk distances in graphs have no direct interpretation in terms of walk weights, since they are introduced via the \emph{logarithms} of walk weights. Only in the limiting cases where the logarithms vanish such representations follow straightforwardly. The interpretation proposed in this paper rests on the identity $\ln\det B=\tr\ln B$ applied to the cofactors of the matrix $I-tA,$ where $A$ is the weighted adjacency matrix of a weighted multigraph and $t$ is a sufficiently small positive parameter. In addition, this interpretation is based on the power series expansion of the logarithm of a matrix. Kasteleyn (1967) was probably the first to apply the foregoing approach to expanding the determinant of $I-A$. We show that using a certain linear transformation the same approach can be extended to the cofactors of $I-tA,$ which provides a topological interpretation of the walk distances. ;"Combinatorics (math.CO); Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM); Social and Information Networks (cs.SI); Metric Geometry (math.MG)"

In this article, we show that $m \times n$ binary 2-covering arrays under some constraints on $m$ and $n$ come from the maximal covering arrays.

We introduce a superclass of the finitary matroids, the nearly finitary matroids, and prove that the union of two nearly finitary matroids is a nearly finitary matroid. On the other hand, we prove that the union of two arbitrary infinite matroids is not necessarily a matroid. Indeed, we show (under a weak additional assumption) that the nearly finitary matroids are essentially the largest class of matroids for which one can have a union theorem. We then extend the base packing theorem for finite matroids to finite families of co-finitary matroids. This, in turn, yields a matroidal proof for the tree-packing results for infinite graphs due to Diestel and Tutte. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.1459;On the Classification of Universal Rotor-Routers; Xiaoyu He;  The combinatorial theory of rotor-routers has connections with problems of statistical mechanics, graph theory, chaos theory, and computer science. A rotor-router network defines a deterministic walk on a digraph G in which a particle walks from a source vertex until it reaches one of several target vertices. Motivated by recent results due to Giacaglia et al., we study rotor-router networks in which all non-target vertices have the same type. A rotor type r is universal if every hitting sequence can be achieved by a homogeneous rotor-router network consisting entirely of rotors of type r. We give a conjecture that completely classifies universal rotor types. Then, this problem is simplified by a theorem we call the Reduction Theorem that allows us to consider only two-state rotors. A rotor-router network called the compressor, because it tends to shorten rotor periods, is introduced along with an associated algorithm that determines the universality of almost all rotors. New rotor classes, including boppy rotors, balanced rotors, and BURD rotors, are defined to study this algorithm rigorously. Using the compressor the universality of new rotor classes is proved, and empirical computer results are presented to support our conclusions. Prior to these results, less than 100 of the roughly 260,000 possible two-state rotor types of length up to 17 were known to be universal, while the compressor algorithm proves the universality of all but 272 of these rotor types. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

The first proof relies on two formulas with two parameters that are related to the four-parameter formulas of Boulet. We also give a combinatorial proof of this result by using Sylvester's bijection, which implies a stronger partition theorem. For m=0, our result reduces to Bessenrodt's refinement of Euler's Theorem. If the alternating sum and the number of odd parts are not taken into account, we are led to a connection to a generalization of Euler's theorem, which can be deduced from a theorem of Andrews on equivalent upper bound sequences of multiplicities. Analogously, we show that the number of partitions of n with alternating sum k such that the multiplicity of each even part is bounded by 2m+1 equals the number of partitions of n with k odd parts such that the multiplicity of each even part is also bounded by 2m+1.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.2064;Tropical decomposition of Young's partition lattice; Vivek Dhand;"  Young's partition lattice $L(m,n)$ consists of unordered partitions having $m$ parts where each part is at most $n$. Using methods from complex algebraic geometry, R. Stanley proved that $L(m,n)$ is rank-symmetric, unimodal, and strongly Sperner. Moreover, he conjectured that $L(m,n)$ has a stronger property called symmetric chain decomposition. Despite many efforts, this conjecture has only been proved for $\min(m,n)\leq 4$. In this paper, we decompose $L(m,n)$ into level sets for certain tropical polynomials derived from the secant varieties of the rational normal curve in projective space, and we find that the resulting subposets have an elementary raising and lowering algorithm. As a corollary, we obtain a symmetric chain decomposition for the subposet of $L(m,n)$ consisting of ""sufficiently generic"" partitions.

The concept of identifying codes was introduced in 1998 by Karpovsky, Chakrabarty and Levitin. Identifying codes have been studied in various grids. In particular, it has been shown that there exists a $(1,\leq 2)$-identifying code in the king grid with density 3/7 and that there are no such identifying codes with density smaller than 5/12. Using a suitable frame and a discharging procedure, we improve the lower bound by showing that any $(1,\leq 2)$-identifying code of the king grid has density at least 47/111. ;"Combinatorics (math.CO); Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.2652;Combinatorial frameworks for cluster algebras; Nathan Reading,  David E Speyer;  We develop a general approach to finding combinatorial models for cluster algebras. The approach is to construct a labeled graph called a framework. When a framework is constructed with certain properties, the result is a model incorporating information about exchange matrices, principal coefficients, g-vectors, and g-vector fans. The idea behind frameworks arises from Cambrian combinatorics and sortable elements, and in this paper, we use sortable elements to construct a framework for any cluster algebra with an acyclic initial exchange matrix. This Cambrian framework yields a model of the entire exchange graph when the cluster algebra is of finite type. Outside of finite type, the Cambrian framework models only part of the exchange graph. In a forthcoming paper, we extend the Cambrian construction to produce a complete framework for a cluster algebra whose associated Cartan matrix is of affine type. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

The evaluation of this polynomial at weakly decreasing sequences k1 >= k2 >= ... >= kn turns out to be interpretable as signed enumeration of new combinatorial objects called Decreasing Monotone Triangles. There exist surprising connections between the two classes of objects -- in particular it is shown that alpha(n; 1,2,...,n) = alpha(2n; n,n,n-1,n-1,...,1,1). In perfect analogy to the correspondence between Monotone Triangles and Alternating Sign Matrices, the set of Decreasing Monotone Triangles with bottom row (n,n,n-1,n-1,...,1,1) is in one-to-one correspondence with a certain set of ASM-like matrices, which also play an important role in proving the claimed identity algebraically.

Traditional approaches suffer from the ambiguities of arbitrary permutations and scaling in each frequency bin of the estimated filters and/or the sources, and they are usually corrected by taking into account some special properties of the filters/sources. This paper focusses on the filter permutation problem in the absence of scaling, investigating the possible use of the temporal sparsity of the filters as a property enabling permutation correction. Theoretical and experimental results highlight the potential as well as the limits of sparsity as an hypothesis to obtain a well-posed permutation problem. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.2897;The Laplacian eigenvalues of graphs: a survey; Xiao-Dong Zhang;  The Laplacian matrix of a simple graph is the difference of the diagonal matrix of vertex degree and the (0,1) adjacency matrix.

This paper is primarily a survey of various aspects of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of a graph for the past teens. In addition, some new unpublished results and questions are concluded. Emphasis is given on classifications of the upper and lower bounds for the Laplacian eigenvalues of graphs (including some special graphs, such as trees, bipartite graphs, triangular-free graphs, cubic graphs, etc.) as a function of other graph invariants, such as degree sequence, the average 2-degree, diameter, the maximal independence number, the maximal matching number, vertex connectivity, the domination number, the number of the spanning trees, etc. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.2947;Tight bounds on the threshold for permuted k-colorability; Varsha Dani,  Cristopher Moore,  Anna Olson;  If each edge (u,v) of a graph G=(V,E) is decorated with a permutation pi_{u,v} of k objects, we say that it has a permuted k-coloring if there is a coloring sigma from V to {1,...,k} such that sigma(v) is different from pi_{u,v}(sigma(u)) for all (u,v) in E. Based on arguments from statistical physics, we conjecture that the threshold d_k for permuted k-colorability in random graphs G(n,m=dn/2), where the permutations on the edges are uniformly random, is equal to the threshold for standard graph k-colorability. The additional symmetry provided by random permutations makes it easier to prove bounds on d_k. By applying the second moment method with these additional symmetries, and applying the first moment method to a random variable that depends on the number of available colors at each vertex, we bound the threshold within an additive constant. Specifically, we show that for any constant epsilon > 0, for sufficiently large k we have 2 k ln k - ln k - 2 - epsilon < d_k < 2 k ln k - ln k - 1 + epsilon. In contrast, the best known bounds on d_k for standard k-colorability leave an additive gap of about ln k between the upper and lower bounds. ;"Combinatorics (math.CO); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Computational Complexity (cs.CC); Probability (math.PR)"

Any such scheme is an algebraic equivalent of a $(k,l)$-semi-regular bipartite voltage graph with $n$ and $m$ vertices in the bipartition sets and voltages coming from the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_\mu$. We are interested in the subclass of $\mathbb{Z}_\mu$--schemes that are characterized by the property $a - b + c - d\; \not \equiv \;0$ (mod $\mu$) for all $a \in S_{ij}$, $b \in S_{ih}$, $c \in S_{gh}$, and $d \in S_{gj}$ where $i,g \in {1,...,m}$ and $j,h \in {1,...,n}$ need not be distinct.

In this paper, we look at the dual question of covering all edges of a graph by Hamilton cycles and prove that if a graph with maximum degree $\Delta$ satisfies some basic expansion properties and contains a family of $(1-o(1))\Delta/2$ edge disjoint Hamilton cycles, then there also exists a covering of its edges by $(1+o(1))\Delta/2$ Hamilton cycles. This implies that for every $\alpha >0$ and every $p \geq n^{\alpha-1}$ there exists a covering of all edges of $G(n,p)$ by $(1+o(1))np/2$ Hamilton cycles asymptotically almost surely, which is nearly optimal. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

We consider the corresponding problem for unrooted trees. More precisely, given a tree $T$ with leaf set $X$ and a proper vertex colouring of its interior vertices, we can map every triple of three different leaves to the colour of its median vertex. We characterise all ternary maps that can be obtained in this way in terms of 4- and 5-point conditions, and we show that the corresponding tree and its colouring can be reconstructed from a ternary map that satisfies those conditions. Further, we give an additional condition that characterises whether the tree is binary, and we describe an algorithm that reconstructs general trees in a bottom-up fashion. ";Combinatorics (math.CO)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.00217;Operads of decorated cliques; Samuele Giraudo;  The vector space of all polygons with configurations of diagonals is endowed with an operad structure. This is the consequence of a functorial construction $\mathsf{C}$ introduced here, which takes unitary magmas $\mathcal{M}$ as input and produces operads. The obtained operads involve regular polygons with configurations of arcs labeled on $\mathcal{M}$, called $\mathcal{M}$-decorated cliques and generalizing usual polygons with configurations of diagonals. We provide here a complete study of the operads $\mathsf{C}\mathcal{M}$. By considering combinatorial subfamilies of $\mathcal{M}$-decorated cliques defined, for instance, by limiting the maximal number of crossing diagonals or the maximal degree of the vertices, we obtain suboperads and quotients of $\mathsf{C}\mathcal{M}$. This leads to a new hierarchy of operads containing, among others, operads on noncrossing configurations, Motzkin configurations, forests, dissections of polygons, and involutions. We show that the suboperad of noncrossing configurations is Koszul and exhibit its presentation by generators and relations. Besides, the construction $\mathsf{C}$ leads to alternative definitions of several operads, like the operad of bicolored noncrossing configurations and the operads of simple and double multi-tildes. ;"Combinatorics (math.CO); Quantum Algebra (math.QA)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.00284;Musical intervals under 12-note equal temperament: a geometrical  interpretation; R. Caimmi,  A. Franzon,  S. Tognon;  Musical intervals in multiple of semitones under 12-note equal temperament, or more specifically pitch-class subsets of assigned cardinality ($n$-chords) are conceived as positive integer points within an Euclidean $n$-space. The number of distinct $n$-chords is inferred from combinatorics with the extension to $n=0$, involving an Euclidean 0-space. The number of repeating $n$-chords, or points which are turned into themselves during a circular permutation, $T_n$, of their coordinates, is inferred from algebraic considerations. Finally, the total number of $n$-chords and the number of $T_n$ set classes are determined. Palindrome and pseudo palindrome $n$-chords are defined and included among repeating $n$-chords, with regard to an equivalence relation, $T_n/T_nI$, where reflection is added to circular permutation. To this respect, the number of $T_n$ set classes is inferred concerning palindrome and pseudo palindrome $n$-chords and the remaining $n$-chords. The above results are reproduced within the framework of a geometrical interpretation, where positive integer points related to $n$-chords of cardinality, $n$, belong to a regular inclined $n$-hedron, $\Psi_{12}^n$, the vertexes lying on the coordinate axes of a Cartesian orthogonal reference frame at a distance, $x_i=12$, $1\le i\le n$, from the origin. Considering $\Psi_{12}^n$ as special cases of lattice polytopes, the number of related nonnegative integer points is also determined for completeness. A comparison is performed with the results inferred from group theory. ;"Combinatorics (math.CO); History and Overview (math.HO)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.00385;Braid group symmetries of Grassmannian cluster algebras; Chris Fraser;  We define an action of the k-strand braid group on the set of cluster variables for the Grassmannian Gr(k,n), whenever k divides n. The action sends clusters to clusters, preserving the underlying quivers, defining a homomorphism from the braid group to the cluster modular group for Gr(k,n). The action is induced by certain rational maps on Gr(k,n). Each of these maps is a quasi-automorphism of the cluster structure, a notion we defined in previous work. We also describe a quasi-isomorphism between Gr(k,n) and a certain Fock-Goncharov space of SL_k-local systems in a disk. The quasi-isomorphism identifies the cluster variables, clusters, and cluster modular groups, in these two cluster structures. Fomin and Pylyavskyy have proposed a description of the cluster combinatorics for Gr(3,n) in terms of Kuperberg's basis of non-elliptic webs. As our main application, we prove these conjectures for Gr(3,9) and describe the cluster modular group. We describe similar results for Gr(4,8). The proof relies on the fact that both of these Grassmannians are of finite mutation type. ;"Combinatorics (math.CO); Group Theory (math.GR); Representation Theory (math.RT)"

Throughout this text we illustrate the assembly of the Kontsevich $\star$-product up to order 4 in the deformation parameter $\hbar$. Already at this stage, the $\star$-product involves hundreds of graphs; expressing all their coefficients via 149 weights of basic graphs (of which 67 weights are now known exactly), we express the remaining 82 weights in terms of only 10 parameters (more specifically, in terms of only 6 parameters modulo gauge-equivalence). Finally, we outline a scheme for computer-assisted proof of the associativity, modulo $\bar{o}(\hbar^4)$, for the newly built $\star$-product expansion.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.00796;Extensions and Applications of Equitable Decompositions for Graphs with  Symmetries; Amanda Francis,  Dallas Smith,  Derek Sorenson,  Ben Webb;  We extend the theory of equitable decompositions, in which, if a graph has a particular type of symmetry, i.e. a uniform or basic automorphism $\phi$, it is possible to use $\phi$ to decompose a matrix $M$ appropriately associated with the graph. The result is a number of strictly smaller matrices whose collective eigenvalues are the same as the eigenvalues of the original matrix $M$. We show here that a large class of automorphisms, which we refer to as \emph{separable}, can be realized as a sequence of basic automorphisms, allowing us to equitably decompose $M$ over any such automorphism. We also show that not only can a matrix $M$ be decomposed but that the eigenvectors of $M$ can also be equitably decomposed. Additionally, we prove under mild conditions that if a matrix $M$ is equitably decomposed the resulting divisor matrix, which is the divisor matrix of the associated equitable partition, will have the same spectral radius as the original matrix $M$. Last, we describe how an equitable decomposition effects the Gershgorin region $\Gamma(M)$ of a matrix $M$, which can be used to localize the eigenvalues of $M$. We show that the Gershgorin region of an equitable decomposition of $M$ is contained in the Gershgorin region $\Gamma(M)$ of the original matrix. We demonstrate on a real-world network that by a sequence of equitable decompositions it is possible to significantly reduce the size of a matrix' Gershgorin region. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

We obtain the bound $$ | \{ (A_1,A_2,A) \in X \times X \times X: A = A_1 \uplus A_2 \} | \leq |X|^{3/p} $$ where $|X|$ denotes the cardinality of $X$, and $p := \log_3 \frac{27}{4} = 1.73814\dots$, so that $\frac{3}{p} = 1.72598\dots$. Furthermore, the exponent $p$ cannot be replaced by any larger quantity. This improves upon the trivial bound of $|X|^2$. The argument relies on establishing a one-dimensional convolution inequality that can be established by elementary calculus combined with some numerical verification. In a similar vein, we show that for any subset $A$ of a discrete cube $\{0,1\}^n$, the additive energy of $A$ (the number of quadruples $(a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4)$ in $A^4$ with $a_1+a_2=a_3+a_4$) is at most $|A|^{\log_2 6}$, and that this exponent is best possible.

In this note, however, we show that this last upper bound is sharp by constructing, for every integer $n \geq 2$, a regular graph $G$ with $\chi(G) = n$ but $\chi_2(G) = 2n$.

Shkredov;"  We prove a range of new sum-product type growth estimates over a general field $\mathbb{F}$, in particular the special case $\mathbb{F}=\mathbb{F}_p$. They are unified by the theme of ""breaking the $3/2$ threshold"", epitomising the previous state of the art. These estimates stem from specially suited applications of incidence bounds over $\mathbb{F}$, which apply to higher moments of representation functions. We establish the estimate $|R[A]| \gtrsim |A|^{8/5}$ for cardinality of the set $R[A]$ of distinct cross-ratios defined by triples of elements of a (sufficiently small if $\mathbb{F}$ has positive characteristic, similarly for the rest of the estimates) set $A\subset \mathbb{F}$, pinned at infinity. The cross-ratio naturally arises in various sum-product type questions of projective nature and is the unifying concept underlying most of our results. It enables one to take advantage of its symmetry properties as an onset of growth of, for instance, products of difference sets. The geometric nature of the cross-ratio enables us to break the version of the above threshold for the minimum number of distinct triangle areas $Ouu'$, defined by points $u,u'$ of a non-collinear point set $P\subset \mathbb{F}^2$. Another instance of breaking the threshold is showing that if $A$ is sufficiently small and has additive doubling constant $M$, then $|AA|\gtrsim M^{-2}|A|^{14/9}$. This result has a second moment version, which allows for new upper bounds for the number of collinear point triples in the set $A\times A\subset \mathbb{F}^2$, the quantity often arising in applications of geometric incidence estimates.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01299;On a question of Erdos and Faudree on the size Ramsey numbers; Ramin Javadi,  Gholamreza Omidi;  For given simple graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$, the size Ramsey number $\hat{R}(G_1,G_2)$ is the smallest positive integer $m$, where there exists a graph $G$ with $m$ edges such that in any edge coloring of $G$ with two colors red and blue, there is either a red copy of $G_1$ or a blue copy of $G_2$. In 1981, Erd\H{o}s and Faudree investigated the size Ramsey number $\hat{R}(K_n,tK_2)$, where $K_n$ is a complete graph on $n$ vertices and $tK_2$ is a matching of size $t$. They obtained the value of $\hat{R}(K_n,tK_2)$ when $n\geq 4t-1$ as well as for $t=2$ and asked for the behavior of these numbers when $ t $ is much larger than $ n $. In this regard, they posed the following interesting question: For every positive integer $n$, is it true that $$\lim_{t\to \infty} \frac{\hat{R}(K_n,tK_2)} {t\, \hat{R}(K_n,K_2)} = \min\left\{\dfrac{\binom{n+2t-2}{2}} {t\binom{n}{2}}\mid t\in \mathbb{N}\right\} ? $$ In this paper, we obtain the exact value of $ \hat{R}(K_n,tK_2) $ for every positive integers $ n,t $ and as a byproduct, we give an affirmative answer to the question of Erd\H{o}s and Faudree. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

Fischer and Matou\u{s}ek asked for the maximum number of triangles in such a graph.

Using affine planes defined by specific planar polynomials over finite fields, we improve the lower bound to $(1 - o(1)) k^{5/3}$. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01358;Promotion of increasing tableaux: frames and homomesies; Oliver Pechenik;"  A key fact about M.-P. Sch\""{u}tzenberger's (1972) promotion operator on rectangular standard Young tableaux is that iterating promotion once per entry recovers the original tableau. For tableaux with strictly increasing rows and columns, H. Thomas and A. Yong (2009) introduced a theory of $K$-jeu de taquin with applications to $K$-theoretic Schubert calculus. The author (2014) studied a $K$-promotion operator $\mathcal{P}$ derived from this theory, but showed that the key fact does not generally extend to $K$-promotion of such increasing tableaux. Here we show that the key fact holds for labels on the boundary of the rectangle. That is, for $T$ a rectanglar increasing tableau with entries bounded by $q$, we have $\mathsf{Frame}(\mathcal{P}^q(T)) = \mathsf{Frame}(T)$, where $\mathsf{Frame}(U)$ denotes the restriction of $U$ to its first and last row and column. Using this fact, we obtain a family of homomesy results on the average value of certain statistics over $K$-promotion orbits, extending a $2$-row theorem of J. Bloom, D. Saracino, and the author (2016) to arbitrary rectangular shapes. ";Combinatorics (math.CO)

Thus, the chromatic number of a tournament $T$ is the minimum number of transitive subtournaments which cover the vertex set of $T$. We show in this paper that tournaments are significantly simpler than graphs with respect to coloring. Indeed, while undirected graphs can be altogether ""locally simple"" (every neighborhood is a stable set) and have large chromatic number, we show that locally simple tournaments are indeed simple. In particular, there is a function $f$ such that if the out-neighborhood of every vertex in a tournament $T$ has chromatic number at most $c$, then $T$ has chromatic number at most $f(c)$.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01675;On a Biased Edge Isoperimetric Inequality for the Discrete Cube; David Ellis,  Nathan Keller,  Noam Lifshitz;  The `full' edge isoperimetric inequality for the discrete cube (due to Harper, Bernstein, Lindsay and Hart) specifies the minimum size of the edge boundary $\partial A$ of a set $A \subset \{0,1\}^n$, as a function of $|A|$. A weaker (but more widely-used) lower bound is $|\partial A| \geq |A| \log_2(2^n/|A|)$, where equality holds iff $A$ is a subcube. In 2011, the first author obtained a sharp `stability' version of the latter result, proving that if $|\partial A| \leq |A| (\log(2^n/|A|)+\epsilon)$, then there exists a subcube $C$ such that $|A \Delta C|/|A| = O(\epsilon /\log(1/\epsilon))$. The `weak' version of the edge isoperimetric inequality has the following well-known generalization for the `$p$-biased' measure $\mu_p$ on the discrete cube: if $p \leq 1/2$, or if $0 < p < 1$ and $A$ is monotone increasing, then $p\mu_p(\partial A) \geq \mu_p(A) \log_p(\mu_p(A))$. In this paper, we prove a sharp stability version of the latter result, which generalizes the aforementioned result of the first author. Namely, we prove that if $p\mu_p(\partial A) \leq \mu_p(A) (\log_p(\mu_p(A))+\epsilon)$, then there exists a subcube $C$ such that $\mu_p(A \Delta C)/\mu_p(A) = O(\epsilon' /\log(1/\epsilon'))$, where $\epsilon' =\epsilon \ln (1/p)$. This result is a central component in recent work of the authors proving sharp stability versions of a number of Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado type theorems in extremal combinatorics, including the seminal `complete intersection theorem' of Ahlswede and Khachatrian. In addition, we prove a biased-measure analogue of the `full' edge isoperimetric inequality, for monotone increasing sets, and we observe that such an analogue does not hold for arbitrary sets, hence answering a question of Kalai. We use this result to give a new proof of the `full' edge isoperimetric inequality, one relying on the Kruskal-Katona theorem. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

Given a $k$-ordering $H$, the ordered Ramsey number $R_<(H)$ is the minimum $n$ such that every edge-2-coloring of the complete graph on the vertex set $\{1, \ldots, n\}$ contains a copy of $H$, the $i$th smallest vertex of which either has order-label $i$ in $H$ or no order-label in $H$. This paper conducts the first systematic study of ordered Ramsey numbers for $1$-orderings of small graphs. We provide upper bounds for $R_<(H)$ for each connected $1$-ordering $H$ on $4$ vertices. Additionally, for every $1$-ordering $H$ of the $n$-vertex path $P_n$, we prove that $R_<(H) \in O(n)$. Finally, we provide an upper bound for the generalized ordered Ramsey number $R_<(K_n, H)$ which can be applied to any $k$-ordering $H$ containing some vertex with order-label $1$. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

The rank number of $G$ is defined to be the smallest $k$ such that $G$ has a $k$-ranking. We find the largest possible directed graph that can be obtained from a directed path or a directed cycle by attaching new edges to the vertices such that the new graphs have the same rank number as the original graphs. The adjacency matrix of the resulting graph is embedded in the Sierpi\'nski triangle. We present a connection between the number of edges that can be added to paths and the Stirling numbers of the second kind. These results are generalized to create directed graphs which are unions of directed paths and directed cycles that maintain the rank number of a base graph of a directed path or a directed cycle. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

Denote by $S_n$ the skew-adjacency matrix of $G_{n,p}^{\sigma}$. Under some mild assumptions, it is proved in this paper that, the spectral distribution of $S_n$ (under some normalization) converges to the standard semicircular law almost surely as $n\rightarrow\infty$.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0110;Evasiveness of Graph Properties and Topological Fixed-Point Theorems; Carl A. Miller;  Many graph properties (e.g., connectedness, containing a complete subgraph) are known to be difficult to check. In a decision-tree model, the cost of an algorithm is measured by the number of edges in the graph that it queries. R. Karp conjectured in the early 1970s that all monotone graph properties are evasive -- that is, any algorithm which computes a monotone graph property must check all edges in the worst case. This conjecture is unproven, but a lot of progress has been made. Starting with the work of Kahn, Saks, and Sturtevant in 1984, topological methods have been applied to prove partial results on the Karp conjecture. This text is a tutorial on these topological methods. I give a fully self-contained account of the central proofs from the paper of Kahn, Saks, and Sturtevant, with no prior knowledge of topology assumed. I also briefly survey some of the more recent results on evasiveness. ;"Combinatorics (math.CO); Computational Complexity (cs.CC); Algebraic Topology (math.AT)"

Seamone (2012) \cite{a80} conjectured that for every graph $G$, $\eta(G)= \eta_{\ell}(G)$. We give a negative answer to this conjecture and we show that for every $k$ there is a graph $G$ such that $ \eta_{\ell}(G)- \eta(G) \geq k$.

This shows that the upper bound of Guth and Katz \cite{GK11} for the related 3-dimensional line-intersection problem is tight for this instance. The gap between this bound and the actual bound of Erdos arises from an application of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality (which is an integral part of the Elekes-Sharir framework).

https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0294;Chip-firing game and partial Tutte polynomial for Eulerian digraphs; Kévin Perrot,  Trung Van Pham;  The Chip-firing game is a discrete dynamical system played on a graph, in which chips move along edges according to a simple local rule. Properties of the underlying graph are of course useful to the understanding of the game, but since a conjecture of Biggs that was proved by Merino L\'opez, we also know that the study of the Chip-firing game can give insights on the graph. In particular, a strong relation between the partial Tutte polynomial $T_G(1,y)$ and the set of recurrent configurations of a Chip-firing game (with a distinguished sink vertex) has been established for undirected graphs. A direct consequence is that the generating function of the set of recurrent configurations is independent of the choice of the sink for the game, as it characterizes the underlying graph itself. In this paper we prove that this property also holds for Eulerian directed graphs (digraphs), a class on the way from undirected graphs to general digraphs. It turns out from this property that the generating function of the set of recurrent configurations of an Eulerian digraph is a natural and convincing candidate for generalizing the partial Tutte polynomial $T_G(1,y)$ to this class. Our work also gives some promising directions of looking for a generalization of the Tutte polynomial to general digraphs. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)

In this paper, we investigate the class of \textbf{$\epsilon$-dense partial Latin squares}:\ partial Latin squares in which each symbol, row, and column contains no more than $\epsilon n$-many nonblank cells. Based on a conjecture of Nash-Williams, Daykin and H\""aggkvist conjectured that all $\frac{1}{4}$-dense partial Latin squares are completable. In this paper, we will discuss the proof methods and results used in previous attempts to resolve this conjecture, introduce a novel technique derived from a paper by Jacobson and Matthews on generating random Latin squares, and use this novel technique to study $ \epsilon$-dense partial Latin squares that contain no more than $\delta n^2$ filled cells in total. In particular, we construct completions for all $ \epsilon$-dense partial Latin squares containing no more than $\delta n^2$ filled cells in total, given that $\epsilon < \frac{1}{12}, \delta < \frac{ \left(1-12\epsilon\right)^{2}}{10409}$. In particular, we show that all $9.8 \cdot 10^{-5}$-dense partial Latin squares are completable. We further show that such completions can always be found in polynomial time. This contrasts a result of Colbourn. In Chapter 3, we strengthen Colbourn's result to the claim that completing an arbitrary $\left(\frac{1}{2} + \epsilon\right)$-dense partial Latin square is NP-complete, for any $\epsilon > 0$. Additional results on triangulations of graphs are found. In an unrelated vein, Chapter 6 explores the class of quasirandom graphs.

More generally, we say that a pair of matrices $(A,B)$, where $A$ and $B$ have the same number of rows, is {\it doubly kernel partition regular\/} if whenever ${\mathbb N}$ is finitely coloured, there exist vectors $\vec x$ and $\vec y$, each monochromatic, such that $A \vec x + B \vec y = 0$. There is an obvious sufficient condition for the pair $(A,B)$ to be doubly kernel partition regular, namely that there exists a positive rational $c$ such that the matrix $M=(\begin{array}{ccccc}A&cB\end{array})$ is kernel partition regular. (That is, whenever ${\mathbb N}$ is finitely coloured, there exists monochromatic $\vec x$ such that $M \vec x=\vec 0$.) Our aim in this paper is to show that this sufficient condition is also necessary. As a consequence we have that a matrix $A$ is doubly image partition regular if and only if there is a positive rational $c$ such that the matrix $(\begin{array}{lr}A&cI\end{array})$ is kernel partition regular, where $I$ is the identity matrix of the appropriate size. We also prove extensions to the case of several matrices. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0461;The Ramsey number of the clique and the hypercube; Gonzalo Fiz Pontiveros,  Simon Griffiths,  Robert Morris,  David Saxton,  Jozef Skokan;  The Ramsey number r(K_s,Q_n) is the smallest positive integer N such that every red-blue colouring of the edges of the complete graph K_N on N vertices contains either a red n-dimensional hypercube, or a blue clique on s vertices. Answering a question of Burr and Erd\H{o}s from 1983, and improving on recent results of Conlon, Fox, Lee and Sudakov, and of the current authors, we show that r(K_s,Q_n) = (s-1) (2^n - 1) + 1 for every s \in \N and every sufficiently large n \in \N. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0473;A polynomial embedding of pairs of orthogonal partial latin squares; D. Donovan,  E. Ş. Yazıcı;  We show that a pair of orthogonal partial latin squares of order $n$ can be embedded in a pair of orthogonal latin squares of order at most $16n^4$ and all orders greater than or equal to $48n^4$. This paper provides the first direct polynomial order embedding construction in the literature. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0531;The number of rank-$k$ flats in a matroid with no $U_{2,n}$-minor; Peter Nelson;  We show that, if $k$ and $\ell$ are positive integers and $r$ is sufficiently large, then the number of rank-$k$ flats in a rank-$r$ matroid $M$ with no $U_{2,\ell+2}$-minor is less than or equal to number of rank-$k$ flats in a rank-$r$ projective geometry over GF$(q)$, where $q$ is the largest prime power not exceeding $\ell$. ;Combinatorics (math.CO)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0616;Asymptotic enumeration of magic series; Michael Quist;  A magic series is a set of natural numbers that, by virtue of its size, sum, and maximum value, could fill a row of a normal magic square. In this paper, we derive an exact two-dimensional integral representation for the number of magic series of order N. By applying the stationary phase approximation, we develop an expansion in powers of 1/N for the number of magic series and calculate the first few terms. We find excellent agreement between our approximation and the known exact values. Related results are presented for magic cube and hypercube series, bimagic series, and trimagic series. ;"Combinatorics (math.CO); Probability (math.PR)"
