https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0026;Simpler proof of the theorem by Pusey, Barrett, and Rudolph on the  reality of the quantum state; C. Moseley;  The theorem of Pusey, Barrett, and Rudolph proves that different quantum states describe different physical realities. Their proof is based on the construction of entanglement measurement bases of two, and more than two qbits. In this note, I show that a two-qubit entanglement base is sufficient for a general proof. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0028;Emergence of stationary many-body entanglement in driven-dissipative  Rydberg lattice gases; S. K. Lee,  J. Cho,  K. S. Choi;"  Non-equilibrium quantum dynamics represents an emerging paradigm for condensed matter physics, quantum information science, and statistical mechanics. Strongly interacting Rydberg atoms offer an attractive platform to study driven-dissipative dynamics of quantum spin models with long-range order. Here, we explore the conditions under which stationary many-body entanglement persists with near-unit fidelity and high scalability. In our approach, coherent many-body dynamics is driven by Rydberg-mediated laser transitions, while atoms at the lattice boundary reduce the entropy of the many-body state. Surprisingly, the many-body entanglement is established by continuously evolving a locally dissipative Rydberg system towards the steady-state, as with optical pumping. We characterize the dynamics of multipartite entanglement in a 1D lattice by way of quantum uncertainty relations, and demonstrate the long-range behavior of the stationary entanglement with finite-size scaling, reaching ""hectapartite"" entanglement under experimental conditions. Our work opens a route towards dissipative preparation of many-body entanglement with unprecedented scaling behavior. ";Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0057;High fidelity state mapping performed in a V-type level structure via  stimulated Raman transition; Grzegorz Chimczak;  It is proved that a qubit encoded in excited states of a V-type quantum system cannot be perfectly transferred to the state of the cavity field mode using a single rectangular laser pulse. This obstacle can be overcome by using a two-stage protocol, in which the fidelity of a state-mapping operation can be increased to nearly one. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0058;Secure quantum weak oblivious transfer against individual measurements; Guang Ping He;  In quantum weak oblivious transfer, Alice sends Bob two bits and Bob can learn one of the bits at his choice. It was found that the security of such a protocol is bounded by $2P_{Alice}^{\ast }+P_{Bob}^{\ast }\geq 2$, where $P_{Alice}^{\ast }$ is the probability with which Alice can guess Bob's choice, and $P_{Bob}^{\ast }$ is the probability with which Bob can guess both of Alice's bits\ given that he learns one of the bits with certainty. Here we propose a protocol and show that as long as Alice is restricted to individual measurements, then both $P_{Alice}^{\ast }$ and $P_{Bob}^{\ast }$ can be made arbitrarily close to 1/2, so that maximal violation of the security bound can be reached. Even with some limited collective attacks, the security bound can still be violated. Therefore, although our protocol still cannot break the bound in principle when Alice has unlimited cheating power, it is sufficient for achieving secure quantum weak oblivious transfer in practice. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0064;Linearity of quantum probability measure and Hardy's model; Kazuo Fujikawa,  C.H. Oh,  Chengjie Zhang;"  We re-examine d=4 hidden-variables-models for a system of two spin-$1/2$ particles in view of the concrete model of Hardy, who analyzed the criterion of entanglement without referring to inequality. The basis of our analysis is the linearity of the probability measure related to the Born probability interpretation, which excludes non-contextual hidden-variables models in $d\geq 3$. To be specific, we note the inconsistency of the non-contextual hidden-variables model in $d=4$ with the linearity of the quantum mechanical probability measure in the sense $\langle\psi|{\bf a}\cdot {\bf \sigma}\otimes{\bf b}\cdot {\bf \sigma}|\psi\rangle+\langle\psi|{\bf a}\cdot {\bf \sigma}\otimes{\bf b}^{\prime}\cdot {\bf \sigma}|\psi\rangle=\langle\psi|{\bf a}\cdot {\bf \sigma}\otimes ({\bf b}+{\bf b}^{\prime})\cdot {\bf \sigma}|\psi\rangle$ for non-collinear ${\bf b}$ and ${\bf b}^{\prime}$. It is then shown that Hardy's model in $d=4$ does not lead to a unique mathematical expression in the demonstration of the discrepancy of local realism (hidden-variables model) with entanglement and thus his proof is incomplete. We identify the origin of this non-uniqueness with the non-uniqueness of translating quantum mechanical expressions into expressions in hidden-variables models, which results from the failure of the above linearity of the probability measure. In contrast, if the linearity of the probability measure is strictly imposed, which is tantamount to asking that the non-contextual hidden-variables model in $d=4$ gives the CHSH inequality $|\langle B\rangle|\leq 2$ uniquely, it is shown that the hidden-variables model can describe only separable quantum mechanical states; this conclusion is in perfect agreement with the so-called Gisin's theorem which states that $|\langle B\rangle|\leq 2$ implies separable states.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0129;Twin paradox with macroscopic clocks in superconducting circuits; Joel Lindkvist,  Carlos Sabín,  Ivette Fuentes,  Andrzej Dragan,  Ida-Maria Svensson,  Per Delsing,  Göran Johansson;  We propose an implementation of a twin paradox scenario in superconducting circuits, with velocities as large as a few percent of the speed of light. Ultrafast modulation of the boundary conditions for the electromagnetic field in a microwave cavity simulates a clock moving at relativistic speeds. Since our cavity has a finite length, the setup allows us to investigate the role of clock size as well as interesting quantum effects on time dilation. In particular, our theoretical results show that the time dilation increases for larger cavity lengths and is shifted due to quantum particle creation. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)"

K. Samanta,  R. P. Singh;  We make a source of entangled photons (SEP) using spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in a non-linear crystal and study the spatial distribution of photon pairs obtained through the down-conversion of different modes of light including higher order vortices. We observe that for the Gaussian pump, the thickness of the SPDC ring varies linearly with the radius of pump beam. However, in case of vortex carrying beams, two concentric SPDC rings are formed for beams above a critical radius. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of SPDC rings increase with increase in the order of optical vortex beams. The presence of a critical beam width for the vortices as well as the observed FWHM of the SPDC rings are supported with our numerical results. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Optics (physics.optics)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0167;Causality Violation and Nonlinear Quantum Mechanics; Jacques Pienaar;  It is currently unknown whether the laws of physics permit time travel into the past. While general relativity indicates the theoretical possibility of causality violation, it is now widely accepted that a theory of quantum gravity must play an essential role in such cases. As a striking example, the logical paradoxes usually associated with causality violation can be resolved by quantum effects. We ask whether the explicit construction of a theory that allows causality violation might in turn teach us something about quantum gravity. Taking the toy model of Deutsch as a starting point, in Part I we argue that, despite being a nonlinear modification of quantum mechanics, the model does not imply superluminal signalling and its predictions can be operationally verified by experimenters within an appropriate ontological setting. In Part II we show that the model can be directly applied to scalar quantum fields, provided the fields are sent back in time by an amount much larger than the coherence time of the wavepackets. We propose a generalisation of the model that lifts this constraint and recovers the predictions of standard quantum field theory when the size of the temporal jump is much smaller than the coherence time of the wavepackets. Finally, we discuss an extension of the model to ordinary gravitational time dilation. The resulting model generalises and extends earlier work on the topic and can be tested experimentally using current technology. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

These probabilities are directly connected to photon localization properties consistent with the entropy of a dilute photon gas found by Einstein. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0176;"A clock containing a massive object in a superposition of states; what  makes Penrosian wavefunction collapse tick?"; Tjerk H. Oosterkamp,  Jan Zaanen;  Penrose has been advocating the view that the collapse of the wave function is rooted in the incompatibility between general relativity and quantum mechanics. On the basis of conceptual analysis, he arrived at an estimate for the collapse time. To better understand his estimate, in this paper we present a thought experiment, which singles out the role of time-dilations in massive superpositions. First we investigate the behavior of a hypothetical clock containing a component which can be in a superposition of states. The clock contains a massive object, whose only purpose is to introduce a curvature of space time into the problem. We find that a state of this massive object with a smaller radius, but with the same mass, experiences a larger time dilation. Considering a coherent superposition of the large and small object, introduces an ambiguity in the definition of a common time for both states. We assert that this time ambiguity can be thought to affect the time evolution of a state in different ways and that the relative phase difference between these different interpretations can be calculated. We postulate that the wave function collapse will occur when this phase difference becomes of order unity. An absolute energy scale enters this equation and we recover Penrose's estimate for the collapse time by equating the absolute energy scale to the rest mass of the object. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

However, different such coin toss operators lead to equivalent dynamics of the quantum walker. In this manuscript we present the unitary equivalence classes of quantum walks and show that all the nonequivalent quantum walks can be distinguished by a single parameter. Moreover, we argue that the electric quantum walks are equivalent to quantum walks with time dependent coin toss operator. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

This accuracy and speed is suitable for advanced multi-qubit experiments including surface code error correction. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0286;Testing Superdeterministic Conspiracy; Sabine Hossenfelder;  Tests of Bell's theorem rule out local hidden variables theories. But any theorem is only as good as the assumptions that go into it, and one of these assumptions is that the experimenter can freely chose the detector settings. Without this assumption, one enters the realm of superdeterministic hidden variables theories and can no longer use Bell's theorem as a criterion. One can like or not like such superdeterministic hidden variables theories and their inevitable nonlocality, the real question is how one can test them. Here, we propose a possible experiment that could reveal superdeterminism. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0436;Optical interference in view of the probability distribution of photon  detection; Toru Kawakubo,  Katsuji Yamamoto;  We investigate interference of optical fields by examining the probability distribution of photon detection. The usual description of interference patterns in terms of superposition of classical mean fields with definite phases is elucidated in quantum fashion. Especially, for interference of two independent mixtures of number states with Poissonian or sub-Poissonian statistics, despite lack of intrinsic phases, it is found that the joint probability has a distinct peak manifold in the multi-dimensional space of the detector outcomes, which is along the trajectory of the mean-field values as the relative phase varies on the unit circle. Then, an interference pattern should mostly appear in each shot of measurement as a point in the peak manifold with a randomly chosen relative phase. On the other hand, for super-Poissonian sources the mean-field description is likely invalidated with rather broad probability distributions. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0439;Single- and coupled-channel radial inverse scattering with  supersymmetric transformations; Daniel Baye,  Jean-Marc Sparenberg,  Andrey M Pupasov-Maksimov,  Boris F Samsonov;  The present status of the coupled-channel inverse-scattering method with supersymmetric transformations is reviewed. We first revisit in a pedagogical way the single-channel case, where the supersymmetric approach is shown to provide a complete solution to the inverse-scattering problem. A special emphasis is put on the differences between conservative and non-conservative transformations. In particular, we show that for the zero initial potential, a non-conservative transformation is always equivalent to a pair of conservative transformations. These single-channel results are illustrated on the inversion of the neutron-proton triplet eigenphase shifts for the S and D waves. We then summarize and extend our previous works on the coupled-channel case and stress remaining difficulties and open questions. We mostly concentrate on two-channel examples to illustrate general principles while keeping mathematics as simple as possible. In particular, we discuss the difference between the equal-threshold and different-threshold problems. For equal thresholds, conservative transformations can provide non-diagonal Jost and scattering matrices. Iterations of such transformations are shown to lead to practical algorithms for inversion. A convenient technique where the mixing parameter is fitted independently of the eigenphases is developed with iterations of pairs of conjugate transformations and applied to the neutron-proton triplet S-D scattering matrix, for which exactly-solvable matrix potential models are constructed. For different thresholds, conservative transformations do not seem to be able to provide a non-trivial coupling between channels. In contrast, a single non-conservative transformation can generate coupled-channel potentials starting from the zero potential and is a promising first step towards a full solution to the coupled-channel inverse problem with threshold differences. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0456;New Approach to Quantum Error Correction; Ri Qu,  Bing-jian Shang,  Yan-ru Bao,  Yi-ping Ma;  Operator quantum error correction provides a unified framework for the known techniques of quantum error correction such as the standard error correction model, the method of decoherence-free subspaces, and the noiseless subsystem method. We first show an example of a new quantum error correction scheme which can not be described by operation quantum error correction. Then we introduce a different notion of noiseless subsystems according to the example. Base on this notion, we present a more unified approach which incorporates operator quantum error correction as a special case. Moreover, we also give a sufficient and necessary condition of quantum error correction using this approach. We show that this approach provides more recovery operations than operator quantum error correction, which possibly leads to simpler decoding procedures. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0566;Detecting the work statistics through Ramsey-like interferometry; Laura Mazzola,  Gabriele De Chiara,  Mauro Paternostro;  Out-of-equilibrium statistical mechanics is attracting considerable interest due to the recent advances in the control and manipulations of systems at the quantum level. Recently, an interferometric scheme for the detection of the characteristic function of the work distribution following a time-dependent process has been proposed [L. Mazzola {\it et al}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 110} 230602 (2013)]. There, it was demonstrated that the work statistics of a quantum system undergoing a process can be reconstructed by effectively mapping the characteristic function of work on the state of an ancillary qubit. Here, we expand that work in two important directions. We first apply the protocol to an interesting specific physical example consisting of a superconducting qubit dispersively coupled to the field of a microwave resonator, thus enlarging the class of situations for which our scheme would be key in the task highlighted above. We then account for the interaction of the system with an additional one (which might embody an environment), and generalise the protocol accordingly. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0596;Quantum fisher information in noninertial frames; Yao Yao,  Xing Xiao,  Li Ge,  Xiao-guang Wang,  Chang-pu Sun;  We investigate the performance of quantum fisher information under the Unruh-Hawking effect, where one of the observers (eg, Rob) is uniformly accelerated with respect to other partners. In the context of relativistic quantum information theory, we demonstrate that quantum fisher information, as an important measure of the information content of quantum states, has a rich and subtle physical structure comparing with entanglement or Bell nonlocality. In this work, we mainly focus on the parameterized (and arbitrary) pure two-qubit states, where the weight parameter $\theta$ and phase parameter $\phi$ are naturally introduced. Intriguingly, we prove that $\mathcal{F}_\theta$ keeps unchanged for both scalar and Dirac fields. Meanwhile, we observe that $\mathcal{F}_\phi$ decreases with the increase of acceleration $r$ but remains finite in the limit of infinite acceleration. More importantly, our results show that the symmetry of $\mathcal{F}_\phi$ (with respect to $\theta=\pi/4$) has been broken by the influence of Unruh effect for both cases. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

Such light will show new intensity-intensity correlations involving both path and polarization phases, formally similar to those for four-particle GHZ states. For fixed polarization phases, the correlations reduce to the Hanbury Brown-Twiss phase correlations. It is also shown that these classical correlations violate noncontextuality. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

By following a superposition of two eigenstates of the system, a single cold particle is completely transferred to the degenerate first excited states of the final trap, which are resonantly coupled via tunneling to the ground states of the initial and middle traps. Depending on the total time of the process, angular momentum is generated in the final trap, with values that oscillate between $\pm\hbar$. This process is discussed in terms of the asymptotic eigenstates of the individual wells and the results have been checked by simulations of the full two-dimensional Schr\""odinger equation.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0671;Few-body Physics in a Many-body World; N. T. Zinner;  The study of quantum mechanical few-body systems is a century old pursuit relevant to countless subfields of physics. While the two-body problem is generally considered to be well-understood theoretically and numerically, venturing to three or more bodies brings about complications but also a host of interesting phenomena. In recent years, the cooling and trapping of atoms and molecules has shown great promise to provide a highly controllable environment to study few-body physics. However, as is true for many systems where few-body effects play an important role the few-body states are not isolated from their many-body environment. An interesting question then becomes if or (more precisely) when we should consider few-body states as effectively isolated and when we have to take the coupling to the environment into account. Using some simple, yet non-trivial, examples I will try to suggest possible approaches to this line of research. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)"

Bollinger;  We employ spin-dependent optical dipole forces to characterize the transverse center-of-mass (COM) motional mode of a two-dimensional Wigner crystal of hundreds of $^9$Be$^+$. By comparing the measured spin dephasing produced by the spin-dependent force with the predictions of a semiclassical dephasing model, we obtain absolute mode temperatures in excellent agreement with both the Doppler laser cooling limit and measurements obtained from a previously published technique (B. C. Sawyer et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{108}, 213003 (2012)). Furthermore, the structure of the dephasing histograms allows for discrimination between initial thermal and coherent states of motion. We also apply the techniques discussed here to measure, for the first time, the ambient heating rate of the COM mode of a 2D Coulomb crystal in a Penning trap. This measurement places an upper limit on the anomalous single-ion heating rate due to electric field noise from the trap electrode surfaces of $\frac{d\bar{n}}{dt}\sim 5$ s$^{-1}$ for our trap at a frequency of 795 kHz, where $\bar{n}$ is the mean occupation of quantized COM motion in the axial harmonic well. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)"

We derive a general expression which allows one to compute this energy dissipation rate for a heat bath consisting of a large number of harmonic oscillators, and work out two analytically solvable model examples. In particular, we distinguish between genuine transitions effectuating a change of the systems's Floquet state, and pseudo-transitions preserving that state; the latter are shown to yield an important contribution to the total dissipation rate. Our results suggest possible driving-mediated heating and cooling schemes on the quantum level. They also indicate that a driven system does not necessarily occupy only a single Floquet state when being in contact with a zero-temperature bath. ";Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

Our approach is based on the field-theoretic concept of the effective potential, which provides a natural extension of the Landau theory of phase transitions to quantum critical phenomena. The coefficients of the Landau expansion of that effective potential are obtained by high-order perturbation theory. We counteract the divergency of the weak-coupling perturbation series by including the seldom considered Landau coefficient $a_6$ into our analysis. Our preliminary results indicate that the critical exponents for both the condensate density and the superfluid density, as derived from the two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model, deviate by less than $1\%$ from the best known estimates computed so far for the three-dimensional $XY$ universality class. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)"

Our model corresponds to the case of a single linear diabatic energy level interacting with a band of an arbitrary N states, for which the diabatic energies decay with time according to the Coulomb law. We show that the time-dependent Schroedingier equation for this system can be solved in terms of Meijer functions whose asymptotics at a large time can be compactly written in terms of elementary functions that depend on the roots of an Nth order characteristic polynomial. Our model can be considered a generalization of the Demkov-Osherov model. In comparison to the latter, our model allows one to explore the role of curvature of the band levels and diabatic avoided crossings. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)"

Maghrebi,  Robert L.

A rotating object exhibits a quantum instability by dissipating its mechanical motion via spontaneous emission of photons, as well as internal heat generation. Universal relations are derived for the radiated energy and angular momentum as trace formulas involving the object's scattering matrix. We also compute the quantum noise by deriving the full statistics of the radiated photons out of thermal and/or dynamic equilibrium. The (entanglement) entropy generation is quantified, and the total entropy is shown to be always increasing. Furthermore, we derive a Fokker-Planck equation governing the stochastic angular motion resulting from the fluctuating back-reaction frictional torque. As a result, we find a quantum limit on the uncertainty of the object's angular velocity in steady rotation. Finally, we show in some detail that a rotating object drags nearby objects, making them spin parallel to its axis of rotation. A scalar toy model is introduced in the first part to simplify the technicalities and ease the conceptual complexities; a detailed discussion of quantum electrodynamics is presented in the second part.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0899;Assisted optimal state discrimination without entanglement; Li-Fang Xu,  Fu-Lin Zhang,  Mai-Lin Liang,  Jing-Ling Chen;  A fundamental problem in quantum information is to explore the roles of different quantum correlations in a quantum information procedure. Recent work [Phys. Rev. Lett., 107 (2011) 080401] shows that the protocol for assisted optimal state discrimination (AOSD) may be implemented successfully without entanglement, but with another correlation, quantum dissonance. However, both the original work and the extension to discrimination of $d$ states [Phys. Rev. A, 85 (2012) 022328] have only proved that entanglement can be absent in the case with equal a \emph{priori} probabilities. By improving the protocol in [Sci. Rep., 3 (2013) 2134], we investigate this topic in a simple case to discriminate three nonorthogonal states of a qutrit, with positive real overlaps. In our procedure, the entanglement between the qutrit and an auxiliary qubit is found to be completely unnecessary. This result shows that the quantum dissonance may play as a key role in optimal state discrimination assisted by a qubit for more general cases. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0912;Rational approximations and quantum algorithms with postselection; Urmila Mahadev (UC Berkeley),  Ronald de Wolf (CWI and University of Amsterdam);  We study the close connection between rational functions that approximate a given Boolean function, and quantum algorithms that compute the same function using postselection. We show that the minimal degree of the former equals (up to a factor of 2) the minimal query complexity of the latter. We give optimal (up to constant factors) quantum algorithms with postselection for the Majority function, slightly improving upon an earlier algorithm of Aaronson. Finally we show how Newman's classic theorem about low-degree rational approximation of the absolute-value function follows from these algorithms. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Computational Complexity (cs.CC)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0946;A classical channel model for gravitational decoherence; D. Kafri,  J.M. Taylor,  G. J. Milburn;  We show that, by treating the gravitational interaction between two mechanical resonators as a classical measurement channel, a gravitational decoherence model results that is equivalent to a model first proposed by Diosi. The resulting decoherence model implies that the classically mediated gravitational interaction between two gravitationally coupled resonators cannot create entanglement. The gravitational decoherence rate ( and the complementary heating rate) is of the order of the gravitationally induced normal mode splitting of the two resonators. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)"

We derive an exact formula and show that the Krishna-Voth formula can be derived as an approximation of our formula. Some properties of this approximation are clarified through a model calculation of the position autocorrelation function for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator. A key observation is that the Krishna-Voth correlation function has a term which behaves as the secular term in perturbation theory. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0990;Maximal tree size of few-qubit states; Huy Nguyen Le,  Yu Cai,  Xingyao Wu,  Rafael Rabelo,  Valerio Scarani;"  Tree size ($\rm{TS}$) is an interesting measure of complexity for multiqubit states: not only is it in principle computable, but one can obtain lower bounds for it. In this way, it has been possible to identify families of states whose complexity scales superpolynomially in the number of qubits. With the goal of progressing in the systematic study of the mathematical property of $\rm{TS}$, in this work we characterize the tree size of pure states for the case where the number of qubits is small, namely, 3 or 4. The study of three qubits does not hold great surprises, insofar as the structure of entanglement is rather simple; the maximal $\rm{TS}$ is found to be 8, reached for instance by the $|\rm{W}\rangle$ state. The study of four qubits yields several insights: in particular, the most economic description of a state is found not to be recursive. The maximal $\rm{TS}$ is found to be 16, reached for instance by a state called $|\Psi^{(4)}\rangle$ which was already discussed in the context of four-photon down-conversion experiments. We also find that the states with maximal tree size form a set of zero measure: a smoothed version of tree size over a neighborhood of a state ($\epsilon-\rm{TS}$) reduces the maximal values to 6 and 14, respectively. Finally, we introduce a notion of tree size for mixed states and discuss it for a one-parameter family of states. ";Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.1012;Consistent theory for causal non-locality beyond Born's rule; Wonmin Son;  According to the theory of relativity and causality, a special type of correlation beyond quantum mechanics is possible in principle under the name of {\it non-local box}. The concept has been introduced from the principle of non-locality which satisfies relativistic causality. In this paper, we show that a correlation leading to the non-local box is possible to be derived consistently if we release the one of major axioms in quantum mechanics, {\it Born's rule}. This allows us to obtain a theory which in one end of the spectrum agrees with the classical probability and in the other end, agrees with the theory of non-local causality. At the same time, we argue that the correlation lies in a space with special mathematical constraints such that a physical realization of the correlation through a probability measure is not possible in one direction of its limit and is possible in the other limit. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

We derive an optimized entropic uncertainty relation (EUR) that quantifies an amount of quantum uncertainty in the scenario of successive measurements. The EUR characterizes the limitation in the measurability of two different quantities of a quantum state when they are measured through successive measurements. We find that the bound quantifies the information between the two measurements and imposes a condition that is consistent with the recently-derived error-disturbance relationship. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.1126;Non-Markovianity criteria for open system dynamics; N. Lo Gullo,  I. Sinayskiy,  Th. Busch,  F. Petruccione;  A universal definition of non-Markovianity for open systems dynamics is proposed. It is extended from the classical definition to the quantum realm by showing that a `transition' from the Markov to the non-Markov regime occurs when the correlations between the system and the environment, generated by their joint evolution, can no longer be neglected. The suggested definition is based on the comparison between measured correlation functions and those built by assuming that the system is in a Markov regime thus giving a figure of merit of the error coming from this assumption. It is shown that the knowledge of the dynamical map and initial condition of the system is not enough to fully characterise the non-Markovian dynamics of the reduced system. The example of three exactly solvable models, i.e. decoherence and spontaneous emission of the qubit in a bosonic bath and decoherence of the photon's polarization induced by interaction with its spacial degrees of freedom, reveals that previously proposed Markovianity criteria and measures which are based on dynamical map analysis fail to recognise non-Markov behaviour. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.1184;Classical and quantum shortcuts to adiabaticity for scale-invariant  driving; Sebastian Deffner,  Christopher Jarzynski,  Adolfo del Campo;  A shortcut to adiabaticity is a driving protocol that reproduces in a short time the same final state that would result from an adiabatic, infinitely slow process. A powerful technique to engineer such shortcuts relies on the use of auxiliary counterdiabatic fields. Determining the explicit form of the required fields has generally proven to be complicated. We present explicit counterdiabatic driving protocols for scale-invariant dynamical processes, which describe for instance expansion and transport. To this end, we use the formalism of generating functions, and unify previous approaches independently developed in classical and quantum studies. The resulting framework is applied to the design of shortcuts to adiabaticity for a large class of classical and quantum, single-particle, non-linear, and many-body systems. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.1219;Consciousness as a State of Matter; Max Tegmark (MIT);"  We examine the hypothesis that consciousness can be understood as a state of matter, ""perceptronium"", with distinctive information processing abilities. We explore five basic principles that may distinguish conscious matter from other physical systems such as solids, liquids and gases: the information, integration, independence, dynamics and utility principles. If such principles can identify conscious entities, then they can help solve the quantum factorization problem: why do conscious observers like us perceive the particular Hilbert space factorization corresponding to classical space (rather than Fourier space, say), and more generally, why do we perceive the world around us as a dynamic hierarchy of objects that are strongly integrated and relatively independent? Tensor factorization of matrices is found to play a central role, and our technical results include a theorem about Hamiltonian separability (defined using Hilbert-Schmidt superoperators) being maximized in the energy eigenbasis. Our approach generalizes Giulio Tononi's integrated information framework for neural-network-based consciousness to arbitrary quantum systems, and we find interesting links to error-correcting codes, condensed matter criticality, and the Quantum Darwinism program, as well as an interesting connection between the emergence of consciousness and the emergence of time.

Within this restricted space, the graph isomorphism problem can be translated into the search of a satisfying assignment to a 2-SAT formula without resorting to perturbation gadgets or projective techniques. We present an analysis of the execution time of the algorithm on small instances of the graph isomorphism problem and discuss the issue of an implementation of the proposed adiabatic scheme on current quantum computing hardware. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

For this demonstration, we developed a simple method that repeatedly monitors the atomic phase while retaining its coherence by observing only a portion of the whole ion cloud. Using this new method, we measured the continuous phase over 3 measurement cycles, and thereby improved the stability scaling from $\tau^{-1/2}$ to $\tau^{-1}$ during the 3 measurement cycles. %Compared with the standard method that initialize phase during each measurement cycle, the long term stability was improved by a factor of $\sqrt{n_{cp}}$ (where $n_{cp}$ is the number of continuous phase measurements). This simple method provides a path by which atomic clocks can approach a quantum projection noise limit, even when the measurement noise is dominated by the technical noise. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.1338;Measurement-device-independent randomness from local entangled states; Anubhav Chaturvedi,  Manik Banik;  Nonlocal correlations are useful for device independent (DI) randomness certification [Nature (London) {\bf 464}, 1021 (2010)]. The advantage of this DI protocol over the conventional quantum protocol is that randomness can be certified even when experimental apparatuses are not trusted. Quantum entanglement is the necessary physical source for the nonlocal correlation required for such DI task. However, nonlocality and entanglement are distinct concepts. There exist entangled states which produce no nonlocal correlation and hence are not useful for the DI randomness certification task. Here we introduce the measurement-device-independent randomness certification task where one has trusted quantum state preparation device but the measurement devices are completely unspecified. Interestingly we show that there exist entangled states, with local description, that are useful resource in such task which otherwise are useless in corresponding DI scenario. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

This entanglement is induced by the radiation pressure of a single photon hopping between the two cavities. Our results are analytical, so that the entangled states are explicitly shown. Up to local operations, these states are two-mode three-component states, and hence the degree of entanglement can be well quantified by the concurrence. By analyzing the system parameters, we find that, to achieve a maximum average entanglement, the system should work in the single-photon strong-coupling regime and the deep-resolved-sideband regime. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.1388;Entanglement sharing through noisy qubit channels: One-shot optimal  singlet fraction; Rajarshi Pal,  Somshubhro Bandyopadhyay,  Sibasish Ghosh;  Maximally entangled states--a resource for quantum information processing--can only be shared through noiseless quantum channels, whereas in practice channels are noisy. Here we ask: Given a noisy quantum channel, what is the maximum attainable purity (measured by singlet fraction) of shared entanglement for single channel use and local trace preserving operations? We find an exact formula of the maximum singlet fraction attainable for a qubit channel and give an explicit protocol to achieve the optimal value. The protocol distinguishes between unital and nonunital channels and requires no local post-processing. In particular, the optimal singlet fraction is achieved by transmitting part of an appropriate pure entangled state, which is maximally entangled if and only if the channel is unital. A linear function of the optimal singlet fraction is also shown to be an upper bound on the distillable entanglement of the mixed state dual to the channel. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.1418;Influence of Non-Markovian Dynamics in Thermal-Equilibrium  Uncertainty-Relations; Leonardo A. Pachon,  Johan F. Triana,  David Zueco,  Paul Brumer;  Contrary to the conventional wisdom that deviations from standard thermodynamics originate from the strong coupling to the bath, it is shown that in quantum mechanics, these deviations originate from the uncertainty principle and are supported by the non-Markovian character of the dynamics. Specifically, it is shown that the lower bound of the dispersion of the total energy of the system, imposed by the uncertainty principle, is dominated by the bath power spectrum and therefore, quantum mechanics inhibits the system thermal-equilibrium-state from being described by the canonical Boltzmann's distribution. We show that for a wide class of systems, systems interacting via central forces with pairwise-self-interacting environments, this general observation is in sharp contrast to the classical case, for which the thermal equilibrium distribution, irrespective of the interaction strength, is \emph{exactly} characterized by the canonical Boltzmann distribution and therefore, no dependence on the bath power spectrum is present. We define an \emph{effective coupling} to the environment that depends on all energy scales in the system and reservoir interaction. Sample computations in regimes predicted by this effective coupling are demonstrated. For example, for the case of strong effective coupling, deviations from standard thermodynamics are present and, for the case of weak effective coupling, quantum features such as stationary entanglement are possible at high temperatures. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)"

The low-lying energies of bound states are found in closed form for the large couplings $g$.

These are then introduced macroscopically by solving Maxwell's equations. This procedure is convenient and intuitive but ad hoc. We show that both effects emerge naturally by including coupling to quantum modes of the radiation field in the vacuum state to second order. This approach is systematic and suggests a more general class of corrections that only arise in a QED framework. In the semi-classical theory, which only includes classical field modes, the susceptibility of a collection of $N$ non-interacting molecules is additive and scales as $N$. Second-order coupling to a vacuum mode generates an effective retarded interaction that leads to cascading and local field effects both of which scale as $N^2$. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

In particular, we study the quantum pure state tomography problem in finite dimensions from the point of view of dynamical systems and bifurcations theory. First, we introduce a generalization of the Hellinger metric for probability distributions which allows us to find a geometrical interpretation of the quantum state tomography problem. Thereafter, we prove that every solution to the state tomography problem is an attractive fixed point of the so-called physical imposition operator. Additionally, we demonstrate that multiple states corresponding to the same experimental data are associated to bifurcations of this operator. Such a kind of bifurcations only occurs when informationally incomplete set of observables are considered. Finally, we prove that the physical imposition operator has a non-contractive Lipschitz constant 2 for the Bures metric. This value of the Lipschitz constant manifests the existence of the quantum tomography problem for pure states. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

Large networks, however, are often not free from defects, which can appear randomly between the lattice sites and are caused either by production faults or deliberate introduction. In this work we present numerical simulations of the behaviour of a single photon injected into a regular lattice of beam-splitting components in the presence of defects that cause perfect backward reflections. We find that the photon dynamics is quickly dominated by the backscattering processes, and a small fraction of reflectors in the paths of the beam-splitting array strongly affects the percolation probability of the photon. We carefully examine such systems and show an interesting interplay between the probabilities of percolation, backscattering and temporary localization. We also discuss the sensitivity of these probabilities to lattice size, timescale, injection point, fraction of reflectors and boundary conditions. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

However, the environment was in a pure state and the fundamental problem was how generic and robust is the conclusion. Here we prove that despite of the initial environmental noise the emergence of the broadcast structure still holds, leading to the perceived objectivity of the state of the object. We also show how this leads to a quantum Darwinism-type condition, reflecting classicality of proliferated information in terms of a limit behavior of the mutual information. Quite surprisingly, we find ,,singular points'' of the decoherence, which can be used to faithfully broadcast a specific classical message through the noisy environment. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

Birgitta Whaley;  Controlled phase (CPHASE) gates can in principle be realized with trapped neutral atoms by making use of the Rydberg blockade. Achieving the ultra-high fidelities required for quantum computation with such Rydberg gates is however compromised by experimental inaccuracies in pulse amplitudes and timings, as well as by stray fields that cause fluctuations of the Rydberg levels. We report here a comparative study of analytic and numerical pulse sequences for the Rydberg CPHASE gate that specifically examines the robustness of the gate fidelity with respect to such experimental perturbations. Analytical pulse sequences of both simultaneous and stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) are found to be at best moderately robust under these perturbations. In contrast, optimal control theory is seen to allow generation of numerical pulses that are inherently robust within a predefined tolerance window. The resulting numerical pulse shapes display simple modulation patterns and their spectra contain only one additional frequency beyond the basic resonant Rydberg gate frequencies. Pulses of such low complexity should be experimentally feasible, allowing gate fidelities of order 99.90 - 99.99% to be achievable under realistic experimental conditions. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.1869;Self-avoiding quantum walks; Elizabeth Camilleri,  Peter P. Rohde,  Jason Twamley;  Quantum walks exhibit many unique characteristics compared to classical random walks. In the classical setting, self-avoiding random walks have been studied as a variation on the usual classical random walk. Classical self-avoiding random walks have found numerous applications, most notably in the modeling of protein folding. We consider the analogous problem in the quantum setting. We complement a quantum walk with a memory register that records where the walker has previously resided. The walker is then able to avoid returning back to previously visited sites. We parameterise the strength of the memory recording and the strength of the memory back-action on the walker's motion, and investigate their effect on the dynamics of the walk. We find that by manipulating these parameters the walk can be made to reproduce ideal quantum or classical random walk statistics, or a plethora of more elaborate diffusive phenomena. In some parameter regimes we observe a close correspondence between classical self-avoiding random walks and the quantum self-avoiding walk. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

We employ quantum metrology techniques to demonstrate the possibility for high precision estimation for the volume rate of the expanding universe. We show that the optimal precision of the estimation depends sensitively on the dimensionless mass $\tilde{m}$ and dimensionless momentum $\tilde{k}$ of the Dirac particles. The optimal precision for the ratio estimation peaks at some finite dimensionless mass $\tilde{m}$ and momentum $\tilde{k}$. We find that the precision of the estimation can be improved by choosing the probe state as an eigenvector of the hamiltonian. This occurs because the largest quantum Fisher information is obtained by performing projective measurements implemented by the projectors onto the eigenvectors of specific probe states. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)"

In this protocol, the hyperentangled state is encoded in both polarization and momentum degrees of freedom. We show that the concurrences of both polarization and momentum entanglement can be conversed into the total success probability of picking up the odd-parity state and can be measured directly. This protocol requires the weak cross-Kerr nonlinearity to construct the quantum nondemolition measurement and does not resort to the sophisticated controlled-not gate operation. It is feasible in current experimental technology. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.2110;Local unitary symmetries and entanglement invariants; Markus Johansson;  We investigate the relation between local unitary symmetries and entanglement invariants of multi-qubit systems. The Hilbert space of such systems can be stratified in terms of states with different types of symmetry. We review the connection between this stratification and the ring of entanglement invariants and the corresponding geometric description in terms of algebraic varieties. On a stratum of a non-trivial symmetry group the invariants of the symmetry preserving operations gives a sufficient description of entanglement. Finding these invariants is often a simpler problem than finding the invariants of the local unitary group. The conditions, as given by the Luna-Richardson theorem, for when the ring of such invariants is isomorphic to the ring of local unitary invariants on the stratum are discussed. As an example we consider symmetry groups that can be diagonalized by local unitary operations and for which the group action on each qubit is non-trivial. On the stratum of such a symmetry the entanglement can be described in terms of a canonical form and the invariants of the symmetry preserving operations. This canonical form and the invariants are directly determined by the symmetry group. Further, we briefly discuss how some recently proposed entanglement classification schemes capture symmetry properties. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

At the core of our algorithms are fast and coherent quantum methods for computing distance metrics such as the inner product and Euclidean distance. We prove upper bounds on the number of queries to the input data required to compute these metrics. In the worst case, our quantum algorithms lead to polynomial reductions in query complexity relative to the corresponding classical algorithm. In certain cases, we show exponential or even super-exponential reductions over the classical analog. We study the performance of our quantum nearest-neighbor algorithms on several real-world binary classification tasks and find that the classification accuracy is competitive with classical methods. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

To check whether consciousness as an entity leaves a physical trace, we propose that laboratory searches for such a trace should be for nonlocality, where probabilities do not conform to local expectations. Starting with the idea that nonlocality may be veiled as one of the ways cosmic censorship operates, we further argue that in order to preserve the ordinary objective reality described by local realism and general relativity, veiled nonlocality and cosmic censorship are indispensable operational aspects of the interactions of observers with physical systems. Nevertheless, it may be possible to indirectly detect traces of nonlocality in experiments where humans and other sentient subjects are involved ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

Munro;  Boson-sampling is a highly simplified, but non-universal, approach to implementing optical quantum computation. It was shown by Aaronson and Arkhipov that this protocol cannot be efficiently classically simulated unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses, which would be a shocking result in computational complexity theory. Based on this, numerous authors have made the claim that experimental boson-sampling would provide evidence against, or disprove, the Extended Church-Turing thesis -- that any physically realisable system can be efficiently simulated on a Turing machine. We argue against this claim on the basis that, under a general, physically realistic independent error model, boson-sampling does not implement a provably hard computational problem in the asymptotic limit of large systems. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

For example, the quantum LQG and quantum H infinity optimal control problems remain open. To make further progress, new, systematic and tractable methods need to be developed. This paper gives three algorithms for designing coherent observers, i.e., quantum systems that are connected to a quantum plant and their outputs provide information about the internal state of the plant. Importantly, coherent observers avoid measurements of the plant outputs. We compare our coherent observers with a classical (measurement-based) observer by way of an example involving an optical cavity with thermal and vacuum noises as inputs. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

No measurement is performed in the feedback loop, and we suggest a simple all-optical implementation for a cavity QED system. We demonstrate the potential of the scheme by applying it to a driven and dissipative Dicke model, as recently realized in a quantum gas experiment. The time to reach steady state can then reduced by two orders of magnitude for parameters taken from experiment, making previously inaccessible long time attractors reachable within typical experimental run times. The scheme also offers the possibility of slowing down the dynamics, as well as qualitatively changing the phase diagram of the corresponding physical system. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)"

Testing such inequalities in the quantum realm usually involves either measurements of two--valued quantum observables or pre-defining a context dependent binning procedure. Here we establish the conditions to test the Clauser-Horne-Shimony and Holt inequality using any quantum observable. Our result applies to observables with an arbitrary spectrum and no prior knowledge of their underlying Hilbert space's dimension is required. Finally, we demonstrate the proposed general measurement strategy, that can be seen as positive operator valued measurements performed on the system, using the formalism of modular variables applied to the transverse degrees of freedom of single photons. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

If the strength of the in- and outcoupling is increased two $\mathcal{PT}$ broken states bifurcate from the $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric ground state. At this bifurcation point a stability change of the ground state is expected. However, it is observed that this stability change does not occur exactly at the bifurcation but at a slightly different strength of the in-/outcoupling effect. We investigate a Bose-Einstein condensate in a $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric double-$\delta$ potential and calculate the stationary states. The ground state's stability is analysed by means of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations and it is shown that the difference in the strength of the in-/outcoupling between the bifurcation and the stability change can be completely explained by the norm-dependency of the nonlinear term in the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD)"

Using micro-macro entanglement of light as recently demonstrated experimentally, one can then create opto-mechanical entangled states where the components of the superposition are macroscopically different. We apply this general approach to two-mode squeezed states where one mode has undergone a large displacement.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.2421;Partitions and Objective Indefiniteness in Quantum Mechanics; David Ellerman;"  Classical physics and quantum physics suggest two meta-physical types of reality: the classical notion of a objectively definite reality with properties ""all the way down,"" and the quantum notion of an objectively indefinite type of reality. The problem of interpreting quantum mechanics (QM) is essentially the problem of making sense out of an objectively indefinite reality. These two types of reality can be respectively associated with the two mathematical concepts of subsets and quotient sets (or partitions) which are category-theoretically dual to one another and which are developed in two mathematical logics, the usual Boolean logic of subsets and the more recent logic of partitions. Our sense-making strategy is ""follow the math"" by showing how the logic and mathematics of set partitions can be transported in a natural way to Hilbert spaces where it yields the mathematical machinery of QM--which shows that the mathematical framework of QM is a type of logical system over the complex numbers. And then we show how the machinery of QM can be transported the other way down to the set-like vector spaces over Z_2 showing how the classical logical finite probability calculus (in a ""non-commutative"" version) is a type of ""quantum mechanics"" over Z_2, i.e., over sets. In this way, we try to make sense out of objective indefiniteness and thus to interpret quantum mechanics. ";"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); History and Philosophy of Physics (physics.hist-ph)"

In this work, we quantify this level of tolerance, numerically studying the effects of many-qubit errors on the performance of the surface code. We find that if increasingly large area errors are at least moderately exponentially suppressed, arbitrarily reliable quantum computation can still be achieved with practical overhead. We furthermore quantify the effect of non-local two-qubit correlated errors, which would be expected in arrays of qubits coupled by a polynomially decaying interaction, and when using many-qubit coupling devices. We surprisingly find that the surface code is very robust to this class of errors, despite a provable lack of a threshold error rate when such errors are present. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

This protocol has three advantages: First, we do not require the sophisticated controlled-not (CNOT) gates. Second, the distributed atoms are not required to intact with each other. Third, the atomic entanglement can be distributed nonlocally, which provides its important applications in distributed quantum computation. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.2535;Quantum dynamics and entanglement in coherent transport of atomic  population; M.K. Olsen;  In this work we look at the quantum dynamics of the process known as either transport without transit (TWT), or coherent transfer of atomic population (CTAP), of a Bose-Einstein condensate from one well of a lattice potential to another, non-adjacent well, without macroscopic occupation of the well between the two. This process has previously been analysed and in this work we extend those analyses by considering the effects of quantum statistics on the dynamics and entanglement properties of the condensate modes in the two relevant wells. In order to do this, we go beyond the mean-field analysis of the Gross-Pitaevskii type approach and utilise the phase-space stochastic methods so well known in quantum optics. In particular, we use the exact positive-P representation where it is suitable, and the approximate truncated WIgner representation otherwise. We find strong agreement between the results of these two methods, with the mean-field dynamics not depending on the initial quantum states of the trapped condensate. We find that the entanglement properties do depend strongly on the initial quantum states, with quantitatively different results found for coherent and Fock states. Comparison of the two methods gives us confidence that the truncated Wigner representation delivers accurate results for this system and is thus a useful method as the collisional nonlinearity increases and the positive-P results fail to converge. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)"

However, the question remains of how negative probabilities are to be interpreted. In this paper, we present an operational interpretation of negative probabilities as arising from standard probabilities on signed events. This leads, by virtue of our previous result, to a systematic scheme for simulating arbitrary no-signalling models. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

The control laws are composed of two-direction components, one is used to eliminate the dissipation in the system, another is used to transfer the state. The control theory's stability ensures the system can be transferred to the target state in high probability, and the coefficients in control laws leads very fast convergence. The role of eliminating the dissipation plays the suppression of decoherence effect. Numerical simulation results show that under the realistic implementation conditions, the transfer probability and fidelity can be increased up to 98.79% and 98.97%, respectively. This is the first result directly applicable to a DQD system's state transferring using the Lyapunov control method. We also give specific experimental realization scheme. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.2627;Characterization of multipartite entanglement; Nengkun Yu,  Youming Qiao,  Xiaoming Sun;  In this paper, we provide a characterization of multipartite entanglement in terms of equivalence classes of states under local unitary transformation (LU) by demonstrating a simple method to construct all homogenous polynomials that are invariant under local unitary group(LUIPs) for any fixed degree. We give an upper bound on the degree of the LUIP such that the ring of LUIPs can be generated by LUIPs with degree lower than the bound. Our characterization can directly generate an algorithm whose output is a generating set of LUIPs. By employing the concept of LUIPs, we prove that multipartite entanglement is additive in the sense that two multipartite states are LU equivalent if and only if $n$-copies of these two states are LU equivalent for some $n$. The method for studying LU equivalence is also used to classify the different types of multipartite mixed entanglement according to equivalence classes of states under stochastic local operations and classical communication (SLOCC), where the pure states case was previously studied by Gour and Wallach using another approach. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.2647;The Unreasonable Success of Quantum Probability I: Quantum Measurements  as Uniform Fluctuations; Diederik Aerts,  Massimiliano Sassoli de Bianchi;  We introduce a 'uniform tension-reduction' (UTR) model, which allows to represent the probabilities associated with an arbitrary measurement situation and use it to explain the emergence of quantum probabilities (the Born rule) as 'uniform' fluctuations on this measurement situation. The model exploits the geometry of simplexes to represent the states, in a way that the measurement probabilities can be derived as the 'Lebesgue measure' of suitably defined convex subregions of the simplexes. We consider a very simple and evocative physical realization of the abstract model, using a material point particle which is acted upon by elastic membranes, which by breaking and collapsing produce the different possible outcomes. This easy to visualize mechanical realization allows one to gain considerable insight into the possible hidden structure of an arbitrary measurement process. We also show that the UTR-model can be further generalized into a 'general tension-reduction' (GTR) model, describing conditions of lack of knowledge generated by 'non-uniform' fluctuations. In this ampler framework, particularly suitable to describe experiments in cognitive science, we define and motivate a notion of 'universal measurement', describing the most general possible condition of lack of knowledge in a measurement, emphasizing that the uniform fluctuations characterizing quantum measurements can also be understood as an average over all possible forms of non-uniform fluctuations which can be actualized in a measurement context. This means that the Born rule of quantum mechanics can be understood as a first order approximation of a more general non-uniform theory, thus explaining part of the great success of quantum probability in the description of different domains of reality. This is the first part of a two-part article. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.2650;The Unreasonable Success of Quantum Probability II: Quantum Measurements  as Universal Measurements; Diederik Aerts,  Massimiliano Sassoli de Bianchi;  In the first part of this two-part article, we have introduced and analyzed a multidimensional model, called the 'general tension-reduction' (GTR) model, able to describe general quantum-like measurements with an arbitrary number of outcomes, and we have used it as a general theoretical framework to study the most general possible condition of lack of knowledge in a measurement, so defining what we have called a 'universal measurement'. In this second part, we present the formal proof that universal measurements, which are averages over all possible forms of fluctuations, produce the same probabilities as measurements characterized by 'uniform' fluctuations on the measurement situation. Since quantum probabilities can be shown to arise from the presence of such uniform fluctuations, we have proven that they can be interpreted as the probabilities of a first-order non-classical theory, describing situations in which the experimenter lacks complete knowledge about the nature of the interaction between the measuring apparatus and the entity under investigation. This same explanation can be applied -- mutatis mutandis -- to the case of cognitive measurements, made by human subjects on conceptual entities, or in decision processes, although it is not necessarily the case that the structure of the set of states would be in this case strictly Hilbertian. We also show that universal measurements correspond to maximally 'robust' descriptions of indeterministic reproducible experiments, and since quantum measurements can also be shown to be maximally robust, this adds plausibility to their interpretation as universal measurements, and provides a further element of explanation for the great success of the quantum statistics in the description of a large class of phenomena. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)"

Two possible models are investigated, the direct interaction of the electromagnetic field with the reservoir and indirect interaction via an intermediate oscillator imitating the atom.

We study in detail the sensitivity of the estimation on the decoherence rate $\gamma$ and the two-qubit interaction strength $v$. In particular, the dynamics of quantum Fisher information are employed as a measure to quantify the precision of the estimations. We find that the quantum Fisher information with respect to the decoherence rate scales like $t^2/[\exp(\gamma t)-1]$ and $\exp(-2\gamma t)$ in the unitary limit and the completely decoherent limit, respectively. When we estimate the interaction strength $v$, the quantum Fisher information shows oscillation behavior in term of time. In addition, our results provide further evidence that the entanglement of the input state may not enhance quantum metrology. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.2896;A Bose-Einstein Condensate with $\mathcal{PT}$-Symmetric Double-Delta  Function Loss and Gain in a Harmonic Trap: A Test of Rigorous Estimates; Daniel Haag,  Holger Cartarius,  Günter Wunner;"  We consider the linear and nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation for a Bose-Einstein condensate in a harmonic trap with $\cal {PT}$-symmetric double-delta function loss and gain terms. We verify that the conditions for the applicability of a recent proposition by Mityagin and Siegl on singular perturbations of harmonic oscillator type self-adjoint operators are fulfilled. In both the linear and nonlinear case we calculate numerically the shifts of the unperturbed levels with quantum numbers $n$ of up to 89 in dependence on the strength of the non-Hermiticity and compare with rigorous estimates derived by those authors. We confirm that the predicted $1/n^{1/2}$ estimate provides a valid upper bound on the the shrink rate of the numerical eigenvalues. Moreover, we find that a more recent estimate of $\log(n)/n^{3/2}$ is in excellent agreement with the numerical results. With nonlinearity the shrink rates are found to be smaller than without nonlinearity, and the rigorous estimates, derived only for the linear case, are no longer applicable.

Lidar,  Matthias Troyer;  The development of small-scale digital and analog quantum devices raises the question of how to fairly assess and compare the computational power of classical and quantum devices, and of how to detect quantum speedup. Here we show how to define and measure quantum speedup in various scenarios, and how to avoid pitfalls that might mask or fake quantum speedup. We illustrate our discussion with data from a randomized benchmark test on a D-Wave Two device with up to 503 qubits. Comparing the performance of the device on random spin glass instances with limited precision to simulated classical and quantum annealers, we find no evidence of quantum speedup when the entire data set is considered, and obtain inconclusive results when comparing subsets of instances on an instance-by-instance basis. Our results for one particular benchmark do not rule out the possibility of speedup for other classes of problems and illustrate that quantum speedup is elusive and can depend on the question posed. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

As a follow-up to the authors' early journal publication [J. Comput. System Sci., vol.75, pp.255-269, 2009], we further investigate the quantum nature of interactions between provers and verifiers by studying how various restrictions on quantum interactive proof systems affect the language recognition power of the proof systems. In particular, we examine three intriguing restrictions that (i) provers always behave in a classical fashion, (ii) verifiers always reveal to provers the information on next moves, and (iii) the number of interactions between provers and verifiers is bounded. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Computational Complexity (cs.CC); Formal Languages and Automata Theory (cs.FL)"

This remarkable feature is in general difficult to characterize and the known definitions are hard to measure. Besides the efforts dedicated to solve this problem, the question of which is the best approach remains open. In this work, we study the Global Quantum Discord, GQD, as a bipartite and multipartite measure. We also check the limits of this definitions and present an experimental scheme to determine the maximum of the GQD via the measurements of the system's excitations, during the time evolution of the present system. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Optics (physics.optics)"

Harris;  Cavity optomechanics offers powerful methods for controlling optical fields and mechanical motion. A number of proposals have predicted that this control can be extended considerably in devices where multiple cavity modes couple to each other via the motion of a single mechanical oscillator. Here we study the dynamical properties of such a multimode optomechanical device, in which the coupling between cavity modes results from mechanically-induced avoided crossings in the cavity's spectrum. Near the avoided crossings we find that the optical spring shows distinct features that arise from the interaction between cavity modes. Precisely at an avoided crossing, we show that the particular form of the optical spring provides a classical analog of a quantum-nondemolition measurement of the intracavity photon number. The mechanical oscillator's Brownian motion, an important source of noise in these measurements, is minimized by operating the device at cryogenic temperature (500 mK). ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Optics (physics.optics)"

Such proofs use contexts of observables whose product is $I$ or $-I$; we call them constraints. In the first approach, one starts with a fixed set of constraints and methods of linear algebra are used to produce subsets that are generalized parity proofs. Coding theory methods are used for enumeration of the proofs by size. In the second approach, one starts with the combinatorial structure of the set of constraints and one looks for ways to suitably populate this structure with observables. As well, we are able to show that many combinatorial structures can not produce parity proofs. ";Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00033;Parallel repetition for entangled k-player games via fast quantum search; Kai-Min Chung,  Xiaodi Wu,  Henry Yuen;"  We present two parallel repetition theorems for the entangled value of multi-player, one-round free games (games where the inputs come from a product distribution). Our first theorem shows that for a $k$-player free game $G$ with entangled value $\mathrm{val}^*(G) = 1 - \epsilon$, the $n$-fold repetition of $G$ has entangled value $\mathrm{val}^*(G^{\otimes n})$ at most $(1 - \epsilon^{3/2})^{\Omega(n/sk^4)}$, where $s$ is the answer length of any player. In contrast, the best known parallel repetition theorem for the classical value of two-player free games is $\mathrm{val}(G^{\otimes n}) \leq (1 - \epsilon^2)^{\Omega(n/s)}$, due to Barak, et al. (RANDOM 2009). This suggests the possibility of a separation between the behavior of entangled and classical free games under parallel repetition. Our second theorem handles the broader class of free games $G$ where the players can output (possibly entangled) quantum states. For such games, the repeated entangled value is upper bounded by $(1 - \epsilon^2)^{\Omega(n/sk^2)}$. We also show that the dependence of the exponent on $k$ is necessary: we exhibit a $k$-player free game $G$ and $n \geq 1$ such that $\mathrm{val}^*(G^{\otimes n}) \geq \mathrm{val}^*(G)^{n/k}$. Our analysis exploits the novel connection between communication protocols and quantum parallel repetition, first explored by Chailloux and Scarpa (ICALP 2014). We demonstrate that better communication protocols yield better parallel repetition theorems: our first theorem crucially uses a quantum search protocol by Aaronson and Ambainis, which gives a quadratic speed-up for distributed search problems. Finally, our results apply to a broader class of games than were previously considered before; in particular, we obtain the first parallel repetition theorem for entangled games involving more than two players, and for games involving quantum outputs.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00068;Comparison of a quantum error correction threshold for exact and  approximate errors; Mauricio Gutiérrez,  Kenneth R. Brown;  Classical simulations of noisy stabilizer circuits are often used to estimate the threshold of a quantum error-correcting code. Physical noise sources are efficiently approximated by random insertions of Pauli operators. For a single qubit, more accurate approximations that still allow for efficient simulation can be obtained by including Clifford operators and Pauli operators conditional on measurement in the noise model. We examine the feasibility of employing these expanded error approximations to obtain better threshold estimates. We calculate the level-1 pseudothreshold for the Steane [[7,1,3]] code for amplitude damping and dephasing along a non-Clifford axis. The expanded channels estimate the actual channel action more accurately than the Pauli channels before error correction. However, after error correction, the Pauli twirling approximation yields very accurate estimates of the performance of quantum error-correcting protocols in the presence of the actual noise channel. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

Park,  Guanru Feng,  Robabeh Rahimi,  Stephane Labruyere,  Taiki Shibata,  Shigeaki Nakazawa,  Kazunobu Sato,  Takeji Takui,  Raymond Laflamme,  Jonathan Baugh;  The ability to perform quantum error correction is a significant hurdle for scalable quantum information processing. A key requirement for multiple-round quantum error correction is the ability to dynamically extract entropy from ancilla qubits. Heat-bath algorithmic cooling is a method that uses quantum logic operations to move entropy from one subsystem to another, and permits cooling of a spin qubit below the closed system (Shannon) bound. Gamma-irradiated, $^{13}$C-labeled malonic acid provides up to 5 spin qubits: 1 spin-half electron and 4 spin-half nuclei. The nuclei are strongly hyperfine coupled to the electron and can be controlled either by exploiting the anisotropic part of the hyperfine interaction or by using pulsed electron-nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) techniques. The electron connects the nuclei to a heat-bath with a much colder effective temperature determined by the electron's thermal spin polarization. By accurately determining the full spin Hamiltonian and performing realistic algorithmic simulations, we show that an experimental demonstration of heat-bath algorithmic cooling beyond the Shannon bound is feasible in both 3-qubit and 5-qubit variants of this spin system. Similar techniques could be useful for polarizing nuclei in molecular or crystalline systems that allow for non-equilibrium optical polarization of the electron spin. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

The scheme is employing appropriate combinations of uncorrelated probe atoms and Greenburgur-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) type correlated probe atoms to estimate its frequency. The estimation value of frequency is obtained through the Bayesian analysis of the final measurement outcomes. The proposed scheme allows us to obtain better precision than the scheme without quantum correlation and it also prevents us from ambiguity in the frequency estimation procedure with GHZ correlations only. We show that the scheme can beat the shot-noise limit and, in addition, it is found that there is the trade-off relation between the precision of the frequency estimation and the decoherence rate in the atomic states. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

The additional symmetries that emerge in the non-interacting limit and in the unitary limit of an infinitely strong contact interaction are sufficient to algebraically solve for the spectrum and degeneracy in terms of the one-particle observables. Symmetry also determines the degree to which the algebraic expressions for energy level shifts by weak interactions or nearly-unitary interactions are universal, i.e.\ independent of trap shape and details of the interaction. Identical fermions and bosons with and without spin are considered.

The single-radical-triplet system (SRTS) is considered here for single-qubit quantum gate operations while double-radical-triplet system (DRTS) for two-qubit operations. The environment effects taken into account include the spin-lattice relaxation of the triplet exciton and radical spin-$\frac{1}{2}$, the inter-system crossing process that induces the transition from singlet excited state to the triplet ground state, and the rather slow relaxation process from the triplet ground state back down to the singlet ground state. These calculations shown that the line shape broadening is strongly related to the exchange interaction between triplet and exciton, which can be understood as a spontaneous magnetic field created by the triplet renormalises the original spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ electron spin resonance spectra. This work will provide key information about the spin dynamics for building optically-controlled molecular quantum gate out of radical-bearing molecules.

Our proposal is based on the weak coupling limit of the two outermost quantum dots to the data bus. First show that the data bus has an energy gap between the ground and first-excited states in the single-particle case induced by the impurity in the single particle case. By connecting two quantum dots to two sites of the data bus, the system can accomplish a high-fidelity and long-distance quantum state transfer. Numerical simulations were performed for a finite system; the results show that the numerical and analytical results of the effective coupling strength agree well with each other. Moreover, we study the robustness of this quantum communication protocol in the presence of disorder in the couplings between the nearest-neighbor quantum dots. We find that the gap of the system plays an important role in robust quantum state transfer. ";Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

By analytically solving the scattering problem of two typical models, which display standard Fano resonances in the absence of non-Hermitian terms, we find that the PT-symmetric imaginary potentials can lead to some pronounced effects on transport properties of our systems, including changes from the perfect reflection to perfect transmission, and rich behaviors for the absence or existence of the prefect reflection at one and two resonant frequencies. Our study can help us to understand the interplay between the Fano resonance and PT symmetry in non-Hermitian discrete systems, which may be realizable in optical waveguide experiments. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

In this work, however, we focus on investigating the information-theoretic upper bounds of sample complexity - how many training samples are sufficient to predict the future behaviour of an unknown target function. This kind of problem is, arguably, one of the most fundamental problems in statistical learning theory and the bounds for practical settings can be completely characterised by a simple measure of complexity. Our main result in the paper is that, for learning an unknown quantum measurement, the upper bound, given by the fat-shattering dimension, is linearly proportional to the dimension of the underlying Hilbert space. Learning an unknown quantum state becomes a dual problem to ours, and as a byproduct, we can recover Aaronson's famous result [Proc. R. Soc. A 463:3089-3144 (2007)] solely using a classical machine learning technique. In addition, other famous complexity measures like covering numbers and Rademacher complexities are derived explicitly. We are able to connect measures of sample complexity with various areas in quantum information science, e.g. quantum state/measurement tomography, quantum state discrimination and quantum random access codes, which may be of independent interest. Lastly, with the assistance of general Bloch-sphere representation, we show that learning quantum measurements/states can be mathematically formulated as a neural network. Consequently, classical ML algorithms can be applied to efficiently accomplish the two quantum learning tasks. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Learning (cs.LG); Machine Learning (stat.ML)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00693;Do Spins Have Directions?; Diederik Aerts,  Massimiliano Sassoli de Bianchi;  The standard Bloch sphere representation was recently generalized to the 'extended Bloch representation' describing not only systems of arbitrary dimension, but also their measurements. This model solves the measurement problem and is based on the 'hidden-measurement interpretation', according to which the Born rule results from our lack of knowledge about the interaction between measuring apparatus and the measured entity. We present here the extended Bloch model and use it to investigate the nature of quantum spin and its relation to our Euclidean space. We show that spin eigenstates cannot generally be associated with directions in the Euclidean space, but only with generalized directions in the Blochean space, which generally is a space of higher dimension. Hence, spin entities have to be considered as genuine non-spatial entities. We also show, however, that specific vectors can be identified in the Blochean theater that are isomorphic to the Euclidean space directions, and therefore representative of them, and that spin eigenstates always have a predetermined orientation with respect to them. We use the details of our results to put forward a new view of realism, that we call 'multiplex realism', providing a specific framework with which to interpret the human observations and understanding of the component parts of the world. Elements of reality can be represented in different theaters, one being our customary Euclidean space, and another one the quantum realm, revealed to us through our sophisticated experiments, whose elements of reality, in the quantum jargon, are the eigenvalues and eigenstates. Our understanding of the component parts of the world can then be guided by looking for the possible connections, in the form of partial morphisms, between the different representations, which is precisely what we do in this article with regard to spin entities. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

The set ${\cal S}_1$ has two kinds of faces, induced and non-induced. An induced face, $F$, has the form $F=\Gamma(F_V)$, where $V$ is a subspace of ${\cal H}$, $F_V$ is the set of $\rho\in{\cal S}_1$ whose range is contained in $V$, and $\Gamma$ is a partial transposition operator. Such $F$ is a maximal face if and only if $V$ is a hyperplane. We give a simple formula for the dimension of any induced maximal face. We also prove that the maximum dimension of induced maximal faces is equal to $d(d-2)$ where $d$ is the dimension of ${\cal H}$. The equality $\dim\Gamma(F_V)=d(d-2)$ holds if and only if $V^\perp$ is spanned by a genuinely entangled vector. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

Here we consider the tripartite hybrid system as a pair of non interacting two qutrits initially prepared in bound entangled states and one auxiliary qubit. The auxiliary qubit interacts with any one of the qutrit of the pair through DM interaction. It has been found that the DM interaction free the bound entangled states as time advances. In the present work we consider two types of bound entangled states investigated by Horodecki. Further we find that the frequency of free entanglement conversion is same in both the states. We also investigate the phenomenon of entanglement and distillability sudden death and their possibilities. Here the realignment criteria and negativity have been used for detection and quantification of entanglement. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00944;Toward a thermo-hydrodynamic like description of Schrodinger equation  via the Madelung formulation and Fisher information; Eyal Heifetz,  Eliahu Cohen;  We revisit the analogy suggested by Madelung between a non-relativistic time-dependent quantum particle, to a fluid system which is pseudo-barotropic, irrotational and inviscid. We first discuss the hydrodynamical properties of the Madelung description in general, and extract a pressure like term from the Bohm potential. We show that the existence of a pressure gradient force in the fluid description does not violate Ehrenfest's theorem since its expectation value is zero. We also point out that incompressibility of the fluid implies conservation of density along a fluid parcel trajectory and in 1D this immediately results in the non-spreading property of wave packets, as the sum of Bohm potential and an exterior potential must be either constant or linear in space. Next we relate to the hydrodynamic description a thermodynamic counterpart, taking the classical behavior of an adiabatic barotopric flow as a reference. We show that while the Bohm potential is not a positive definite quantity, as is expected from internal energy, its expectation value is proportional to the Fisher information whose integrand is positive definite. Moreover, this integrand is exactly equal to half of the square of the imaginary part of the momentum, as the integrand of the kinetic energy is equal to half of the square of the real part of the momentum. This suggests a relation between the Fisher information and the thermodynamic like internal energy of the Madelung fluid. Furthermore, it provides a physical linkage between the inverse of the Fisher information and the measure of disorder in quantum systems - in spontaneous adiabatic gas expansion the amount of disorder increases while the internal energy decreases. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)"

Darabad,  Jonathan Baugh,  Raymond Laflamme;  Application of multiple rounds of Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is an essential milestone towards the construction of scalable quantum information processing devices. However, experimental realizations of it are still in their infancy. The requirements for multiple round QEC are high control fidelity and the ability to extract entropy from ancilla qubits. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) based quantum devices have demonstrated high control fidelity with up to 12 qubits. On the other hand, the major challenge in the NMR QEC experiment is to efficiently supply ancilla qubits in highly pure states at the beginning of each round of QEC. Purification of qubits in NMR, or in other ensemble based quantum systems can be accomplished through Heat Bath Algorithmic Cooling (HBAC). It is an efficient method for extracting entropy from qubits that interact with a heat bath, allowing cooling below the bath temperature. For practical HBAC, coupled electron-nuclear spin systems are more promising than conventional NMR quantum processors, since electron spin polarization is about $10^3$ times greater than that of a proton under the same experimental conditions. We provide an overview on both theoretical and experimental aspects of HBAC focusing on spin and magnetic resonance based systems, and discuss the prospects of exploiting electron-nuclear coupled systems for the realization of HBAC and multiple round QEC. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

Lukin;  We propose and analyze heralded quantum gates between qubits in optical cavities. They employ an auxiliary qubit to report if a successful gate occurred. In this manner, the errors, which would have corrupted a deterministic gate, are converted into a non-unity probability of success: once successful the gate has a much higher fidelity than a similar deterministic gate. Specifically, we describe that a heralded , near-deterministic controlled phase gate (CZ-gate) with the conditional error arbitrarily close to zero and the success probability that approaches unity as the cooperativity of the system, C, becomes large. Furthermore, we describe an extension to near-deterministic N- qubit Toffoli gate with a favorable error scaling. These gates can be directly employed in quantum repeater networks to facilitate near-ideal entanglement swapping, thus greatly speeding up the entanglement distribution. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00970;A delayed choice quantum eraser explained by the transactional  interpretation of quantum mechanics; H. Fearn;"  This paper explains the delayed choice quantum eraser of Kim et al. in terms of the transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics by John Cramer. It is kept deliberately mathematically simple to help explain the transactional technique. The emphasis is on a clear understanding of how the instantaneous ""collapse"" of the wave function due to a measurement at a specific time and place may be reinterpreted as a gradual collapse over the entire path of the photon and over the entire transit time from slit to detector. This is made possible by the use of a retarded offer wave, which is thought to travel from the slits (or rather the small region within the parametric crystal where down-conversion takes place) to the detector and an advanced counter wave traveling backward in time from the detector to the slits. The point here is to make clear how simple the Cramer transactional picture is and how much more intuitive the collapse of the wave function becomes if viewed in this way. Also any confusion about possible retro-causal signaling is put to rest. A delayed choice quantum eraser does not require any sort of backward in time communication. This paper makes the point that it is preferable to use the Transactional Interpretation (TI) over the usual Copenhagen Interpretation (CI) for a more intuitive understanding of the quantum eraser delayed choice experiment. Both methods give exactly the same end results and can be used interchangeably. ";Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

We show that this scenario could be realised with a cascaded superconducting cavity-qubit system in the strong dispersive regime in a setup similar to recent experiments. In the presence of dissipation, we find that an effective Hartree-type decoupling with a Fokker-Planck equation yields a good approximation. We find that the stationary state is approximately a squeezed vacuum, which is enhanced by the $Q$-factor of the cavity but conserved by the interaction. The qubit non-linearity, therefore, does not significantly influence the highly squeezed intracavity microwave field but, for a range of realistic parameters, enables characterisation of itinerant squeezed fields. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

It was recently derived in terms of spectrum broadcast structures for small objects embedded in noisy photon-like environments. However, two fundamental problems have arisen: a description of objective motion and applicability to other types of environments. Here we derive an example of objective states of motion in quantum mechanics by showing a formation of dynamical spectrum broadcast structures in the celebrated, realistic model of decoherence---Quantum Brownian Motion. We do it for realistic, thermal environments and show their noise-robustness. This opens a potentially new method of studying quantum-to-classical transition. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

Olson,  Evan J. Rabeaux,  Jonathan P. Dowling,  S. Jay Olson,  Peter P. Rohde;  Quantum number-path entanglement is a resource for super-sensitive quantum metrology and in particular provides for sub-shotnoise or even Heisenberg-limited sensitivity. However, such number-path entanglement has thought to have been resource intensive to create in the first place --- typically requiring either very strong nonlinearities, or nondeterministic preparation schemes with feed-forward, which are difficult to implement. Very recently, arising from the study of quantum random walks with multi-photon walkers, as well as the study of the computational complexity of passive linear optical interferometers fed with single-photon inputs, it has been shown that such passive linear optical devices generate a superexponentially large amount of number-path entanglement. A logical question to ask is whether this entanglement may be exploited for quantum metrology. We answer that question here in the affirmative by showing that a simple, passive, linear-optical interferometer --- fed with only uncorrelated, single-photon inputs, coupled with simple, single-mode, disjoint photodetection --- is capable of significantly beating the shotnoise limit. Our result implies a pathway forward to practical quantum metrology with readily available technology. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

Also, we investigate the dynamics of the entanglement using the lower bound to the concurrence. It is found that while the entanglement decreases monotonically for Pauli-Z noise, it decays suddenly for other three noises. Moreover, by studying the time evolution of entanglement of various maximally entangled four-qubit states, we indicate that the four-qubit W state is more robust under same-axis Pauli channels. Furthermore, three-qubit W state preserves more entanglement with respect to the four-qubit W state, except for the Pauli-Z noise. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01287;Can a Dove prism change the past of a single photon?; Miguel A. Alonso,  Andrew N. Jordan;"  We reexamine the thought experiment and real experiment of Vaidman et al., by placing Dove prisms in the nested Mach-Zehnder interferometer arms. In those previous works, the criterion of whether a single photon was present, or not, was the presence of a ""weak trace"", indicating the presence of a nonzero weak value. This was verified by slightly varying the mirror angle at a given frequency, which was then detected on a position sensitive detector at the oscillation frequency. We show the presence of the Dove prisms gives identical weak values everywhere to the previous configuration because the prisms change neither the path difference, nor the mode profile in the aligned case. Nevertheless, the same slight variations of the interferometer mirrors now give a signal at the first mirror of the nested interferometer. We can interpret this result as a misaligned optical interferometer, whose detailed response depends on the stability of the elements, or as the detector coupling to a nonzero effective weak value.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01298;Magic State Distillation and Gate Compilation in Quantum Algorithms for  Quantum Chemistry; Colin J. Trout,  Kenneth R. Brown;  Quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry map the dynamics of electrons in a molecule to the dynamics of a coupled spin system. To reach chemical accuracy for interesting molecules, a large number of quantum gates must be applied which implies the need for quantum error correction and fault-tolerant quantum computation. Arbitrary fault-tolerant operations can be constructed from a small, universal set of fault-tolerant operations by gate compilation. Quantum chemistry algorithms are compiled by decomposing the dynamics of the coupled spin-system using a Trotter formula, synthesizing the decomposed dynamics using Clifford operations and single-qubit rotations, and finally approximating the single-qubit rotations by a sequence of fault-tolerant single-qubit gates. Certain fault-tolerant gates rely on the preparation of specific single-qubit states referred to as magic states. As a result, gate compilation and magic state distillation are critical for solving quantum chemistry problems on a quantum computer. We review recent progress that has improved the efficiency of gate compilation and magic state distillation by orders of magnitude. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01339;Interferometry versus projective measurement of anyons; Michael H. Freedman,  Claire I. Levaillant;  The distinct methods for measuring topological charge in a non-abelian anyonic system have been discussed in the literature: projective measurement of a single point-like quasiparticle and interferometric measurement of the total topological charge of a group of quasiparticles. Projective measurement by definition is only applied near a point and will project to a topological charge sector near that point. Thus, if it is to be applied to a \emph{group} of anyons to project to a \emph{total} charge, then the anyons must first be fused one by one to obtain a single anyon carrying the collective charge. We show that interferometric measurement is strictly stronger: Any protocol involving projective measurement can be simulated at low overhead by another protocol involving only interferometric measurement. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Quantum Algebra (math.QA)"

However, this is at cost of reducing their detection bandwidth, which origins from the propagation phase delay of the light. The ""white-light-cavity"" idea, first proposed by Wicht et al. [Optics Communications 134, 431 (1997)], is to circumvent this limitation by introducing anomalous dispersion, using double-pumped gain medium, to compensate for such phase delay. In this article, starting from the Hamiltonian of atom-light interaction, we apply the input-output formalism to evaluate the quantum noise of the system. We find that apart from the additional noise associated with the parametric amplification process noticed by others, the stability condition for the entire system poses an additional constraint. Through surveying the parameter regimes where the gain medium remains stable (not lasing) and stationary, we find that there is no net enhancement of the shot-noise limited sensitivity. Therefore, other gain mediums or different parameter regimes shall be explored for realizing the white light cavity. ";"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Optics (physics.optics)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01406;A quantum mechanical bound for CHSH-type Bell inequalities; Michael Epping,  Hermann Kampermann,  Dagmar Bruß;  Many typical Bell experiments can be described as follows. A source repeatedly distributes particles among two spacelike separated observers. Each of them makes a measurement, using an observable randomly chosen out of several possible ones, leading to one of two possible outcomes. After collecting a sufficient amount of data one calculates the value of a so-called Bell expression. An important question in this context is whether the result is compatible with bounds based on the assumptions of locality, realism and freedom of choice. Here we are interested in bounds on the obtained value derived from quantum theory, so-called Tsirelson bounds. We describe a simple Tsirelson bound, which is based on a singular value decomposition. This mathematical result leads to some physical insights. In particular the optimal observables can be obtained. Furthermore statements about the dimension of the underlying Hilbert space are possible. Finally, Bell inequalities can be modified to match rotated measurement settings, e.g. if the two parties do not share a common reference frame. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

We faithfully demonstrate for the first time such generality by experimentally showing genuine four-partite EPR steering and applications to universal one-way quantum computing. Our formalism provides a new insight into the intermediate type of genuine multipartite Bell non-locality and potential applications to quantum of untrusted measurement devices. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

Here, we propose a scheme of near-Earth orbit satellite-based quantum clock synchronization with atmospheric dispersion cancellation by taking into account the spacetime background of the Earth. Two frequency entangled pulses are employed to synchronize two clocks, one at a ground station and the other at a satellite. The time discrepancy of the two clocks is introduced into the pulses by moving mirrors and is extracted by measuring the coincidence rate of the pulses in the interferometer. We find that the pulses are distorted due to effects of gravity when they propagate between the Earth and the satellite, resulting in remarkably affected coincidence rates. We also find that the precision of the clock synchronization is sensitive to the source parameters and the altitude of the satellite. The scheme provides a solution for satellite-based quantum clock synchronization with high precision, which can be realized, in principle, with current technology. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Optics (physics.optics)"

By adopting a rather strict definition of correctness - guaranteeing that honest players obtain their correct outcomes only - we can show that every strictly correct quantum protocol implementing a non-trivial classical primitive necessarily leaks information to a dishonest player. This extends known impossibility results to all non-trivial primitives. We provide a framework for quantifying this leakage and argue that leakage is a good measure for the privacy provided to the players by a given protocol. Our framework also covers the case where the two players are helped by a trusted third party. We show that despite the help of a trusted third party, the players cannot amplify the cryptographic power of any primitive. All our results hold even against quantum honest-but-curious adversaries who honestly follow the protocol but purify their actions and apply a different measurement at the end of the protocol. As concrete examples, we establish lower bounds on the leakage of standard universal two-party primitives such as oblivious transfer. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)"

Hamiltonian simulation via a quantum walk has optimal dependence on the sparsity at the expense of poor scaling in the allowed error. In contrast, an approach based on fractional-query simulation provides optimal scaling in the error at the expense of poor scaling in the sparsity. Here we combine the two approaches, achieving the best features of both. By implementing a linear combination of quantum walk steps with coefficients given by Bessel functions, our algorithm's complexity (as measured by the number of queries and 2-qubit gates) is logarithmic in the inverse error, and nearly linear in the product $\tau$ of the evolution time, the sparsity, and the magnitude of the largest entry of the Hamiltonian. Our dependence on the error is optimal, and we prove a new lower bound showing that no algorithm can have sublinear dependence on $\tau$. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

We investigate entanglement detection using sets of MUMs and derived separability criteria for $d$-dimensional multipartite systems, and arbitrary high-dimensional bipartitie and multipartite systems. These criteria provide experimental implementation in detecting entanglement of unknown quantum states. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

We consider states in such a theory, that describe two entangled particles localized in disjoint regions of space. We show that in such a state, to leading order, R\'{e}nyi entropies of spatial regions, containing only one of the particles are same as their quantum mechanical counterparts, after subtraction of vacuum contribution. Subleading corrections depend on overlap of wave functions. These results suggest that Von Neumann entropy of a spatial region, after subtraction of vacuum contribution, can serve as a measure of entanglement of indistinguishable particles in pure states. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)"

Remarkably, when $k=2,3$, the set reduces to two well known state-independent contextuality (SIC) sets: the Yu-Oh set and the Bengtsson-Blanchfield-Cabello set. Based on the Ramanathan-Horodecki criterion and the violation of a noncontextuality inequality, we have proven that the sets with $k=3m$ and $k=4$ are SIC, while the set with $k=5$ is not. Our generalized set of rays will theoretically enrich the study of SIC proof, and experimentally stimulate the novel application to quantum information processing. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

Albeit BOs are deeply rooted into the very foundations of quantum mechanics, all experimental observations of this phenomenon so far have only contemplated dynamics of one or two particles initially prepared in separable local states, which is well described by classical wave physics. Evidently, a more general description of genuinely quantum BOs will be achieved upon excitation of a Bloch-oscillator lattice system by nonlocal states, that is, containing correlations in contradiction with local realism. Here we report the first experimental observation of BOs of two-particle Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen states (EPR), whose associated N-particle wave functions are nonlocal by nature. The time evolution of two-photon EPR states in Bloch-oscillators, whether symmetric, antisymmetric or partially symmetric, reveals unexpected transitions from particle antibunching to bunching. Consequently, the initial state can be tailored to produce spatial correlations akin to bosons, fermions or anyons. These results pave the way for a wider class of photonic quantum simulators. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other); Optics (physics.optics)"

Frohlich,  M. B. Ward,  A. J. Shields;  Since the introduction of the decoy-state technique, phase-randomised weak coherent light pulses have been the key to increase the practicality of quantum-based communications. Their ultra-fast generation was accomplished via compact gain-switched (GS) lasers, leading to high key rates in quantum key distribution (QKD). Recently, the question arose of whether the same laser could be employed to achieve high-speed measurement-device-independent-QKD, a scheme that promises long-haul quantum communications immune to all detector attacks. For that, a challenging highvisibility interference between independent picosecond optical pulses is required. Here, we answer the above question in the affirmative by demonstrating high-visibility interference from two independent GS lasers triggered at 1GHz. The result is obtained through a careful characterization of the laser frequency chirp and time jitter. By relating these quantities to the interference visibility, we obtain a parameter-free verification of the experimental data and a numerical simulation of the achievable key rates. These findings are beneficial to other applications making use of GS lasers, including random number generation and standard QKD. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

Possible physical implementations of many processes in quantum information theory involve systems of identical particles, whence comprehension of the dynamics of entanglement induced by decoherence processes in identical-particle open systems becomes relevant. Here we study the effects, and concomitant entanglement evolution, arising from the interaction between a system of two identical fermions and the environment, for two paradigmatic quantum channels. New entanglement measures are introduced to quantify the entanglement between the different parties, and a study of the dynamics of entanglement for some particular examples is carried out. Our analysis, which includes also the evolution of an entanglement indicator based on an entropic criteria, offers new insights into the dynamics of entanglement in open systems of identical particles, involving the emergence of multipartite genuine entanglement. The results improve our understanding of the phenomenon of decoherence and will provide new strategies to control it. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

This process is treated as qubit state-transfer through a fermionic bath. We show that dynamical modulation of the boundary-qubits levels can ensure state transfer with the best tradeoff of speed and fidelity. This is achievable by dynamically optimizing the transmission spectrum of the channel. The resulting optimal control is robust against both static and fluctuating noise in the channel's spin-spin couplings. It may also facilitate transfer in the presence of diagonal disorder (on site energy noise) in the channel. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

Our main result is a convergence theorem whereby we demonstrate when and how a set of consecutive weak measurements converges to a strong measurement. Second, we show that for a small set of consecutive weak measurements, long before their convergence, one can separate close states without causing their collapse. We thus demonstrate a tradeoff between the success probability and the bias of the original vector towards collapse. Next we use post-selection within the Two-State-Vector Formalism and present the non-linear expansion of the expectation value of the measurement device's pointer to distinguish between two predetermined close vectors. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

We theoretically investigate the robustness of opto(electro)-mechanical quan- tum memories against the noise of the control laser. By solving the Langevin equations and using the covariance matrix formalism in the presence of laser noise, the storing fidelity of Gaussian states is obtained. It is shown that, the destructive effect of phase noise is more significant in higher values of coupling laser amplitude and optomechanical coupling strength G. However, by further increasing coupling coefficient, the interaction time between photons and phonons decreases below the coherence time of laser frequency noise and the destructive effect of laser phase noise on the storing fidelity drops as well. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

In this work, we explore non-Markovianity through the breakdown of monotonicity of a metrological figure of merit, called the quantum interferometric power, which is based on the minimal quantum Fisher information obtained by local unitary evolution of one part of the system, and can be interpreted as a quantifier of quantum correlations beyond entanglement. We investigate our proposed non-Markovianity indicator in two relevant examples. First, we consider the action of a single-party dephasing channel on a maximally entangled two-qubit state, by applying the Jamio{\l}kowski-Choi isomorphism. We observe that the proposed measure is consistent with established non-Markovianity quantifiers defined using other approaches based on dynamical divisibility, distinguishability, and breakdown of monotonicity for the quantum mutual information. Further, we consider the dynamics of two-qubit Werner states, under the action of a local, single-party amplitude damping channel, and observe that the nonmonotonic evolution of the quantum interferometric power is more robust than the corresponding one for entanglement in capturing the backflow of quantum information associated with the non-Markovian process. Implications for the role of non-Markovianity in quantum metrology and possible extensions to continuous variable systems are discussed. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

Desouter-Lecomte;"  Following a recent proposal of L. Wang and D. Babikov, J. Chem. Phys. 137, 064301 (2012), we theoretically illustrate the possibility of using the motional states of a $Cd^+$ ion trapped in a slightly anharmonic potential to simulate the single-particle time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation. The simulated wave packet is discretized on a spatial grid and the grid points are mapped on the ion motional states which define the qubit network. The localization probability at each grid point is obtained from the population in the corresponding motional state. The quantum gate is the elementary evolution operator corresponding to the time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation of the simulated system. The corresponding matrix can be estimated by any numerical algorithm. The radio-frequency field able to drive this unitary transformation among the qubit states of the ion is obtained by multi-target optimal control theory. The ion is assumed to be cooled in the ground motional state and the preliminary step consists in initializing the qubits with the amplitudes of the initial simulated wave packet. The time evolution of the localization probability at the grids points is then obtained by successive applications of the gate and reading out the motional state population. The gate field is always identical for a given simulated potential, only the field preparing the initial wave packet has to be optimized for different simulations. We check the stability of the simulation against decoherence due to fluctuating electric fields in the trap electrodes by applying dissipative Lindblad dynamics. ";Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

Agarwal;  We show the utility of the weak value amplification to observe the quantum interference between two close lying atomic coherent states in a post-selected atomic cat state, produced in a system of $N$ identical two-level atoms weakly interacting with a single photon field. Through the observation of the negative parts of the Wigner distribution of the post-selected atomic cat state, we find that the post-selected atomic cat state becomes more nonclassical when the post-selected polarization state of the single photon field tends toward becoming orthogonal to its pre-selected state. We show that the small phase shift in the post-selected atomic cat state can be amplified via measuring the peak shift of its phase distribution when the post-selected state of the single photon field is nearly orthogonal to its pre-selected state. We find that the amplification factor of 15 [5] can be obtained for a sample of 10 [100] atoms. This effectively provides us with a method to discriminate two close lying states on the Bloch sphere. We discuss possible experimental implementation of the scheme, and conclude with a discussion of the Fisher information. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

On the other hand, irreducible stochastic processes drive states towards some unique fixed point. However, combining both effects is mathematically challenging. The bounds on propagation do not depend on system-size, while the theory of mixing is mostly based on extensive upper-bounds. In a previous paper, a class of local Lindbladian operators on arbitrary lattice was constructed, for which the two effects could be combined. In this paper, we show that for some local dynamics, local observables are propagated inside a much smaller convex subset of the total Banach space. This allows us to show localization for such dynamics. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

Each microtoroidal cavity supports two counter-propagating whispering-gallery modes coupled to single atoms through their evanescent fields. We focus on a pair of atom-microtoroid systems and compute the spectrum of spontaneous emission into the fiber with one atom initially excited. Explicit results are presented for strong-coupling and bad-cavity regimes, where the latter allows the effective atom-atom interaction to be controlled through the atom-cavity coupling and detuning: the atoms exhibit either collective spontaneous emission with no dipole-dipole interaction or a (coherent) dipole-dipole interaction and independent (single-atom) emission. This capacity for switching the character of the interaction is a feature of bi-directional coupling and connects our two-way cascaded system to work on one-dimensional waveguides. Building upon our bad-cavity results, we generalize to many atom-microtoroid systems coupled through an optical fiber. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

The operation scheduling, placement, and qubit routing problems tackled by the quantum physical mapper are highly dependent on one another. More precisely, the scheduling solution affects the quality of the achievable placement solution due to resource pressures that may be created as a result of operation scheduling whereas the operation placement and qubit routing solutions influence the scheduling solution due to resulting distances between predecessor and current operations, which in turn determines routing latencies. The proposed flow for the quantum physical mapper captures these dependencies by applying (i) a loose scheduling step, which transforms an initial quantum data flow graph into one that explicitly captures the no-cloning theorem of the quantum computing and then performs instruction scheduling based on a modified force-directed scheduling approach to minimize the resource contention and quantum circuit latency, (ii) a placement step, which uses timing-driven instruction placement to minimize the approximate routing latencies while making iterative calls to the aforesaid force-directed scheduler to correct scheduling levels of quantum operations as needed, and (iii) a routing step that finds dynamic values of routing latencies for the qubits. In addition to the quantum physical mapper, an approach is presented to determine the single best ULB size for a target quantum circuit by examining the latency of different FT quantum operations mapped onto different ULB sizes and using information about the occurrence frequency of operations on critical paths of the target quantum algorithm to weigh these latencies. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Emerging Technologies (cs.ET)"

Tichy,  Hyang-Tag Lim,  Osung Kwon,  Florian Mintert,  Andreas Buchleitner,  Yoon-Ho Kim;  The coherence time constitutes one of the most critical parameters that determines whether or not interference is observed in an experiment. For photons, it is traditionally determined by the effective spectral bandwidth of the photon. Here we report on multi-photon interference experiments in which the multi-photon coherence time, defined by the width of the interference signal, depends on the number of interfering photons and on the measurement scheme chosen to detect the particles. A theoretical analysis reveals that all multi-photon interference with more than two particles features this dependence, which can be attributed to higher-order effects in the mutual indistinguishability of the particles. As a striking consequence, a single, well-defined many-particle quantum state can exhibit qualitatively different degrees of interference, depending on the chosen observable. Therefore, optimal sensitivity in many-particle quantum interferometry can only be achieved by choosing a suitable detection scheme. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

Vogel;  We study the problem of witnessing entanglement among indistinguishable particles. For this purpose, we derive a set of equations which results in necessary and sufficient conditions for probing multipartite entanglement between arbitrary systems of Bosons or Fermions. The solution of these equations yields the construction of optimal entanglement witnesses for partial and full entanglement in discrete and continuous variable systems. Our approach unifies the verification of entanglement for distinguishable and indistinguishable particles. We provide general solutions for certain observables to study quantum entanglement in systems with different quantum statistics in noisy environments. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.02597;Non-thermal quantum channels as a thermodynamical resource; Miguel Navascués,  Luis Pedro García-Pintos;  Quantum thermodynamics can be understood as a resource theory, whereby thermal states are free and the only allowed operations are unitary transformations commuting with the total Hamiltonian of the system. Previous literature on the subject has just focused on transformations between different state resources, overlooking the fact that quantum operations which do not commute with the total energy also constitute a potentially valuable resource. In this Letter, given a number of non-thermal quantum channels, we study the problem of how to integrate them in a thermal engine so as to distill a maximum amount of work. We find that, in the limit of asymptotically many uses of each channel, the distillable work is an additive function of the considered channels, computable for both finite dimensional quantum operations and bosonic channels. We apply our results to bound the amount of distillable work due to the natural non-thermal processes postulated in the Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber (GRW) collapse model. We find that, although GRW theory predicts the possibility to extract work from the vacuum at no cost, the power which a \emph{collapse engine} could in principle generate is extremely low. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.02669;Gross Pitaevskii Equation with a Morse potential: bound states and  evolution of wave packet; Sukla Pal,  Jayanta K. Bhattacharjee;  We consider systems governed by the Gross Pitaevskii equation (GPE) with the Morse potential $V(x)=D(e^{-2ax}-2e^{-ax})$ as the trapping potential. For positive values of the coupling constant $g$ of the cubic term in GPE, we find that the critical value $g_c$ beyond which there are no bound states scales as $D^{3/4}$ (for large $D$). Studying the quantum evolution of wave packets, we observe that for $g<g_c$, the initial wave packet needs a critical momentum for the packet to escape from the potential. For $g>g_c$, on the otherhand, all initial wave packets escape from the potential and the dynamics is like that of a quantum free particle. For $g<0$, we find that there can be initial conditions for which the escaping wave packet can propagate with very little change in width i,e., it remains almost shape invariant. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.02708;Decomposition of bipartite and multipartite unitary gates into the  product of controlled unitary gates; Lin Chen,  Li Yu;  We show that any unitary operator on the $d_A\times d_B$ system ($d_A\ge 2$) can be decomposed into the product of at most $4d_A-5$ controlled unitary operators. The number can be reduced to $2d_A-1$ when $d_A$ is a power of two. We also prove that three controlled unitaries can implement a bipartite complex permutation operator, and discuss the connection to an analogous result on classical reversible circuits. We further show that any $n$-partite unitary on the space $\mathbb{C}^{d_1}\otimes...\otimes\mathbb{C}^{d_n}$ is the product of at most $[2\prod^{n-1}_{j=1}(2d_j-2)-1]$ controlled unitary gates, each of which is controlled from $n-1$ systems. The number can be further reduced for $n=4$. We also decompose any bipartite unitary into the product of a simple type of bipartite gates and some local unitaries. We derive dimension-independent upper bounds for the CNOT-gate cost or entanglement cost of bipartite permutation unitaries (with the help of ancillas of fixed size) as functions of the Schmidt rank of the unitary. It is shown that such costs under a simple protocol are related to the log-rank conjecture in communication complexity theory via the link of nonnegative rank. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.02710;Quantum theory as a critical regime of language dynamics; Alexei Grinbaum;  Some mathematical theories in physics justify their explanatory superiority over earlier formalisms by the clarity of their postulates. In particular, axiomatic reconstructions drive home the importance of the composition rule and the continuity assumption as two pillars of quantum theory. Our approach sits on these pillars and combines new mathematics with a testable prediction. If the observer is defined by a limit on string complexity, information dynamics leads to an emergent continuous model in the critical regime. Restricting it to a family of binary codes describing `bipartite systems,' we find strong evidence of an upper bound on bipartite correlations equal to $2.82537$. This is measurably different from the Tsirelson bound. The Hilbert space formalism emerges from this mathematical investigation as an effective description of a fundamental discrete theory in the critical regime. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

Lewenstein;"  Current understanding of correlations and quantum phase transitions in many-body systems has significantly improved thanks to the recent intensive studies of their entanglement properties. In contrast, much less is known about the role of quantum non-locality in these systems. On the one hand, standard, ""theorist- and experimentalist-friendly"" many-body observables involve correlations among only few (one, two, rarely three...) particles. On the other hand, most of the available multipartite Bell inequalities involve correlations among many particles. Such correlations are notoriously hard to access theoretically, and even harder experimentally. Typically, there is no Bell inequality for many-body systems built only from low-order correlation functions. Recently, however, it has been shown in [J. Tura et al., Science 344, 1256 (2014)] that multipartite Bell inequalities constructed only from two-body correlation functions are strong enough to reveal non-locality in some many-body states, in particular those relevant for nuclear and atomic physics. The purpose of this lecture is to provide an overview of the problem of quantum correlations in many-body systems - from entanglement to nonlocality - and the methods for their characterization.

Hepburn;"  Laser control of molecular rotation is an area of active research. A number of recent studies has aimed at expanding the reach of rotational control to extreme, previously inaccessible rotational states, as well as controlling the directionality of molecular rotation. Dense ensembles of molecules undergoing ultrafast uni-directional rotation, known as molecular superrotors, are anticipated to exhibit unique properties, from spatially anisotropic diffusion and vortex formation to the creation of powerful acoustic waves and tuneable THz radiation. Here we describe our recent progress in controlling molecular rotation in the regime of high rotational excitation. We review two experimental techniques of producing uni-directional rotational wave packets with a ""chiral train"" of femtosecond pulses and an ""optical centrifuge"". Three complementary detection methods, enabling the direct observation, characterization and control of the superrotor states, are outlined: the one based on coherent Raman scattering, and two other methods employing both resonant and non-resonant multi-photon ionization. The capabilities of the described excitation and detection techniques are demonstrated with a few examples. The paper is concluded with an outlook for future developments.

We propose ""weak maximal Holevo quantity"" with weak measurements as the generalization of the standard Holevo quantity which is defined as the optimal projective measurements. The scenarios that weak measurements is necessary are that only the weak measurements can be performed because for example the system is macroscopic or that one intentionally tries to do so such that the disturbance on the measured system can be controlled for example in quantum key distribution protocols. We evaluate systematically the weak maximal Holevo quantity for Bell-diagonal states and find a series of results. Furthermore, we find that weak measurements can be realized by noise and project measurements. ";Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.02865;Hiking a generalized Dyck path: A tractable way of calculating multimode  boson evolution operators; Kamil Bradler;  A time evolution operator in the interaction picture is given by exponentiating an interaction Hamiltonian $H$. Important examples of Hamiltonians, often encountered in quantum optics, condensed matter and high energy physics, are of a general form $H=r(A^\dagger-A)$, where $A$ is a multimode boson operator and $r$ is the coupling constant. If no simple factorization formula for the evolution operator exists, the calculation of the evolution operator is a notoriously difficult problem. In this case the only available option may be to Taylor expand the operator in $r$ and act on a state of interest $\psi$. But this brute-force method quickly hits the complexity barrier since the number of evaluated expressions increases exponentially. We relate a combinatorial structure called Dyck paths to the action of a boson word (monomial) and a large class of monomial sums on a quantum state $\psi$. This allows us to cross the exponential gap and make the problem of a boson unitary operator evaluation computationally tractable by achieving polynomial-time complexity for an extensive family of physically interesting multimode Hamiltonians. We further test our method on a cubic boson Hamiltonian whose Taylor series is known to diverge for all nonzero values of the coupling constant and an analytic continuation via a Pad\'e approximant must be performed. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)"

Here we ask the question: is a better phase sensitivity possible if the quantum state transfer (QST) is described by a three-mode-mixing model, rather than a beamsplitter? The answer is yes, but only if the portion of the optical state not transferred to the atoms is incorporated via information recycling. Surprisingly, our scheme gives a better sensitivity for lower QST efficiencies and with a sufficiently large degree of squeezing can attain near-Heisenberg-limited sensitivities for arbitrarily small QST efficiencies. Furthermore, we use the quantum Fisher information to demonstrate the near optimality of our scheme. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph)"

Avalos,  Hai-Jing Wang,  Alexander Pines;  We report bulk, room-temperature hyperpolarization of 13C nuclear spins observed via high-field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The hyperpolarization is achieved by optical pumping (OP) of nitrogen vacancy defect centers in diamond accompanied by dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). The technique harnesses the large optically-induced spin polarization of NV- centers at room temperature, which is many orders of magnitude greater than thermal equilibrium polarization and typically achievable only at sub-Kelvin temperatures. Transfer of the spin polarization to the 13C nuclear spins is accomplished via a combination of OP and microwave irradiation. The OP/DNP is performed at 420 mT, where inductive detection of NMR is feasible, in contrast to the typically exploited level anticrossing regimes at 100 mT and 50 mT. Here, we report a bulk nuclear spin polarization of 6%. This polarization was generated in situ and detected with a standard, inductive NMR probe without the need for sample shuttling or precise crystal orientation. Hyperpolarization via OP/DNP should operate at arbitrary magnetic fields, enabling orders of magnitude sensitivity enhancement for NMR of solids and liquids at ambient conditions. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.02926;Anomalous behavior of the energy gap in the one-dimensional quantum XY  model; Yuuki Yamanaka,  Hidetoshi Nishimori;  We show for the one-dimensional quantum $XY$ model with $s=1/2$ that the energy gap between the ground and first excited states behaves anomalously as a function of the system size at the first-order quantum phase transition. Although it is generally the case that the energy gap closes exponentially at a quantum first-order transition, the gap in the present model behaves non-monotonically as a function of the system size, apparently very irregularly in some cases. This property of the gap is similar to that of the infinite-range quantum $XY$ model, in which the gap closes polynomially, exponentially, or even factorially fast depending on the choice of the series of system sizes toward the thermodynamic limit. This observation is surprising in consideration of the apparent maturity of our understanding of the one-dimensional quantum $XY$ model. Our result is also important from the viewpoint of quantum annealing, where the rate of gap closing determines the efficiency of computation. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)"

Our main tool here is the ""separability witnesses"", and a connection between ""separability witnesses"" and a new kind of positivity of matrices--- ""Power Positive Matrices"" is drawn. Such connection is employed to demonstrate that multi-qubit quantum states with Dicke states being its eigenvectors is separable if and only if two related Hankel matrices are positive semidefinite. By employing this criterion, we are able to show that such state is separable if and only if it's partial transpose is non-negative, which confirms the conjecture in [Wolfe, Yelin, Phys. Rev. Lett.

Then, we present a class of bosonic states in $d\otimes d$ system such that for general $d$, determine its separability is NP-hard although verifiable conditions for separability is easily derived in case $d=3,4$.

Mitchell,  Carlos Abellan,  Waldimar Amaya;"  We describe a methodology and standard of proof for experimental claims of quantum random number generation (QRNG), analogous to well-established methods from precision measurement. For appropriately constructed physical implementations, lower bounds on the quantum contribution to the average min-entropy can be derived from measurements on the QRNG output. Given these bounds, randomness extractors allow generation of nearly perfect ""{\epsilon}-random"" bit streams. An analysis of experimental uncertainties then gives experimentally derived confidence levels on the {\epsilon} randomness of these sequences. We demonstrate the methodology by application to phase-diffusion QRNG, driven by spontaneous emission as a trusted randomness source. All other factors, including classical phase noise, amplitude fluctuations, digitization errors and correlations due to finite detection bandwidth, are treated with paranoid caution, i.e., assuming the worst possible behaviors consistent with observations. A data-constrained numerical optimization of the distribution of untrusted parameters is used to lower bound the average min-entropy. Under this paranoid analysis, the QRNG remains efficient, generating at least 2.3 quantum random bits per symbol with 8-bit digitization and at least 0.83 quantum random bits per symbol with binary digitization, at a confidence level of 0.99993. The result demonstrates ultrafast QRNG with strong experimental guarantees. ";Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.03008;Influence of Dzyaloshinshkii-Moriya interaction on quantum correlations  in two qubit Werner states and MEMS; Kapil K. Sharma,  S. N. Pandey;  In this paper we study the influence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction on quantum correlations in two qubit Werner states and maximally entangled mixed states (MEMS). We consider our system as a closed system of a qubits pair and one auxiliary qubit which interact with any one of the qubit of the pair through DM interaction. We show that DM interaction, taken along any direction (x or y or z), does not affect two qubit Werner states. On the other hand the MEMS are affected by x and z components of DM interaction and remain unaffected by the y component. Further, we find that the state (i.e probability amplitude) of auxiliary qubit do not affect the quantum correlations in both the states, only DM interaction strength influences the quantum correlations. So one can avoid the intention to prepare the specific state of auxiliary qubit to manipulate the quantum correlations in both the states. We mention here that avoiding the preparation of state can contribute to cost reduction in quantum information processing. We also observe the phenomenon of entanglement sudden death in the present study. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

Here, we report on the realisation of a closely analogous experiment with atoms instead of photons. This opens the prospect of testing Bell's inequalities involving mechanical observables of massive particles, such as momentum, using methods inspired by quantum optics, with an eye on theories of the quantum-to-classical transition. Our work also demonstrates a new way to produce and benchmark twin-atom pairs that may be of interest for quantum information processing and quantum simulation. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)"

We then address the estimation of the temperature of the sample from the analysis of correlations using a quantum non demolishing Faraday spectroscopy method. Finally, we demonstrate that for sufficiently low temperatures the proposed measurements are optimal to estimate accurately the temperature of the sample. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)"

Since it relies on the full algebra of observables, our measure for composed systems is partition independent and witnesses the global quantum nature of a state. We show that such quantity can be experimentally measured with an interferometric setup and that, when an arbitrary bipartition is introduced, it detects the one-way quantum correlations restricted to one of the two subsystems. We finally show that, by combining only two projective measurements and carrying out the interference procedure, our measure becomes an efficient universal witness of quantum discord and non-classical correlations. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0034;On convex optimization problems in quantum information theory; Mark W.

In most cases, finding exact solutions to these problems is usually impossible. As inspired by earlier investigations into the relative entropy of entanglement [Phys. Rev. A 78 032310 (2008)], we introduce a general method to solve the converse problem rather than find explicit solutions. That is, given a matrix in a convex set, we determine a family of convex functions that are minimized at this point. This method allows us find explicit formulae for the relative entropy of entanglement and the Rains bound, two well-known upper bounds on the distillable entanglement, and yields interesting information about these quantities, such as the fact that they coincide in the case where at least one subsystem of a multipartite state is a qubit. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)"

Can one construct OTM's whose security follows from some physical principle? This is not possible in a fully-classical world, or in a fully-quantum world, but there is evidence that OTM's can be built using ""isolated qubits"" -- qubits that cannot be entangled, but can be accessed using adaptive sequences of single-qubit measurements. Here we present new constructions for OTM's using isolated qubits, which improve on previous work in several respects: they achieve a stronger ""single-shot"" security guarantee, which is stated in terms of the (smoothed) min-entropy; they are proven secure against adversaries who can perform arbitrary local operations and classical communication (LOCC); and they are efficiently implementable. These results use Wiesner's idea of conjugate coding, combined with error-correcting codes that approach the capacity of the q-ary symmetric channel, and a high-order entropic uncertainty relation, which was originally developed for cryptography in the bounded quantum storage model.

This is the Quantum Zeno Effect (QZE). Repeatedly asking a quantum system ""are you still in your initial state?"" blocks its coherent evolution through measurement back-action. Quantum Zeno Dynamics (QZD) leaves more freedom to the system. Instead of pinning it to a single state, it sets a border in its evolution space. Repeatedly asking the system ""did you cross the border?"" makes it impenetrable. Since the border can be designed at will by choosing the measured observable, QZD allows one to tailor the system's evolution space. Recent proposals, particularly in the Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics (CQED) context, highlight the interest of QZD for quantum state engineering tasks, which are the key to quantumenabled technologies and quantum information processing. We report the observation of QZD in the 51-dimension Hilbert space of a large angular momentum J = 25. Continuous selective interrogation limits the evolution of this angular momentum to an adjustable multi-dimensional subspace. This confined dynamics leads to the production of non-classical ""Schr\""odinger cat"" states, quantum superpositions of angular momentums pointing in different directions. These states are promising for sensitive metrology of electric and magnetic fields. This QZD approach could be generalized to other systems, opening novel perspectives for quantum information processing. ";Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

We improve the recent bounds by Coles and Piani, which are known to be stronger than the well known result of Maassen and Uffink. Furthermore, we find a novel bound based on majorization techniques, which also happens to be stronger than the recent results involving largest singular values of submatrices of the unitary matrix connecting both bases. The first set of new bounds give better results for unitary matrices close to the Fourier matrix, while the second one provides a significant improvement in the opposite sectors. Some results derived admit generalization to arbitrary mixed states, so that corresponding bounds are increased by the von Neumann entropy of the measured state. The majorization approach is finally extended to the case of several measurements. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0159;A Generalized Quantum Theory; Gerd Niestegge;  In quantum mechanics, the selfadjoint Hilbert space operators play a triple role as observables, generators of the dynamical groups and statistical operators defining the mixed states. One might expect that this is typical of Hilbert space quantum mechanics, but it is not. The same triple role occurs for the elements of a certain ordered Banach space in a much more general theory based upon quantum logics and a conditional probability calculus (which is a quantum logical model of the Lueders-von Neumann measurement process). It is shown how positive groups, automorphism groups, Lie algebras and statistical operators emerge from one major postulate - the non-existence of third-order interference (third-order interference and its impossibility in quantum mechanics were discovered by R. Sorkin in 1994). This again underlines the power of the combination of the conditional probability calculus with the postulate that there is no third-order interference. In two earlier papers, its impact on contextuality and nonlocality had already been revealed. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)"

We analyze the teleportation of ensembles of arbitrary pure single-mode Gaussian states using these schemes and see how they fare against the optimal measure-and-prepare strategies -- the benchmarks. In the VBK case, we allow for non-unit gain tuning and consider a class of possibly non-Gaussian resources in order to optimize performance. The results suggest that the AR scheme may likely be a more suitable candidate for beating the benchmarks in the teleportation of squeezing, capable of achieving this for moderate resources in comparison to the VBK scheme. Moreover, our quantification of resources, whereby different protocols are compared at fixed values of the entanglement entropy or the mean energy of the resource states, brings into question any advantage due to non-Gaussianity for quantum teleportation of Gaussian states.

We propose a measurement scheme to detect quantum backaction via correlation measurements to answer this question for a bath coupled to a single qubit. The presence of backaction leads to a dependence of correlations of subsequent initialization-evolution-readout cycles on how the qubit is manipulated in between. We compute the autocorrelation function for both an instructive spin model and the realistic case of an electron spin coupled to a bath of $10^6$ nuclear spins, as found in gated GaAs quantum dots, and show that backaction from the qubit onto the nuclear spin bath should be detectable even in such a large system. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)"

We also present the concept of quantum decoupler -- a device implementing an inverse operation to quantum routing. We demonstrate that both quantum router and decoupler can work as specialized disentangling gates. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

Geometric discord based on the trace distance and the Bures distance are shown to be well-defined quantum correlation measures. Here, we examine their particular dynamical behaviors under independent as well as common structured reservoirs, and reveal their robustness against decoherence. We showed that the two well-defined geometric discord may be preserved well, or even be improved and generated by the noisy process of the common reservoir. Moreover, we also provided a strategy for long-time preservation of these two geometric discord in independent reservoirs. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

T. Johnsson;  We theoretically investigate a scheme to enhance spin squeezing in a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) by utilizing the inherent mean-field dynamics of the condensate. Due to the asymmetry in the scattering lengths, the two components exhibit density oscillations where they spatially separate and recombine. The effective non-linearity responsible for spin squeezing is increased by up to three orders of magnitude when the two components spatially separate \cite{treutlein2010}. We perform a multi-mode simulation of the system using the truncated Wigner method, and show that this method can be used to create significant spin squeezing in systems where the effective nonlinearity would ordinarily be too small, and that strong spatial dynamics resulting from large particle numbers aren't necessarily detrimental to generating spin-squeezing. We develop a simplified semi-analytic model that gives good agreement with our multi-mode simulation, and will be useful for predicting spin-squeezing in a range of different systems. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0335;Distributed manipulation of two-qubit entanglement with coupled  continuous variables; Li-Tuo Shen,  Rong-Xin Chen,  Huai-Zhi Wu,  Zhen-Biao Yang;  We study the dynamics of two qubits separately sent through two coupled resonators, each initially containing a coherent state field. We present analytical arguments and numerical calculations for the qubit-field system under different two-qubit initial states, photon hopping strengths, and detunings. In far off-resonant regime, the maximal entanglement of two qubits can be generated with the initial qubit state in which one qubit is in the excited state and the other is in the ground state, and the initially maximal two-qubit entanglement can be frozen and fully revived even for large mean photon number. When the qubits are both initially in their excited states or ground states, the qubit-qubit entanglement birth and death apparently appear in the regime where the photon hopping strength is close to qubit-field detuning, and its peaks do not decrease monotonically as the interaction time increases. It is interesting to observe that when there is photon hopping strength between two fields, the field-field entanglement can be larger than one and increases as the initial amplitude of the coherent state grows. By postselecting the fields both in their coherent states, the entanglement of two initially unentangled qubits can be largely improved. Our present setup is fundamental for the distributed quantum information processing and applicable to different physical qubit-resonator systems. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

The steady state solution exhibits n+1 fold degeneracy, for a chain of length n, due to existence of (strong) Liouvillian U(1) symmetry. The latter can be exploited to introduce a chemical potential and define a grand canonical nonequilibrium steady state ensemble. The matrix product form of the solution entails an infinitely-dimensional representation of a non-trivial Lie algebra (semidirect product of sl_2 and a non-nilpotent radical) and hints to a novel Yang-Baxter integrability structure. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el); Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0351;The Two Bell's Theorems of John Bell; Howard M. Wiseman;"  Many of the heated arguments about the meaning of ""Bell's theorem"" arise because this phrase can refer to two different theorems that John Bell proved, the first in 1964 and the second in 1976. His 1964 theorem is the incompatibility of quantum phenomena with the dual assumptions of locality and determinism. His 1976 theorem is the incompatibility of quantum phenomena with the unitary property of local causality. This is contrary to Bell's own later assertions, that his 1964 theorem began with that single, and indivisible, assumption of local causality (even if not by that name). While there are other forms of Bell's theorems --- which I present to explain the relation between Jarrett-completeness, ""fragile locality"", and EPR-completeness --- I maintain that Bell's two versions are the essential ones. Although the two Bell's theorems are logically equivalent, their assumptions are not, and the different versions of the theorem suggest quite different conclusions, which are embraced by different communities. For realists, the notion of local causality, ruled out by Bell's 1976 theorem, is motivated implicitly by Reichenbach's Principle of common cause and explicitly by the Principle of relativistic causality, and it is the latter which must be forgone. Operationalists pay no heed to Reichenbach's Principle, but wish to keep the Principle of relativistic causality, which, bolstered by an implicit ""Principle of agent-causation"", implies their notion of locality. Thus for operationalists, Bell's theorem is the 1964 one, and implies that it is determinism that must be forgone. I discuss why the two `camps' are drawn to these different conclusions, and what can be done to increase mutual understanding.

The experiment is done with the standard MZI with the beam splitter or the beam merger being continuously varied. The losses are deliberately introduced either inside the MZI (the two arms between the beam splitter and beam mergers) or outside the MZI (after the beam merger). It is proved that the unbalanced losses have great influence on the predictability $P$ (particle nature) and visibility $V$ (wave nature). For the former case the duality inequality holds while for the later the duality inequality is ``violated''. We get $P^2+V^2>1$. This ``violation'' could be eliminated in principle by switching the two paths and detectors and then averaging the results. The observed results can be exactly explained theoretically. The experiment is done with coherent beam, instead of single photons, and we have proved that they are exactly equivalent in duality experiment with MZI. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

Our scheme relies on the dressing of the qubit-field coupling by periodic modulations of the qubit energy. In the dressed basis, the radiative decay of the first qubit becomes an effective incoherent pumping mechanism that injects energy into the system, hence turning dissipation to our advantage. A second, auxiliary qubit is used to shape the decay within the cavity, in such a way that lasing occurs in a squeezed basis of the cavity mode. We characterize the system both by mean-field theory and exact calculations. Our work may find applications in the generation of squeezing and entanglement in circuit QED, as well as in the study of dissipative many-body phase transitions. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0375;Highly symmetric POVMs and their informational power; Wojciech Słomczyński,  Anna Szymusiak;  We discuss the dependence of the Shannon entropy of normalized finite rank-1 POVMs on the choice of the input state, looking for the states that minimize this quantity. To distinguish the class of measurements where the problem can be solved analytically, we introduce the notion of highly symmetric POVMs and classify them in dimension two (for qubits). In this case we prove that the entropy is minimal, and hence the relative entropy (informational power) is maximal, if and only if the input state is orthogonal to one of the states constituting a POVM. The method used in the proof, employing the Michel theory of critical points for group action, the Hermite interpolation and the structure of invariant polynomials for unitary-antiunitary groups, can also be applied in higher dimensions and for other entropy-like functions. The links between entropy minimization and entropic uncertainty relations, the Wehrl entropy and the quantum dynamical entropy are described. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Information Theory (cs.IT); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)"

We investigate operations, which leave their Tsirelson bound invariant, but change their classical bound. The optimal observables are unaffected except for a relative rotation of the two laboratories. We illustrate the utility of these operations by giving explicit examples: We prove that for a fixed quantum state and fixed measurement setup except for a relative rotation of the two laboratories, there is a Bell inequality that is maximally violated for this rotation, and we optimise some Bell inequalities with respect to the maximal violation. Finally we optimise the qutrit to qubit ratio of some dimension witnessing Bell inequalities. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

We present here a scheme using trapped open-shell $^2\Sigma$ polar molecules that allows dipolar exchange processes between nearest and next-nearest neighbors to be controlled to construct a generalized transverse Ising spin Hamiltonian with tunable $XX$, $YY$ and $XY$ couplings in the rotating frame of the driving lasers. The scheme requires a moderately strong bias magnetic field with near-infrared light to provide local tuning of the qubit energy gap, and mid-infrared pulses to perform rotational state transfer via stimulated Raman adiabatic passage. No interaction between qubits is present in the absence of the infrared driving. We analyze the fidelity of the resulting two-qubit matchgate, and demonstrate its robustness as a function of the driving parameters. We discuss a realistic application of the system for universal matchgate quantum computing in optical lattices. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph); Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)"

Palenik;  Despite the fact that it has been known since the time of Heisenberg that quantum operators obey a quantum version of Newton's laws, students are often told that derivations of quantum mechanics must necessarily follow from the Hamiltonian or Lagrangian formulations of mechanics. Here, we first derive the existing Heisenberg equations of motion from Newton's laws and the uncertainty principle using only the equations $F=\frac{dP}{dt}$, $P=m\frac{dV}{dt}$, and $\left[X,P\right]=i$. Then, a new expression for the propagator is derived that makes a connection between time evolution in quantum mechanics and the motion of a classical particle under Newton's laws. The propagator is solved for three cases where an exact solution is possible 1) the free particle 2) the harmonic oscillator 3) a constant force, or linear potential in the standard interpretation. Such a picture may be useful for students as they make the transition from classical to quantum mechanics and help solidify the equivalence of the Hamiltonian, Lagrangian, and Newtonian formulations of physics in their minds. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0404;A generalization of the Entropy Power Inequality to Bosonic Quantum  Systems; Giacomo De Palma,  Andrea Mari,  Vittorio Giovannetti;  In most communication schemes information is transmitted via travelling modes of electromagnetic radiation. These modes are unavoidably subject to environmental noise along any physical transmission medium and the quality of the communication channel strongly depends on the minimum noise achievable at the output. For classical signals such noise can be rigorously quantified in terms of the associated Shannon entropy and it is subject to a fundamental lower bound called entropy power inequality. Electromagnetic fields are however quantum mechanical systems and then, especially in low intensity signals, the quantum nature of the information carrier cannot be neglected and many important results derived within classical information theory require non-trivial extensions to the quantum regime. Here we prove one possible generalization of the Entropy Power Inequality to quantum bosonic systems. The impact of this inequality in quantum information theory is potentially large and some relevant implications are considered in this work. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0428;Parity-Time Symmetry Breaking beyond One Dimension: The Role of  Degeneracy; Li Ge,  A. Douglas Stone;  We consider the role of degeneracy in Parity-Time (PT) symmetry breaking for non-hermitian wave equations beyond one dimension. We show that if the spectrum is degenerate in the absence of T-breaking, and T is broken in a generic manner (without preserving other discrete symmetries), then the standard PT-symmetry breaking transition does not occur, meaning that the spectrum is complex even for infinitesimal strength of gain and loss. However the realness of the entire spectrum can be preserved over a finite interval if additional discrete symmetries X are imposed when T is broken, if X decouple all degenerate modes. When this is true only for a subset of the degenerate spectrum, there can be a partial PT transition in which this subset remains real over a finite interval of T-breaking. If the spectrum has odd-degeneracy, a fraction of the degenerate spectrum can remain in the symmetric phase even without imposing additional discrete symmetries, and they are analogous to dark states in atomic physics. These results are illustrated by the example of different T-breaking perturbations of a uniform dielectric disk and sphere, and a group theoretical analysis is given in the disk case. Finally, we show that multimode coupling is capable of restoring the T-symmetric phase at finite T-breaking. We also analyze these questions when the parity operator is replaced by another spatial symmetry operator and find that the behavior can be qualitatively different. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Optics (physics.optics)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0447;Estimation of quantum states by weak and projective measurements; Debmalya Das,  Arvind;"  We explore the possibility of using ""weak"" measurements to carry out quantum state tomography. Given a certain fixed number of copies of identically prepared states of a qubit, we simulate state tomography using weak as well as projective measurements. Due to the collapse of the state after measurement, we cannot re-use the state after a projective measurement. If the coupling strength between the quantum system and the measurement device is made weaker, the disturbance caused to the state can be lowered. This then allows us to re-use the same member of the ensemble for further measurements and thus extract more information from the system. However, this happens at the expense of getting imprecise information from the first measurement. We simulate this scheme for a single qubit and show that under certain circumstances, it can outperform the projective measurement-based tomography scheme. This opens up the possibility of new ways of extracting information from quantum ensembles. We study the efficacy of this scheme for different coupling strengths. ";Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

Combining these functions in a light-matter interface that can be integrated on-chip with other photonic quantum technologies, e.g. sources of entangled photons, is an important step towards these applications. To date there have only been a few demonstrations of coherent pulse manipulation utilizing optical storage devices compatible with quantum states, and that only in atomic gas media (making integration difficult) and with limited capabilities. Here we describe how a broadband waveguide quantum memory based on the Atomic Frequency Comb (AFC) protocol can be used as a programmable processor for essentially arbitrary spectral and temporal manipulations of individual quantum optical pulses. Using weak coherent optical pulses at the few photon level, we experimentally demonstrate sequencing, time-to-frequency multiplexing and demultiplexing, splitting, interfering, temporal and spectral filtering, compressing and stretching as well as selective delaying. Our integrated light-matter interface offers high-rate, robust and easily configurable manipulation of quantum optical pulses and brings fully practical optical quantum devices one step closer to reality. Furthermore, as the AFC protocol is suitable for storage of intense light pulses, our processor may also find applications in classical communications. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0489;Robust protocols for securely expanding randomness and distributing keys  using untrusted quantum devices; Carl A. Miller,  Yaoyun Shi;  Randomness is a vital resource for modern day information processing, especially for cryptography. A wide range of applications critically rely on abundant, high quality random numbers generated securely. Here we show how to expand a random seed at an exponential rate without trusting the underlying quantum devices. Our approach is secure against the most general adversaries, and has the following new features: cryptographic level of security, tolerating a constant level of imprecision in the devices, requiring only a unit size quantum memory per device component for the honest implementation, and allowing a large natural class of constructions for the protocol. In conjunct with a recent work by Chung, Shi and Wu, it also leads to robust unbounded expansion using just 2 multi-part devices. When adapted for distributing cryptographic keys, our method achieves, for the first time, exponential expansion combined with cryptographic security and noise tolerance. The proof proceeds by showing that the Renyi divergence of the outputs of the protocol (for a specific bounding operator) decreases linearly as the protocol iterates. At the heart of the proof are a new uncertainty principle on quantum measurements, and a method for simulating trusted measurements with untrusted devices. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

Decoherence that plagues real-world devices can be particle loss, or thermal excitation and relaxation, or dephasing due to external noise sources -- and also due to prior parameter uncertainty. All these adversely affect precision estimation of time, phase or frequency. We develop a novel technique uncovering the uniquely optimal probe states of the N `qubits' alongside new tight bounds on precision under local and collective mechanisms of these noise types above. For large quantum ensembles where numerical techniques fail, the problem reduces by analogy to finding the ground state of a 1-D particle in a potential well; the shape of the well is dictated by the type and strength of decoherence. The formalism is applied to prototypical Mach-Zehnder and Ramsey interferometers to discover the ultimate performance of real-world instruments.

The time variables involved in this protocol become coupled when using entangled light, which provides high selectivity and background free measurement of the various resonances. Entangled light can resolve certain states even when strong background due to fast dephasing suppresses the resonant features when probed by classical light. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph); Optics (physics.optics)"

Dowling;  Boson sampling is a specific quantum computation, which is likely hard to implement efficiently on a classical computer. The task is to sample the output photon number distribution of a linear optical interferometric network, which is fed with single-photon Fock state inputs. A question that has been asked is if the sampling problems associated with any other input quantum states of light (other than the Fock states) to a linear optical network and suitable output detection strategies are also of similar computational complexity as boson sampling. We consider the states that differ from the Fock states by a displacement operation, namely the displaced Fock states and the photon-added coherent states. It is easy to show that the sampling problem associated with displaced single-photon Fock states and a displaced photon number detection scheme is in the same complexity class as boson sampling for all values of displacement. On the other hand, we show that the sampling problem associated with single-photon-added coherent states and the same displaced photon number detection scheme demonstrates a computational complexity transition. It transitions from being just as hard as boson sampling when the input coherent amplitudes are sufficiently small, to a classically simulatable problem in the limit of large coherent amplitudes. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

The price we pay for this simplification is that, at 39 pulses, our sequences are significantly longer than the best numerically obtained sequences. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)"

As such a non-Abelian geometric phase accumulation in nitrogen-vacancy centers has potential advantages for applications as gyroscopes. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

Analogously, the informational power quantifies the amount of classical information that can be extracted by a quantum measurement. For both quantities, we provide upper and lower bounds that depend only on the dimension of the system, and we prove their tightness. In the case of symmetric informationally complete (SIC) ensembles and measurements, stronger bounds are provided and their tightness proved for qubits and qutrits. From our upper bounds, we notice, perhaps surprisingly, that the statistics generated by SIC ensembles or measurements in arbitrary dimension, though optimal for tomographic purposes, in fact never contains more than just one bit of information, the rest being constituted by completely random bits. On the other hand, from our lower bounds, we obtain an explicit strategy beating the so-called ""pretty-good"" one for the extraction of mutual information in the case of SIC ensembles and measurements.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0660;Quantum Algorithm for Linear Regression; Guoming Wang;  We present a quantum algorithm for fitting a linear regression model to a given data set using the least squares approach. Different from previous algorithms which yield a quantum state encoding the optimal parameters, our algorithm outputs these numbers in the classical form. So by running it once, one completely determines the fitted model and then can use it to make predictions on new data at little cost. Moreover, our algorithm works in the standard oracle model, and can handle data sets with nonsparse design matrices. It runs in time $\operatorname{poly}(\operatorname{log}(N), d, \kappa, 1/\epsilon)$, where $N$ is the size of the data set, $d$ is the number of adjustable parameters, $\kappa$ is the condition number of the design matrix, and $\epsilon$ is the desired precision in the output. We also show that the polynomial dependence on $d$ and $\kappa$ is necessary. Thus, our algorithm cannot be significantly improved. Furthermore, we also give a quantum algorithm that estimates the quality of the least-squares fit (without computing its parameters explicitly). This algorithm runs faster than the one for finding this fit, and can be used to check whether the given data set qualifies for linear regression in the first place. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0738;Noise resistance of violation of local causality for pure three-qutrit  entangled states; Wieslaw Laskowski,  Junghee Ryu,  Marek Zukowski;  Bell's Theorem started with two qubits, spins $1/2$. It is a no-go statement on classical (local causal) models of quantum correlations. Only after 25 years, it turned out that for three qubits the situation is even more mind boggling. General statements concerning higher dimensional systems, qutrits etc., started to appear even later, once the spin (higher than $1/2$) picture was replaced by a more broad one, allowing all possible observables. This work is continuation of the Gdansk effort to take advantage of the fact that Bell Theorem can be put in form of a linear programming problem, which in turn can be translated into a computer code. Our results are numerical and classify the strength of non-classicality of various families of three-qutrit states, as measured by resistance to noise. This is a previously uncharted territory. The results may be helpful in suggesting which three-qutrit states are handy for applications in quantum information protocols. One of the surprises is that the W state turns out to have a stronger non-classicality than the GHZ state. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

Santoro,  Amit Dutta;"  We study the dynamical fidelity $\mathcal{F} (t)$ and the Loschmidt echo $\mathcal{L} (t)$, following a periodic driving of the transverse magnetic field of a quantum Ising chain (back and forth across the quantum critical point) by calculating the overlap between the initial ground state and the state reached after $n$ periods $\tau$. We show that $\log{\mathcal{F}}(n\tau)/L$ (the logarithm of the fidelity per-site) reaches a steady value in the asymptotic limit $n\to \infty$, and we derive an exact analytical expression for this quantity. Remarkably, the steady state value of $[\log{\mathcal{F}}(n\tau\to \infty)]/L$ shows memory of non-trivial phase information which is instead hidden in the case of thermodynamic quantities; this conclusion, moreover, is not restricted to 1-dimensional models.

Interactions between nearest-neighbouring ions could then be turned on and off by tuning the ions' relative positions and frequencies. We demonstrate and characterize the operation of a planar-electrode ion-trap array. Driving the trap with a network of phase-locked radio-frequency (RF) resonators which provide independently variable voltage amplitudes we vary the position and motional frequency of a 40Ca+ ion in two dimensions within the trap array. With suitable miniaturization of the trap structure, this provides a viable architecture for large-scale quantum simulations. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0810;Measures of disturbance and incompatibility for quantum measurements; Prabha Mandayam,  M. D. Srinivas;"  We propose a class of incompatibility measures for quantum observables based on quantifying the effect of a measurement of one observable on the statistics of the outcomes of another. Specifically, for a pair of observables $A$ and $B$ with purely discrete spectra, we compare the following two probability distributions: one resulting from a measurement of $A$ followed by a measurement of $B$ on a given state, and the other obtained from a measurement of $B$ alone on the same state. We show that maximizing the distance between these two distributions over all states yields a valid measure of the incompatibility of observables $A$ and $B$, which is zero if and only if they commute and is strictly greater than zero (and less than or equal to one) otherwise. For finite dimensional systems, we obtain a tight upper bound on the incompatibility of any pair of observables and show that the bound is attained when the observables are totally non-degenerate and associated with mutually unbiased bases. In the process, we also establish an important connection between the incompatibility of a pair of observables and the maximal disturbances due to their measurements. Finally, we indicate how these measures of incompatibility and disturbance can be extended to the more general class of non-projective measurements. In particular, we obtain a non-trivial upper bound on the incompatibility of one L\""uders instrument with another. ";Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0821;Atomic form factor for twisted vortex photons interacting with atoms; Pierson Guthrey,  Lev Kaplan,  J. H. McGuire;  The relatively new atomic form factor for twisted (vortex) beams, which carry orbital angular momentum (OAM), is considered and compared to the conventional atomic form factor for plane wave beams that carry only spin angular momentum (SAM). Since the vortex symmetry of a twisted photon is more complex that that of a plane-wave, evaluation of the atomic form factor is also more complex for twisted photons. On the other hand, the twisted photon has additional parameters, including the OAM quantum number, $\ell$, the nodal radial number, $p$, and the Rayleigh range, $z_R$ that determines the cone angle of the vortex. This Rayleigh range may be used as a variable parameter to control, in new ways, the interaction of twisted photons with matter. Here we address: i) normalization of the vortex atomic form factor, ii) displacement of target atoms away from the center of the beam vortex, and iii) formulation of transition probabilities for a variety of photon-atom processes. We attend to features related to new experiments that can test the range of validity and accuracy of calculations of these variations of the atomic form factor. Using the absolute square of the form factor for vortex beams, we introduce a vortex factor that can be directly measured. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

Recently, surface plasmons have been introduced to this application because they can confine and manipulate light beyond the diffraction limit. In this study, the on-chip quantum interference of two single surface plasmons was achieved using dielectric-loaded surface-plasmon-polariton waveguides. The high visibility (greater than 90%) proves the bosonic nature of single plasmons and emphasizes the feasibility of achieving basic quantum logic gates for linear optical quantum computation. The effect of intrinsic losses in plasmonic waveguides with regard to quantum information processing is also discussed. Although the influence of this effect was negligible in the current experiment, our studies reveal that such losses can dramatically reduce quantum interference visibility in certain cases; thus, quantum coherence must be carefully considered when designing QPIC devices.

Horodecki;  It is known that the local bound of a Bell inequality is sensitive to the knowledge of the external observer about the settings statistics. Here we ask how that sensitivity depends on the structure of that knowledge. It turns out that in some cases it may happen that the local bound is much more sensitive to adversary's knowledge about settings of one party than the other. Remarkably, there are Bell inequalities which are highly asymmetric with respect to the adversary's knowledge about local settings. This property may be viewed as a hidden intrinsic asymmetry of Bell inequalities. Potential implications of the revealed asymmetry effect are also discussed. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

Using quantum devices, such procedure is possible even without trusting the devices used, by utilizing correlations between outcomes of parts of the devices. We show here how to extract random bits with an arbitrarily low bias from a single arbitrarily weak min-entropy source in a device independent setting. To do this we use Mermin devices that exhibit super-classical correlations. Number of devices used scales polynomially in the length of the random sequence $n$. Our protocol is robust, it can tolerate devices that malfunction with a probability dropping polynomially in $n$ at the cost of a minor increase of the number of devices used. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

For the case of two qubits, the proposed decomposition reproduces the Schmidt decomposition and therefore, in the case of a higher number of qubits, can be considered as its generalization. We analyze the geometrical aspects of the proposed representation and its invariant properties under the action of local unitary and local invertible transformations. As an application, we identify the most general classes of entanglement and representative states for any number of qubits in a symmetric state. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.1087;The quantum vacuum; G. S. Paraoanu;  The vacuum is the lowest energy state of a field in a certain region of space. This definition implies that no particles can be present in the vacuum state. In classical physics, the only features of vacuum are those of its geometry. For example, in the general theory of relativity the geometry is a dynamical structure that guides the motion of matter, and, in turn, it is bent and curved by the presence of matter. Other than this, the classical vacuum is a structure void of any physical properties, since classically properties are strictly associated with physical objects such as particles and finite-amplitude fields. The situation is very different in quantum physics. As I will show in this paper, the difference stems from the fact that in quantum physics the properties are not strictly tied to objects. We know for example that physical properties come into existence - as values of observables - only when the object is measured. Thus, quantum physics allows us to detach properties from objects. This has consequences: one does not need pre-existing real objects to create actual properties, and indeed under certain perturbations the quantum vacuum produces observable effects such as energy shifts and creation of particles. An open question is if by necessity the vacuum comes with an embedded geometry, and if it is possible to construct viable physical theories in which geometry is detached from the vacuum. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)"

To investigate non-trivial equilibration we therefore consider a restricted set of measurements. When the initial state is spread over many energy levels, and we consider the set of observables for which this state is an eigenstate, most observables are initially out of equilibrium yet equilibrate rapidly. Moreover, all two-outcome measurements, where one of the projectors is of low rank, equilibrate rapidly. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)"

The technique is to solve the time-independent Schroedinger eigenvalue problem as a perturbation series in which the perturbation parameter is the energy itself. Unlike nearly all perturbation series for physical problems, for the ground state this perturbation expansion is convergent and, even though the ground-state energy is in general not small compared with 1, the perturbative results are numerically accurate. The perturbation series is divergent for higher energy levels but can be easily evaluated by using methods such as Pade summation. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)"

An additional challenge to this claim results from the exponential number of protective measurements required to reconstruct multi-qubit states. We suggest that the failure of protective measurement to settle the question of the meaning of the wave function is entirely expected, for protective measurement is but an application of the standard quantum formalism, and none of the hard foundational questions can ever be settled in this way. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

It is shown that the standard deterministic ES protocol is related with an optimal minimum-error strategy. In this case the amount of entanglement of the states resulting from swapping is, in general, lower than the maximum achievable for the quantum channels involved. In this regard, we show that the ES protocol can be probabilistically improved resorting to optimal maximum-confidence (MC) discrimination strategy. Additionally, we show that the success probability of achieving entanglement above a prescribed value from standard deterministic ES can be increased by applying sequential MC measurements. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

The method consists of transformation of the infinite domain to the bounded domain in $(0, \pi)$ and using the Fourier sine series as a set of basis functions for the SM. It is shown that with an appropriate choice of transformation functions, this method manages to preserve the good properties of original SMs; more precisely, superb computational efficiency when high level of accuracy is necessary. This is made possible by analytically exploiting the properties of the transformation function and the Fourier sine series. An especially important property of this approach is the possibility of calculating the Hartree energy very efficiently. This is done by exploiting the positive properties of the sine series as a basis set and conducting an extinctive part of the calculations analytically. We illustrate the efficiency of this method and implement it to solve the Poisson's and Helmholtz equations in both one and three dimensions. The efficiency of the method is verified through a comparison to recently published results for both one and three dimensional problems.

We verify general scaling properties of the defects dynamics and demonstrate that entanglement between the defects can be a stationary feature of these dynamics. We then analyse entanglement in chains composed of tens of ions and propose a measurement scheme which allows one to verify the existence of the predicted entangled state. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

Such experiments exploit the non-classical superposition of two or more position and momentum states which are coherently split and rejoined to interfere. Here, we present the experimental realization of a universal near-field interferometer built from three short-pulse single-photon ionization gratings. We observe quantum interference of fast molecular clusters, with a composite de Broglie wavelength as small as 275 fm. Optical ionization gratings are largely independent of the specific internal level structure and are therefore universally applicable to different kinds of nanoparticles, ranging from atoms to clusters, molecules and nanospheres. The interferometer is sensitive to fringe shifts as small as a few nanometers and yet robust against velocity-dependent phase shifts, since the gratings exist only for nanoseconds and form an interferometer in the time domain. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Atomic and Molecular Clusters (physics.atm-clus); Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph)"

This type of singularity can be handled by means of methods designed for structure calculations. It is essentially a consequence of the optical theorem that similar techniques can be applied also in scattering processes. The optical theorem for free particles gives a relation between the effective Hamiltonian and the cross section, a relation that is valid also when bound states are present.

The new procedure is demonstrated for the case of radiative recombination. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

In principle these situations are very far from the wave-particle duality at quantum scale where the wave is probabilistic by nature. Yet some dual characteristics were observed in a system where a macroscopic droplet is guided by a pilot-wave it generates. Here we investigate the behaviour of these entities when confined in a two-dimensional harmonic potential well. A discrete set of stable orbits is observed, in the shape of successive generalized Cassinian-like curves (circles, ovals, lemniscates, trefoils...). Along these specific trajectories, the droplet motion is characterized by a double quantization of the orbit spatial extent and of the angular momentum. We show that these trajectories are intertwined with the dynamical build-up of central wave-field modes. These dual self-organized modes form a basis of eigenstates on which more complex motions are naturally decomposed. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

These conditions have the form of inequalities for higher-order moments of linear combinations of the mode operators. They enable one to distinguish between all possible kinds of tripartite separability, while the strongest violation of these inequalities is a sufficient condition for genuine tripartite entanglement. We construct Gaussian states for which the violation of our conditions grows exponentially with the order of the moments of the mode operators. By going beyond second moments, our conditions are expected to be useful as well for the detection of tripartite entanglement of non-Gaussian states. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

In this paper, which is the first part in a series on the topic, the quantum basis of OCT first order correlations is expressed in terms of full field quantization.

Photons and the electromagnetic (EM) field are described in terms of quantum harmonic oscillators.

In particular, ranging errors are discussed (with remedies) from vacuum fluctuations through the detector port, photon counting errors, and position probability amplitude uncertainty.

These pure states are coherent superpositions of particles and antiparticles, while the existence of positive WF exclusive composed of particles is conjectured. These observations challenge a common belief that states with positive WF are classical or have classical analogues, and may open new venues in relativistic quantum information. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.1820;Path integral Monte Carlo on a lattice: extended states; Mark O'Callaghan,  Bruce N. Miller;  The equilibrium properties of a single quantum particle (qp) interacting with a classical gas for a wide range of temperatures that explore the system's behavior in the classical as well as in the quantum regime is investigated. Both the quantum particle and atoms are restricted to the sites of a one-dimensional lattice. A path-integral formalism is developed within the context of the canonical ensemble in which the quantum particle is represented by a closed, variable-step random walk on the lattice. Monte Carlo methods are employed to determine the system's properties. For the case of a free particle, analytical expressions for the energy, its fluctuations, and the qp-qp correlation function are derived and compared with the Monte Carlo simulations. To test the usefulness of the path integral formalism, the Metropolis algorithm is employed to determine the equilibrium properties of the qp for a periodic interaction potential, forcing the qp to occupy extended states. We consider a striped potential in one dimension, where every other lattice site is occupied by an atom with potential $\epsilon$, and every other lattice site is empty. This potential serves as a stress test for the path integral formalism because of its rapid site-to-site variation. An analytical solution was determined in this case by utilizing Bloch's theorem due to the periodicity of the potential. Comparisons of the potential energy, the total energy, the energy fluctuations and the correlation function are made between the results of the Monte Carlo simulations and the analytical calculations. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

However, it is sensitive to photon loss. In this paper, we discuss the protection of single-photon multi-mode W state with noiseless linear amplification. It is shown that the amplification factor is only decided with the transmission coefficient of the variable fiber beam splitters, and it does not change with the number of the spatial mode. This protocol may be useful in current quantum information processing. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

The efficiency of generating randomness in our protocols are far better than any other proposed protocols certified by CHSH inequality or other non-locality test involving inequalities. Thus, highlighting non-inequality paradox as an important resource for device independent quantum information processing in particular generating true randomness. As a byproduct, we find that the non-local bound of the Cabello's argument with arbitrary dimension is the same as the one achieved in the qubits system. More interestingly, we propose a new dimension witness paradox based on the Cabello's argument, which can be used for constructing semi-device-independent true random numbers generation protocol. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

Such matter-wave interference has been observed for electrons, neutrons, atoms and molecules and it differs from classical wave-physics in that it can even be observed when single particles arrive at the detector one by one. The build-up of such patterns in experiments with electrons has been described as the ""most beautiful experiment in physics"". Here we show how a combination of nanofabrication and nanoimaging methods allows us to record the full two-dimensional build-up of quantum diffraction patterns in real-time for phthalocyanine molecules PcH2 and their tailored derivatives F24PcH2 with a mass of 1298 amu. A laser-controlled micro-evaporation source was used to produce a beam of molecules with the required intensity and coherence and the gratings were machined in 10 nm thick silicon nitride membranes to reduce the effect of van der Waals forces. Wide-field fluorescence microscopy was used to detect the position of each molecule with an accuracy of 10 nm and to reveal the build-up of a deterministic ensemble interference pattern from stochastically arriving and internally hot single molecules.

We consider, respectively, two types of quantum decoherence, i.e., amplitude-damping and depolarizing decoherence, and explore the best von Neumann measurements on one of three qubits of the triple GHZ state for making the amount of entanglement of the collapsed bipartite state be as large as possible. The results indicate that different noises have different impacts on entanglement localization, and that the optimal strategy for reducing a three-qubit GHZ state to a two-qubit one via local measurements and classical communications in the amplitude-damping case is different from that in the noise-free case. We also show that the idea of entanglement localization could be utilized to improve the quality of bipartite entanglement distributing through amplitude-damping channels. These findings might shed a new light on entanglement manipulations and transformations. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

A simple explanation of this phenomenon may be provided by using the concept of hidden entanglement, which signals the presence of entanglement that may be recovered without the help of nonlocal operations. Here we discuss the link between hidden entanglement and the (non-Markovian) flow of classical information between the system and the environment. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.1972;Constraints on determinism: Bell versus Conway-Kochen; Eric Cator,  Klaas Landsman;  Bell's Theorem from 1964 and the (Strong) Free Will Theorem of Conway and Kochen from 2009 both exclude deterministic hidden variable theories (or, in modern parlance, `ontological models') that are compatible with some small fragment of quantum mechanics, admit `free' settings of the archetypal Alice & Bob experiment, and satisfy a locality condition called Parameter Independence. We clarify the relationship between these theorems by giving reformulations of both that exactly pinpoint their resemblance and their differences. Our reformulation imposes determinism in what we see as the only consistent way, in which the `ontological state' initially determines both the settings and the outcome of the experiment. The usual status of the settings as `free' parameters is subsequently recovered from independence assumptions on the pertinent (random) variables. Our reformulation also clarifies the role of the settings in Bell's later generalization of his theorem to stochastic hidden variable theories. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.1982;Constructing Entanglers in 2-Players--N-Strategies Quantum Game; Y. Avishai;  In quantum games based on 2-player--$N$-strategies classical games, each player has a quNit (a normalized vector in an $N$-dimensional Hilbert space ${\cal H}_N$) upon which he applies his strategy (a matrix $U \in$ SU(N)). The players draw their payoffs from a state $|\Psi \ra=J^\dagger U_1 \otimes U_2 J|\Psi_0 \ra \in {\cal H}_N \otimes {\cal H}_N $. Here $|\Psi_0 \ra$ and $J$ (both determined by the game's referee) are respectively an {\it unentangled} 2-quNit (pure) state and a unitary operator such that $|\Psi_1 \ra \equiv J|\Psi_0 \ra \in {\cal H}_N \otimes {\cal H}_N$ is {\it partially entangled}. The existence of pure strategy Nash equilibrium in the quantum game is intimately related to the degree of entanglement of $|\Psi_1 \ra$. Hence, it is practical to design the entangler $J=J(\beta)$ to be dependent on a {\it single} real parameter $\beta$ that controls the degree of entanglement of $|\Psi_1 \ra$, such that its von-Neumann entropy $ {\cal S}_N(\beta)$ is continuous and obtains {\it any value} in $[0, \log N]$. Moreover, an efficient control of $ {\cal S}_N(\beta)$ is possible only if $|\Psi_1 \ra$ appears in a Schmidt decomposed form. Designing $J(\beta)$ for $N=2$ is quite standard. Extension to $N>2$ is not obvious, and here we suggest an algorithm to achieve it. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)"

Our protocol is inspired by the fully device-independent quantum key distribution (FDI-QKD) protocol and the measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) protocol. Our protocol only requires the state to be prepared in the two dimensional Hilbert space, which weakens the state preparation assumption in the original MDI-QKD protocol. More interestingly, our protocol can overcome the detection loophole problem in the FDI-QKD protocol, which greatly limits the application of FDI-QKD. Hence our protocol can be implemented with practical optical components. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

The realized experimental approach allows to characterize coincidence patterns for different states without any modifications of the setup. Measurements were carried out with path-entangled and separable states. The dependence of the coincidence pattern on the phase of the interferometer for superposition and separable states was studied.

Surface curvature in the quasi one-dimensional case is related to an unexpected static formation: on one hand the elastic energy has a maximum where surface curvature has a maximum and on the other hand the concentration of the expectation value to find the (quasi-) particle is again where the elastic energy is concentrated, namely where surface curvature has a maximum.

Liu,  H. Thyrrestrup,  E. H. Lee,  J. D. Song,  S. Stobbe,  P. Lodahl;"  A quantum emitter efficiently coupled to a nanophotonic waveguide constitutes a promising system for the realization of single-photon transistors, quantum-logic gates based on giant single-photon nonlinearities, and high bit-rate deterministic single-photon sources. The key figure of merit for such devices is the $\beta$-factor, which is the probability for an emitted single photon to be channeled into a desired waveguide mode. We report on the experimental achievement of $\beta = 98.43 \pm 0.04\%$ for a quantum dot coupled to a photonic-crystal waveguide, corresponding to a single-emitter cooperativity of $\eta = 62.7 \pm 1.5$. This constitutes a nearly ideal photon-matter interface where the quantum dot acts effectively as a 1D ""artificial"" atom, since it interacts almost exclusively with just a single propagating optical mode. The $\beta$-factor is found to be remarkably robust to variations in position and emission wavelength of the quantum dots. Our work demonstrates the extraordinary potential of photonic-crystal waveguides for highly efficient single-photon generation and on-chip photon-photon interaction.

In contrast, we propose an architecture which allows for the merger of a selected qubit pair in a novel long-periodicity superlattice structure consisting of two optical lattices with close-lying periodicity. We numerically optimize the gate time and fidelity, including the effects on neighboring atoms, and in the presence of experimental sources of error. Furthermore, the superlattice architecture induces a differential hyperfine shift, allowing for single-qubit gates. The fastest possible single-qubit gate times, given a maximal tolerable rotation error on the remaining atoms at various values of the lattice wavelengths, are identified. We find that robust single- and two-qubit gates with gate times of a few 100~$\mu$s and with error probabilities $\sim{}10^{-3}$ are possible. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)"

The electromagnetic field is quantized through a normal mode expansion obeying the Maxwell boundary conditions at the material surface. We couple the electron to this photon field and a classical magnetic field in the Dirac equation, to which we apply the unitary Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation in order to generate a non-relativistic approximation of the Hamiltonian to the desired order. We obtain the Schr\""odinger eigenstates of an electron subject to double confinement by a harmonic potential and a classical magnetic field, and then use these within second-order perturbation theory to calculate the spin energy shift that is attributable to the surface-modified quantized field. We find that a pole at the eigenfrequency of a set of generalized Landau transitions gives dominant oscillatory contributions to the energy shift in the limit of tight harmonic confinement in a weak magnetic field, which also make the energy shift preferable to the magnetic moment for a physically meaningful interpretation.

In this regime, special attention has been given to the Dirac equation because the spin-1/2 fermions represent the most frequent building blocks of the molecules and atoms. Motivated by the considerable interest in this equation and its relativistic symmetries (spin and pseudospin) in the presence of solvable potential model, we attempt to obtain the relativistic bound states solution of the Dirac equation with double ring-shaped Kratzer and oscillator potentials under the condition of spin and pseudospin symmetries. The solutions are reported for arbitrary quantum number in a compact form. the analytic bound state energy eigenvalues and the associated upper- and lower-spinor components of two Dirac particles have been found. Several typical numerical results of the relativistic eigenenergies have also been presented. We found that the existence or absence of the ring shaped potential potential has strong effects on the eigenstates of the Kratzer and oscillator particles with a wide band spectrum except for the pseudospin-oscillator particles where there exist a narrow band gap. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)"

For a pure state, it can be understood as the residual entanglement not accounted for by pairwise entanglements between individual qubits. Here we define and evaluate the analogous quantity for three rebits (that is, binary systems in the real-amplitude variant of quantum theory). We find that the resulting formula is the same as in the complex case, except that an overall absolute value sign is missing. As a result, the rebit three-tangle can be negative, expressing the possibility of non-monogamous entanglement in real-amplitude quantum theory (for entanglement based on the convex-roof construction). We then relate the entanglement among three rebits to the entanglement of two qubits, by re-expressing the two-qubit state as a three-rebit state in the ubit model. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

Many interesting quantum models fall into this class including the Transverse field Ising Model (TIM), the Heisenberg model on bipartite graphs, and the bosonic Hubbard model. Here we consider the problem of estimating the ground state energy of a local stoquastic Hamiltonian $H$ with a promise that the ground state of $H$ has a non-negligible correlation with some `guiding' state that admits a concise classical description. A formalized version of this problem called Guided Stoquastic Hamiltonian is shown to be complete for the complexity class MA (a probabilistic analogue of NP). To prove this result we employ the Projection Monte Carlo algorithm with a variable number of walkers. Secondly, we show that the ground state and thermal equilibrium properties of the ferromagnetic TIM can be simulated in polynomial time on a classical probabilistic computer.

By sequential secret sharing we refer to a situation where the dealer is not having all the secrets at the same time, at the beginning of the protocol; however if the dealer wishes to share secrets at subsequent phases she/he can realize it with the help of our protocol. First of all we present our protocol for three parties and later we generalize it for the situation where we have $(n>3)$ parties. Further in a much more realistic situation, we consider the sharing of qubits through two kinds of noisy channels, namely the phase damping channel (PDC) and the amplitude damping channel (ADC). When we carry out the sequential secret sharing in the presence of noise we observe that the fidelity of secret sharing at the $k^{th}$ iteration is independent of the effect of noise at the $(k-1)^{th}$ iteration. In case of ADC we have seen that the average fidelity of secret sharing drops down to $\frac{1}{2}$ which is equivalent to a random guess of the quantum secret. Interestingly, we find that by applying weak measurements one can enhance the average fidelity. This increase of the average fidelity can be achieved with certain trade off with the success probability of the weak measurements. ";Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

An example of information transmission between the spins of the chain coupled by a Heisenberg interaction shows the interest of the horizon of coherence.

On photonic chips, paths are the natural way to encode information. To distribute those high-dimensional quantum states over large distances, transverse spatial modes, like orbital angular momentum (OAM) possessing Laguerre Gauss modes, are favourable as flying information carriers. Here we demonstrate a quantum interface between these two vibrant photonic fields. We create three-dimensional path entanglement between two photons in a non-linear crystal and use a mode sorter as the quantum interface to transfer the entanglement to the OAM degree of freedom. Thus our results show a novel, flexible way to create high-dimensional spatial mode entanglement. Moreover, they pave the way to implement broad complex quantum networks where high-dimensionally entangled states could be distributed over distant photonic chips. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Optics (physics.optics)"

Due to the multi-photon events of coherent states sources, real-life implementations of MDI-QKD protocol must employ decoy states to beat the photon-number-splitting attack. Decoy states for MDI-QKD based on the weak coherent states have been studied recently. In this paper, we propose to perform MDI-QKD protocol with modified coherent states (MCS) sources. We simulate the performance of MDI-QKD with the decoy states based on MCS sources. And our simulation indicates that both the secure-key rate and transmission distance can be improved evidently with MCS sources.The physics behind this improvement is that the probability of multi-photon events of the MCS is lower than that of weak coherent states while at the same time the probability of single-photon is higher. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

The theory we develop is valid for arbitrary bodies, i.e. for any set of temperatures, dielectric and geometrical properties, and describes each body by means of its scattering operators. For the three-body system we provide a closed-form unified expression of the radiative heat transfer and of the Casimir-Lifshitz force (both in and out of thermal equilibrium). This expression is thus first applied to the case of three planar parallel slabs. In this context we discuss the non-additivity of the force at thermal equilibrium, as well as the equilibrium temperature of the intermediate slab as a function of its position between two external slabs having different temperatures. Finally, we consider the force acting on an atom inside a planar cavity. We show that, differently from the equilibrium configuration, the absence of thermal equilibrium admits one or more positions of minima for the atomic potential. While the corresponding atomic potential depths are very small for typical ground state atoms, they may become particularly relevant for Rydberg atoms, becoming a promising tool to produce an atomic trap. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

To leading order the counter terms are determined by the phenomenological plasmon model. The latter is found to be consistent with the low-energy description. The proximity force approximation is recovered in the limit of long correlation length and gives the upper limit for the roughness correction to the Casimir force. The renormalized low-energy theory is insensitive to the high-momentum behavior of the roughness correlation function. Predictions of the improved theory are compared with those of the unrenormalized model and with experiment. The Casimir interaction of interfaces with low levels of roughness is found to be well reproduced by that of flat parallel plates with the measured reflection coefficients at a distance that is slightly less than the mean separation of the rough surfaces.

By stabilizing the relative phase between the two SFWM paths in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer configuration, we are able to produce all four Bell states. These subnatural-linewidth photon pairs with polarization entanglement are ideal quantum information carriers for connecting remote atomic quantum nodes via efficient light-matter interaction in a photon-atom quantum network. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

We put the sphere into spherical cavity inside the infinite dielectric media, then calculate the energy of vacuum fluctuations in the context of the zeta-function approach. The energy for a single atom is obtained by rarefying media. The Casimir-Polder expression for an atom and plate is recovered in the limit of the infinite radius of the sphere. Assuming a finite radius of the sphere, the interaction energy of an atom falls down monotonic as third power of distance between atom and sphere for short distance and as seventh power for large distance from the sphere. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

We make this intuition precise and general by quantifying the difficulty to observe the quantum nature of a superposition of two states that can be distinguished without microscopic accuracy. First, we quantify the distinguishability of any given pair of quantum states with measurement devices lacking microscopic accuracy, i.e. measurements suffering from limited resolution or limited sensitivity. Next, we quantify the required stability that have to be fulfilled by any measurement setup able to distinguish their superposition from a mere mixture. Finally, by establishing a relationship between the stability requirement and the ``macroscopic distinguishability'' of the two superposed states, we demonstrate that indeed, the more distinguishable the states are, the more demanding are the stability requirements. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

We show that finite lattices with oscillatory, PT-symmetric potentials exhibit a new class of PT-symmetry breaking and restoration. We obtain the PT phase diagram as a function of potential periodicity, which also controls the location complex eigenvalues in the lattice spectrum. We show that the sum of PT-potentials with nearby periodicities leads to PT-symmetry restoration, where the system goes from a PT-broken state to a PT-symmetric state as the average loss-gain strength is increased. We discuss the implications of this novel transition for the propagation of a light in an array of coupled waveguides. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Optics (physics.optics)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0009;Teleportation of entanglement over 143 km; Thomas Herbst,  Thomas Scheidl,  Matthias Fink,  Johannes Handsteiner,  Bernhard Wittmann,  Rupert Ursin,  Anton Zeilinger;  As a direct consequence of the no-cloning theorem, the deterministic amplification as in classical communication is impossible for quantum states. This calls for more advanced techniques in a future global quantum network, e.g. for cloud quantum computing. A unique solution is the teleportation of an entangled state, i.e. entanglement swapping, representing the central resource to relay entanglement between distant nodes. Together with entanglement purification and a quantum memory it constitutes a so-called quantum repeater. Since the aforementioned building blocks have been individually demonstrated in laboratory setups only, the applicability of the required technology in real-world scenarios remained to be proven. Here we present a free-space entanglement-swapping experiment between the Canary Islands of La Palma and Tenerife, verifying the presence of quantum entanglement between two previously independent photons separated by 143 km. We obtained an expectation value for the entanglement-witness operator, more than 6 standard deviations beyond the classical limit. By consecutive generation of the two required photon pairs and space-like separation of the relevant measurement events, we also showed the feasibility of the swapping protocol in a long-distance scenario, where the independence of the nodes is highly demanded. Since our results already allow for efficient implementation of entanglement purification, we anticipate our assay to lay the ground for a fully-fledged quantum repeater over a realistic high-loss and even turbulent quantum channel. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Optics (physics.optics)"

This distinct feature provides us a useful way to achieve the c-phase gate on the two resonator qudits with a higher fidelity and a shorter operation time, compared with the previous proposals. The fidelity of our c-phase gate can reach 99.51% within 93 ns. Moreover, our device can be extended easily to construct the three-qudit gates on three resonator qudits, far different from the existing proposals.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0069;Why the Quantitative Condition Fails to Reveal Quantum Adiabaticity; Dafa Li,  Man-Hong Yung;  The quantitative adiabatic condition (QAC), or quantitative condition, is a convenient (a priori) tool for estimating the adiabaticity of quantum evolutions. However, the range of the applicability of QAC is not well understood. It has been shown that QAC can become insufficient for guaranteeing the validity of the adiabatic approximation, but under what conditions the QAC would become necessary has become controversial. Furthermore, it is believed that the inability for the QAC to reveal quantum adiabaticity is due to induced resonant transitions. However, it is not clear how to quantify these transitions in general. Here we present a progress to this problem by finding an exact relation that can reveal how transition amplitudes are related to QAC directly. As a posteriori condition for quantum adiabaticity, our result is universally applicable to any (nondegenerate) quantum system and gives a clear picture on how QAC could become insufficient or unnecessary for the adiabatic approximation, which is a problem that has gained considerable interest in the literature in recent years. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0073;Local quanta, unitary inequivalence, and vacuum entanglement; Matias Rodriguez-Vazquez,  Marco del Rey,  Hans Westman,  Juan Leon;  In this work we develop a formalism for describing localised quanta for a real-valued Klein-Gordon field in a one-dimensional box $[0, R]$. We quantise the field using non-stationary local modes which, at some arbitrarily chosen initial time, are completely localised within the left or the right side of the box. In this concrete set-up we directly face the problems inherent to a notion of local field excitations, usually thought of as elementary particles. Specifically, by computing the Bogoliubov coefficients relating local and standard (global) quantizations, we show that the local quantisation yields a Fock space $\mathfrak F^L$ which is unitarily inequivalent to the standard one $\mathfrak F^G$. In spite of this, we find that the local creators and annihilators remain well defined in the global Fock space $\mathfrak F^G$, and so do the local number operators associated to the left and right partitions of the box. We end up with a useful mathematical toolbox to analyse and characterise local features of quantum states in $\mathfrak F^G$. Specifically, an analysis of the global vacuum state $|0_G\rangle\in\mathfrak F^G$ in terms of local number operators shows, as expected, the existence of entanglement between the left and right regions of the box. The local vacuum $|0_L\rangle\in\mathfrak F^L$, on the contrary, has a very different character. It is neither cyclic nor separating and displays no entanglement. Further analysis shows that the global vacuum also exhibits a distribution of local excitations reminiscent, in some respects, of a thermal bath. We discuss how the mathematical tools developed herein may open new ways for the analysis of fundamental problems in local quantum field theory. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)"

The process to make a virtual particle real is described by a weak value of a group velocity: the velocity is requisite for the electric field to give the virtual particle the appropriate changes of both energy and momentum. With the weak value, we approximately estimate the electric current, considering the ballistic transport of the electric carriers. The current shows the quasi-Ohimic with the minimal conductivity of the order of e^2/h per channel. Crossing a certain ballistic time scale, it is brought to obey the Schwinger mechanism. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)"

We model noisy channels by coupling the Markov output to `environment' ancillas, and consider the scenario where the environment is monitored to increase the quantum Fisher information of the output. In this setup we find that the survival of the Heisenberg limit depends on whether the environment receives `which phase' information about the memory system. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0145;Does Chance Hide Necessity ? A Reevaluation of the Debate 'Determinism -  Indeterminism' in the Light of Quantum Mechanics and Probability Theory; Louis Vervoort;  In this PhD thesis the ancient question of determinism ('Does every event have a cause ?') will be re-examined. In the philosophy of science and physics communities the orthodox position states that the physical world is indeterministic: quantum events would have no causes but happen by irreducible chance. Arguably the clearest theorem that leads to this conclusion is Bell's theorem. The commonly accepted 'solution' to the theorem is 'indeterminism', in agreement with the Copenhagen interpretation. Here it is recalled that indeterminism is not really a physical but rather a philosophical hypothesis, and that it has counterintuitive and far-reaching implications. At the same time another solution to Bell's theorem exists, often termed 'superdeterminism' or 'total determinism'. Superdeterminism appears to be a philosophical position that is centuries and probably millennia old: it is for instance Spinoza's determinism. If Bell's theorem has both indeterministic and deterministic solutions, choosing between determinism and indeterminism is a philosophical question, not a matter of physical experimentation, as is widely believed. If it is impossible to use physics for deciding between both positions, it is legitimate to ask which philosophical theories are of help. Here it is argued that probability theory - more precisely the interpretation of probability - is instrumental for advancing the debate. It appears that the hypothesis of determinism allows to answer a series of precise questions from probability theory, while indeterminism remains silent for these questions. From this point of view determinism appears to be the most reasonable assumption, after all. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

Wang,  Li-Tuo Shen,  Chui-Ping Yang,  John M. Martinis,  A. N. Cleland,  Si-Yuan Han;  A quantum system can behave as a wave or as a particle, depending on the experimental arrangement. When for example measuring a photon using a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, the photon acts as a wave if the second beam-splitter is inserted, but as a particle if this beam-splitter is omitted. The decision of whether or not to insert this beam-splitter can be made after the photon has entered the interferometer, as in Wheeler's famous delayed-choice thought experiment. In recent quantum versions of this experiment, this decision is controlled by a quantum ancilla, while the beam splitter is itself still a classical object. Here we propose and realize a variant of the quantum delayed-choice experiment. We configure a superconducting quantum circuit as a Ramsey interferometer, where the element that acts as the first beam-splitter can be put in a quantum superposition of its active and inactive states, as verified by the negative values of its Wigner function. We show that this enables the wave and particle aspects of the system to be observed with a single setup, without involving an ancilla that is not itself a part of the interferometer. We also study the transition of this quantum beam-splitter from a quantum to a classical object due to decoherence, as observed by monitoring the interferometer output. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

In this paper, we map the Schmidt basis and the associated coefficients to quantum circuits to generate random quantum states. We also show that it is possible to adjust the entanglement between subsystems by changing the quantum gates corresponding to the Schmidt coefficients. In this manner, random quantum states with predefined bipartite entanglement amounts can be generated using random Schmidt basis. This provides a technique for generating equivalent quantum states for given weighted graph states, which are very useful in the study of entanglement, quantum computing, and quantum error correction. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Information Theory (cs.IT)"

In the present paper we consider the quantum differential equations resulting from position dependent mass (PDM) particles. We focus on the PDM version of the hyperbolic potential $V(x) = {a}~\text{sech}^2x + {b}~\text{sech}^4x$, which we address analytically with no restrictions on the parameters and the energies. This is the celebrated Manning potential, a double-well widely known in molecular physics, until now not investigated for PDM. We also evaluate the PDM version of the sixth power hyperbolic potential $V(x) = {a}~{\text{sech}^6x}+b~{\text{sech}^4x}$ for which we could find exact expressions under some special settings. Finally, we address a triple-well case $V(x) = {a}~{\text{sech}^6x}+b~{\text{sech}^4x}+c~\text{sech}^2x$ of particular interest for its connection to the new trends in atomtronics. The PDM Schrodinger equations studied in the present paper yield analytical eigenfunctions in terms of local Heun functions in its confluents forms. In all the cases PDM particles are more likely tunneling than ordinary ones. In addition, a merging of eigenstates has been observed when the mass becomes nonuniform. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0313;Fine-grained uncertainty relation under the relativistic motion; Jun Feng,  Yao-Zhong Zhang,  Mark D. Gould,  Heng Fan;  One of the most important features of quantum theory is the uncertainty principle. Amount various uncertainty relations, the profound Fine-Grained Uncertainty Relation (FGUR) is used to distinguish the uncertainty inherent in obtaining any combination of outcomes for different measurements. In this paper, we explore this uncertainty relation in relativistic regime. For observer undergoes an uniform acceleration who immersed in an Unruh thermal bath, we show that the uncertainty bound is dependent on the acceleration parameter and choice of Unruh modes. Dramatically, we find that the measurements in Mutually Unbiased Bases (MUBs), sharing same uncertainty bound in inertial frame, could be distinguished from each other for a noninertial observer. On the other hand, once the Unruh decoherence is prevented by utilizing the cavity, the entanglement could be generated from nonuniform motion. We show that, for the observer restricted in a single rigid cavity, the uncertainty exhibits a periodic evolution with respect to the duration of the acceleration and the uncertainty bounds can be degraded by the entanglement generation during particular epoch. With properly chosen cavity parameters, the uncertainty bounds could be protected. Otherwise, the measurements in different MUBs could be distinguished due to the relativistic motion of cavity. Implications of our results for gravitation and thermodynamics are discussed. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0340;Stochastic Qubits; Abdallah Smida,  Mahmoud Hachemane,  Amel-Hiba Hamici;  A new concept of qubits is given by considering entanglement of ordinary quibits with quantum measuring devices (micro-detectors). They are called stochastic qubits since they are generalized coherent states used in the stochastic (phase space) quantum theory. Entanglement is realized through the coupling of angular momenta $l$ and $\sigma$, where the micro-detector has $l=0,1$ and the qubit spin is $\sigma=1/2$. In both cases, the stochastic qubit has total spin $J=1/2$ and is entangled only when $l=1$. In this case, Stochastic Bell states have been defined and teleportation has been studied. They resemble conventional ones. When the micro-detecors have only two states, Stochastic qudits have rather been used. Here, Stochastic Bell states have also been defined and teleportation is possible for special states only. In the last step of this teleportation, Bob will have to transform the qubit only, or the micro-detector only, to recover Alice state. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.00132;On a possibility to combine the order effect with sequential  reproducibility for quantum measurements; Irina Basieva,  Andrei Khrennikov;  In this paper we study the problem of a possibility to use quantum observables to describe a possible combination of the order effect with sequential reproducibility for quantum measurements. By the order effect we mean a dependence of probability distributions (of measurement results) on the order of measurements. We consider two types of the sequential reproducibility: adjacent reproducibility ($A-A$) and separated reproducibility($A-B-A$). The first one is reproducibility with probability 1 of a result of measurement of some observable $A$ measured twice, one $A$ measurement after the other. The second one, $A-B-A$, is reproducibility with probability 1 of a result of $A$ measurement when another quantum observable $B$ is measured between two $A$'s. Heuristically, it is clear that the second type of reproducibility is complementary to the order effect. We show that, surprisingly, for an important class of quantum observables given by positive operator valued measures (POVMs), this may not be the case. The order effect can coexist with a separated reproducibility as well as adjacent reproducibility for both observables $A$ and $B.$ However, the additional constraint in the form of separated reproducibility of the $B-A-B$ type makes this coexistence impossible. Mathematically, this paper is about the operator algebra for effects composing POVMs. The problem under consideration was motivated by attempts to apply the quantum formalism outside of physics, especially, in cognitive psychology and psychophysics. However, it is also important for foundations of quantum physics as a part of the problem about the structure of sequential quantum measurements. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

Kamp;  In this chapter we will discuss the technology and experimental techniques to realize quantum dot (QD) single photon sources combining high outcoupling efficiencies and highest degrees of non-postselected photon indistinguishability. The system, which is based on ultra low density InAs QDs embedded in a quasi planar single sided microcavity with natural photonic traps is an ideal testbed to study quantum light emission from single QDs. We will discuss the influence of the excitation conditions on the purity of the single photon emission, and in particular on the degree of indistinguishability of the emitted photons. While high purity triggered emission of single photons is observed under all tested excitation conditions, single photon interference effects can be almost vanish in experiments relying on non-resonant pumping into the quantum dot wetting layer. In contrast, we can observe nearly perfect indistinguishability of single photons in resonance fluorescence excitation conditions, which underlines the superiority of this excitation scheme to create photon wave packets close to the Fourier limit. As a first step towards the realization of solid state quantum networks based on quantum dot single photon sources we test the overlap of photons emitted from remote QDs yielding non-postselected interference visibilities on the order of ~40% for quasi resonant excitation. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.00207;Quantum game players can have advantage without discord; Zhaohui Wei,  Shengyu Zhang;"  The last two decades have witnessed a rapid development of quantum information processing, a new paradigm which studies the power and limit of ""quantum advantages"" in various information processing tasks. Problems such as when quantum advantage exists, and if existing, how much it could be, are at a central position of these studies. In a broad class of scenarios, there are, implicitly or explicitly, at least two parties involved, who share a state, and the correlation in this shared state is the key factor to the efficiency under concern. In these scenarios, the shared \emph{entanglement} or \emph{discord} is usually what accounts for quantum advantage. In this paper, we examine a fundamental problem of this nature from the perspective of game theory, a branch of applied mathematics studying selfish behaviors of two or more players. We exhibit a natural zero-sum game, in which the chance for any player to win the game depends only on the ending correlation. We show that in a certain classical equilibrium, a situation in which no player can further increase her payoff by any local classical operation, whoever first uses a quantum computer has a big advantage over its classical opponent. The equilibrium is fair to both players and, as a shared correlation, it does not contain any discord, yet a quantum advantage still exists. This indicates that at least in game theory, the previous notion of discord as a measure of non-classical correlation needs to be reexamined, when there are two players with different objectives.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.00259;Optimal quantum operations at zero energy cost; Giulio Chiribella,  Yuxiang Yang;  Quantum technologies are developing powerful tools to generate and manipulate coherent superpositions of different energy levels. Envisaging a new generation of energy-efficient quantum devices, here we explore how coherence can be manipulated without exchanging energy with the surrounding environment. We start from the task of converting a coherent superposition of energy eigenstates into another. We identify the optimal energy-preserving operations, both in the deterministic and in the probabilistic scenario. We then design a recursive protocol, wherein a branching sequence of energy-preserving filters increases the probability of success while reaching maximum fidelity at each iteration. Building on the recursive protocol, we construct efficient approximations of the optimal fidelity-probability trade-off, by taking coherent superpositions of the different branches generated by probabilistic filtering. The benefits of this construction are illustrated in applications to quantum metrology, quantum cloning, coherent state amplification, and ancilla-driven computation. Finally, we extend our results to transitions where the input state is generally mixed and we apply our findings to the task of purifying quantum coherence. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.00274;A Gradient Descent Approach to Optimal Coherent Quantum LQG Controller  Design; Arash Kh. Sichani,  Igor G. Vladimirov,  Ian R. Petersen;  This paper is concerned with the Coherent Quantum Linear Quadratic Gaussian (CQLQG) control problem of finding a stabilizing measurement-free quantum controller for a quantum plant so as to minimize an infinite-horizon mean square performance index for the fully quantum closed-loop system. In comparison with the observation-actuation structure of classical controllers, the coherent quantum feedback is less invasive to the quantum dynamics and quantum information. Both the plant and the controller are open quantum systems whose dynamic variables satisfy the canonical commutation relations (CCRs) of a quantum harmonic oscillator and are governed by linear quantum stochastic differential equations (QSDEs). In order to correspond to such oscillators, these QSDEs must satisfy physical realizability (PR) conditions, which are organised as quadratic constraints on the controller matrices and reflect the preservation of CCRs in time. The CQLQG problem is a constrained optimization problem for the steady-state quantum covariance matrix of the plant-controller system satisfying an algebraic Lyapunov equation. We propose a gradient descent algorithm equipped with adaptive stepsize selection for the numerical solution of the problem. The algorithm finds a local minimum of the LQG cost over the parameters of the Hamiltonian and coupling operators of a stabilizing PR quantum controller, thus taking the PR constraints into account. A convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm is presented. A numerical example of a locally optimal CQLQG controller design is provided to demonstrate the algorithm performance. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science (cs.CE); Systems and Control (cs.SY); Optimization and Control (math.OC)"

In particular, we investigate the potential of this theoretical approach by its application to compute the emission spectrum of a dissipative system composed by a single quantum dot inside of a semiconductor cavity. We also describe a simple algorithm based on the Green's functions technique for calculating the emission spectrum of the quantum dot as well as of the cavity which can easily be implemented in any numerical linear algebra package. We find that the Green's functions technique demonstrates a better accuracy and efficiency in the calculation of the emission spectrum and it allows to overcome the inherent theoretical difficulties associated to the direct application of the quantum regression theorem approach. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)"

Sanders;  For Doppler-broadened media operating under double-double electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) conditions, we devise a scheme to control and reduce the probe-field group velocity at the center of the second transparency window. We derive numerical and approximate analytical solutions for the width of EIT windows and for the group velocities of the probe field at the two distinct transparency windows, and we show that the group velocities of the probe field can be lowered by judiciously choosing the physical parameters of the system. Our modeling enables us to identify three signal-field strength regimes (with a signal-field strength always higher than the probe-field strength), quantified by the Rabi frequency, for slowing the probe field. These three regimes correspond to a weak signal field, with the probe-field group velocity and transparency window width both smaller for the second window compared to the first window, a medium-strength signal field, with a probe-field group velocity smaller in the second window than in the first window but with larger transparency-window width for the second window, and the strong signal field, with both group velocity and transparency window width larger for the second window. Our scheme exploits the fact that the second transparency window is sensitive to a temperature-controlled signal-field nonlinearity, whereas the first transparency window is insensitive to this nonlinearity. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

We present a theorem that states that, provided that the operator $\hat{\cal O}$ is $Q$-Hermitian, i.e., Hermitian with regard to the proper inner product, the normalized matrix element becomes real and time-develops under a $Q$-Hermitian Hamiltonian for the past and future states selected such that the absolute value of the transition amplitude from the past state to the future state is maximized. Furthermore, we give a possible procedure to formulate the $Q$-Hermitian Hamiltonian in terms of $Q$-Hermitian coordinate and momentum operators, and construct a conserved probability current density. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)"

Busch;  The symmetries associated with discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs) and the flexibilities in controlling their dynamical parameters allow to create a large number of topological phases. An interface in position space, which separates two regions with different topological numbers, can, for example, be effectively modelled using different coin parameters for the walk on either side of the interface. Depending on the neighbouring numbers, this can lead to localized states in one-dimensional configurations and here we carry out a detailed study into the strength of such localized states. We show that it can be related to the amount of entanglement created by the walks, with minima appearing for strong localizations. This feature also persists in the presence of small amounts of $\sigma_x$ (bit flip) noise. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Disordered Systems and Neural Networks (cond-mat.dis-nn); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.00439;Quantum Szilard engines with arbitrary spin; Zekun Zhuang,  Shi-Dong Liang;  The quantum Szilard engine (QSZE) is a conceptual quantum engine for understanding the fundamental physics of quantum thermodynamics and information physics. We generalize the QSZE to an arbitrary spin case, i.e., a spin QSZE (SQSZE), and we systematically study the basic physical properties of both fermion and boson SQSZEs in a low-temperature approximation. We give the analytic formulation of the total work. For the fermion SQSZE, the work might be absorbed from the environment, and the change rate of the work with temperature exhibits periodicity and even-odd oscillation, which is a generalization of a spinless QSZE. It is interesting that the average absorbed work oscillates regularly and periodically in a large-number limit, which implies that the average absorbed work in a fermion SQSZE is neither an intensive quantity nor an extensive quantity. The phase diagrams of both fermion and boson SQSZEs give the SQSZE doing positive or negative work in the parameter space of the temperature and the particle number of the system, but they have different behaviors because the spin degrees of the fermion and the boson play different roles in their configuration states and corresponding statistical properties. The critical temperature of phase transition depends sensitively on the particle number. By using Landauer's erasure principle, we give the erasure work in a thermodynamic cycle, and we define an efficiency (we refer to it as information-work efficiency) to measure the engine's ability of utilizing information to extract work. We also give the conditions under which the maximum extracted work and highest information-work efficiencies for fermion and boson SQSZEs can be achieved. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

For the bipartite dissipative model, an abrupt change of the Berry phase in the parameter space reveals a quantum phase transition and is related to the exceptional points. These results give the basic relationships between the Berry phase and the quantum and topological phase transitions of non-Hermitian systems. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.00470;Two-axis spin squeezing in two cavities; Caifeng Li,  Jingtao Fan,  Lixuan Yu,  Gang Chen,  Tian-Cai Zhang,  Suotang Jia;  Ultracold atoms in an ultrahigh-finesse optical cavity are a powerful platform to produce spin squeezing since photon of cavity mode can induce nonlinear spin-spin interaction and thus generate a one-axis twisting Hamiltonian $H_{\text{OAT}}=qJ_{x}^{2}$, whose corresponding maximal squeezing factor scales as $N^{-2/3}$, where $N$ is the atomic number. On the contrary, for the other two-axis twisting Hamiltonian $H_{\text{TAT}}=q(J_{x}^{2}-J_{y}^{2})$, the maximal squeezing factor scales as $N^{-1}$, approaching the Heisenberg limit. In this paper, inspired by recent experiments of cavity-assisted Raman transitions, we propose a scheme, in which an ensemble of ultracold six-level atoms interacts with two quantized cavity fields and two pairs of Raman lasers, to realize a tunable two-axis spin Hamiltonian $%H=q(J_{x}^{2}+\chi J_{y}^{2})+\omega_{0}J_{z}$. For proper parameters, the above one- and two- axis twisting Hamiltonians are recovered, and the scaling of $N^{-1}$ of the maximal squeezing factor can occur naturally. On the other hand, in the two-axis twisting Hamiltonian, spin squeezing is usually reduced when increasing the effective atomic resonant frequency $\omega_{0}$. Surprisingly, we find that by combined with the dimensionless parameter $\chi(>-1)$, the effective atomic resonant frequency $\omega_{0}$ can enhance spin squeezing largely. These results are benefit for achieving the required spin squeezing in experiments. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.00487;Solutions to the anisotropic quantum Rabi model; Liwei Duan,  Qing-Hu Chen;  In this work, the anisotropic quantum Rabi model with different coupling strengths of the rotating-wave and counter-rotating wave terms is studied by using two kinds of extended coherent states (ECS). By the first kind of ECS, we can derive a so-called $G$-function, by which both the regular and exceptional solutions can be given. The exceptional solution are just corresponding to the crossing points of two energy levels with different parities, so is doubly degenerate. By the second kind of ECS, a general scheme for the eigensolutions is derived analytically in a unified way. The zero-order approximation is just the adiabatic approximation, and the first-order approximation is actually a generalized rotating-wave approximation. The algebraic formulae for the eigensolutions are given explicitly in two approximations. The generalized rotating-wave approximations work well in a wide range of two different coupling strengths and the qubit detunings. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

In addition, the engine operation is analyzed from the perspective of local work and efficiency. The local work definition is generalized for the global changes and the conditions when the global work can be equal or more than the sum of the local works are determined. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.00536;Quantum Tomography Protocols with Positivity are Compressed Sensing  Protocols; Amir Kalev,  Robert L. Kosut,  Ivan H. Deutsch;"  Characterizing complex quantum systems is a vital task in quantum information science. Quantum tomography, the standard tool used for this purpose, uses a well-designed measurement record to reconstruct quantum states and processes. It is, however, notoriously inefficient. Recently, the classical signal reconstruction technique known as ""compressed sensing"" has been ported to quantum information science to overcome this challenge: accurate tomography can be achieved with substantially fewer measurement settings, thereby greatly enhancing the efficiency of quantum tomography. Here we show that compressed sensing tomography of quantum systems is essentially guaranteed by a special property of quantum mechanics itself---that the mathematical objects that describe the system in quantum mechanics are matrices with nonnegative eigenvalues. This result has an impact on the way quantum tomography is understood and implemented. In particular, it implies that the information obtained about a quantum system through compressed sensing methods exhibits a new sense of ""informational completeness."" This has important consequences on the efficiency of data taking for quantum tomography, and enables us to construct informationally complete measurements that are robust to noise and modeling errors. Moreover, our result shows that one can expand the numerical tool-box used in quantum tomography and employ highly efficient algorithms developed to handle large dimensional matrices on a large dimensional Hilbert space. While we mainly present our results in the context of quantum tomography, they apply to the general case of positive semidefinite matrix recovery.

Uskov;  Entanglement can effectively increase communication channel capacity as evidenced by dense coding that predicts a capacity gain of 1 bit when compared to entanglement-free protocols. However, dense coding relies on Bell states and when implemented using photons the capacity gain is bounded by $0.585$ bits due to one's inability to discriminate between the four optically encoded Bell states. In this paper we study the following question: Are there alternative entanglement-assisted protocols that rely only on linear optics, coincidence photon counting and separable single photon input states and at the same time provide a greater capacity gain than $0.585$ bits. We show that besides the Bell states there is a class of bipartite four-mode two-photon entangled states that facilitate an increase in channel capacity. We also discuss how the proposed scheme can be generalized to the case of two-photon $N$-mode entangled states for $N=6,8$. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.00615;Mirror-Field Entanglement in a Microscopic model for Quantum  Optomechanics; Kanupriya Sinha,  Shih-Yuin Lin,  B. L. Hu;  We use a microscopic model, the Mirror-Oscillator-Field (MOF) model proposed by Galley, Behunin and Hu [Phys. Rev. A 87, 043832 (2013)], to describe the quantum entanglement between a mirror's center of mass (CoM) motion and a field. In contrast with the conventional approach where the mirror-field entanglement is understood as arising from the radiation pressure of an optical field inducing the motion of the mirror's CoM, the MOF model incorporates the dynamics of the internal degrees of freedom of the mirror that couple to the optical field directly. The major advantage in this approach is that it provides a self-consistent treatment of the three pertinent subsystems (the mirror's CoM motion, its internal degrees of freedom and the field) including their back-actions on each other, thereby giving a more accurate account of the quantum correlations between the individual subsystems. The optical and the mechanical properties of a mirror arising from its dynamical interaction with a quantum field are obtained without imposing any boundary conditions on the field additionally, as is done in the conventional way. As one of the new physical features that arise from this self-consistent treatment of the coupled optics and mechanics behavior we observe a coherent transfer of quantum correlations from the field to the mirror via its internal degrees of freedom. We find the quantum entanglement between the optical field and the mirror's center of mass motion upon coarse-graining over the internal degree of freedom. Further, we show that in certain parameter regimes the mirror-field entanglement is enhanced when the field interacts resonantly with the mirror's internal degree of freedom, a new result which highlights the importance of including the internal structure of the mirror in quantum optomechanical studies. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

Such a code with stabilizer structure, which we call an ""ambiguous stabilizer code"" (ASC), can nevertheless be useful for the characterization of quantum dynamics (CQD). The use of ASCs can help lower the size of CQD probe states used, but at the cost of increased number of operations. ";Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

The intended audience is general computer science audience. The uncertainty principle asserts a limit to the precision with which position x and momentum p of a particle can be known simultaneously. You may know the probability distributions of x and p individually but the joint distribution makes no physical sense. Yet Wigner exhibited such a joint distribution f(x,p). There was, however, a little trouble with it: some of its values were negative. Nevertheless Wigner's discovery attracted attention and found applications. There are other joint distribution, all with negative values, which produce the correct marginal distributions of x and p. But only Wigner's distribution produces the correct marginal distributions for all linear combinations of position and momentum. We offer a simple proof of the uniqueness and discuss related issues. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

This paper investigates how the violation of assumption (3) affects gradient searches for globally optimal control fields. The satisfaction of assumptions (1) and (2) ensures that the control landscape lacks fundamental traps, but certain control constraints can still introduce artificial traps. Proper management of these constraints is an issue of great practical importance for numerical simulations as well as optimization in the laboratory. Using optimal control simulations, we show that constraints on quantities such as the number of control variables, the control duration, and the field strength are potentially severe enough to prevent successful optimization of the objective. For each such constraint, we show that exceeding quantifiable limits can prevent gradient searches from reaching a globally optimal solution. These results demonstrate that careful choice of relevant control parameters helps to eliminate artificial traps and facilitate successful optimization. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

We have demonstrated that our EXIT chart predictions are in line with the Monte-Carlo simulations results. We have also optimized the entanglement-assisted QTC using EXIT charts, which outperforms the existing distance spectra based QTCs. More explicitly, the performance of our optimized QTC is as close as 0.3 dB to the corresponding hashing bound. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Information Theory (cs.IT)"

The angular and radial dependence of the decay rate for different atomic polarizations of an excited atom and also of the energy level shifts are depicted and discussed. The consistency of the present approach in some limiting cases is investigated by comparing the relevant results obtained here to the previously reported results. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.00940;Phase Diagrams of Systems of 2 and 3 levels in the presence of a  Radiation Field; Eduardo Nahmad-Achar,  Sergio Cordero,  Octavio Castaños,  Ramón López-Peña;  We study the structure of the phase diagram for systems consisting of 2- and 3- level particles dipolarly interacting with a 1-mode electromagnetic field, inside a cavity, paying particular attention to the case of a finite number of particles, and showing that the divergences that appear in other treatments are a consequence of the mathematical approximations employed and can be avoided by studying the system in an exact manner quantum-mechanically or via a catastrophe formalism with variational trial states that satisfy the symmetries of the appropriate Hamiltonians. These variational states give an excellent approximation not only to the exact quantum phase space, but also to the energy spectrum and the expectation values of the atomic and field operators. Furthermore, they allow for analytic expressions in many of the cases studied. We find the loci of the transitions in phase space from one phase to the other, and the order of the quantum phase transitions are determined explicitly for each of the configurations, with and without detuning. We also derive the critical exponents for the various systems, and the phase structure at the triple point present in the {\Xi}-configuration of 3-level systems is studied. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

In particular, as an example, we discuss simulation of the chlorosome light-harvesting antenna from green sulfur bacteria with over 250 phonon modes coupled to each electronic state. Furthermore, we propose physical setups that can be used to reproduce the quantum dynamics of a standard and multiple-mode Holstein model. The proposed scheme is based on currently available technology of superconducting circuits consist of flux qubits and quantum oscillators. ";Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

An important part in the answer to those questions lies in scattering theory. The present investigation explores various aspects of inelastic quantum scattering theory for cylindrically symmetric beams with orbital angular momentum. The model system of Coulomb scattering on a hydrogen atom provides the setting to address various open questions: How is momentum transferred? Do vortex beams selectively excite atoms, and how can one employ vortex beams to detect magnetic transitions? The analytical approach presented here provides answers to these questions. OAM transfer is possible, but not through selective excitation; rather, by pre- and post-selection one can filter out the relevant contributions to a specific signal.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.00988;Single-mode nonclassicality criteria via Holstein-Primakoff  transformation; Mehmet Emre Tasgin;"  Recently, two quantifications for nonclassicality of a single-mode field are shown to be equivalent; (i) the rank of entanglement it can generate by a beam-splitter and (ii) the number of terms needed to expand it as superposition of coherent states. We show that nonclassicality criteria can be obtained with an alternative approach. The rank of two-mode entanglement among 2-level identical particles converges to the rank of single-mode nonclassicality within the Holstein-Primakoff transformation, at the large particle number limit. In particular, we show that the entanglement criterion of Hillery & Zubairy converges to the Mandel's $Q$-parameter which is used to reveal nonclassicality, and spin-squeezing criterion of S{\o}rensen et al. converges to single-mode squeezing condition. We obtain additional nonclassicality criteria not existing in the literature. We also discuss if single-mode nonclassicality can be visualized as the entanglement of space generating the photons. Moreover, in a forthcoming study we show that, linear optical response of an optomechanical cavity becomes noncausal above the critical coupling where output single-mode field becomes nonclassical.

Rev. A 89, 052302 (2014)]. We derive a measure for the nonclassicality of a single-mode field using the two-mode inseparability measure of Simon-Peres-Horodecki. Degree of the single-mode nonclassicality requires the knowledge of only $\langle \hat{a}^2\rangle$ and $\langle\hat{a}^\dagger\hat{a}\rangle$. This condition/measure is both a necessary and sufficient condition for Gaussian single-mode states. We show that this measure increases with squeezing strength and display a jump at the critical coupling for a superradiant phase transition. Additionally, we derive a simple analytical condition, $|\langle \hat{a}^2\rangle|>\langle\hat{a}^\dagger\hat{a}\rangle$, for nonclassicality from Duan-Giedke-Cirac-Zoller criterion. In a forthcoming study, we use the derived measure to show the following. Non-causal linear optical response of an optomechanical cavity emerges at the same critical cavity-mechanical coupling where output field becomes nonclassical. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Optics (physics.optics)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01048;On classical finite probability theory as a quantum probability calculus; David Ellerman;"  This paper shows how the classical finite probability theory (with equiprobable outcomes) can be reinterpreted and recast as the quantum probability calculus of a pedagogical or ""toy"" model of quantum mechanics over sets (QM/sets). There have been four previous attempts to develop a quantum-like model with the base field of $\mathbb{C}$ replaced by $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$, but they are all forced into a merely ""modal"" interpretation by requiring the brackets to take values in $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ (1 = possible, 0 = impossible). But the usual QM brackets <{\psi}|{\phi}> give the ""overlap"" between states {\psi} and {\phi}, so for subsets S,T of U, the natural definition is $<S|T>=|S{\cap}T|$. This allows QM/sets to be developed with a full probability calculus that turns out to be the perfectly classical Laplace-Boole finite probability theory. The point is not to clarify finite probability theory but to elucidate quantum mechanics itself by seeing some of its quantum features (e.g., two-slit experiment) in a classical setting.

A critical step in this area is to build an efficient interface between a stationary quantum bit and a flying one. In this chapter, we show how cavity quantum electrodynamics allows us to efficiently interface a single quantum dot with a propagating electromagnetic field. Beyond the well known Purcell factor, we discuss the various parameters that need to be optimized to build such an interface. We then review our recent progresses in terms of fabrication of bright sources of indistinguishable single photons, where a record brightness of 79% is obtained as well as a high degree of indistinguishability of the emitted photons. Symmetrically, optical nonlinearities at the very few photon level are demonstrated, by sending few photon pulses at a quantum dot-cavity device operating in the strong coupling regime. Perspectives and future challenges are briefly discussed. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01070;Optimization of distributed EPR entanglement generated between two  Gaussian fields by the modified steepest descent method; Zhan Shi,  Hendra I. Nurdin;  Recent theoretical investigations on quantum coherent feedback networks have found that with the same pump power, the Einstein-Podolski-Rosen (EPR)-like entanglement generated via a dual nondegenerate optical parametric amplifier (NOPA) system placed in a certain coherent feedback loop is stronger than the EPR-like entangled pairs produced by a single NOPA. In this paper, we present a linear quantum system consisting of two NOPAs and a static linear passive network of optical devices. The network has six inputs and six outputs, among which four outputs and four inputs are connected in a coherent feedback loop with the two NOPAs. This passive network is represented by a $6 \times 6$ complex unitary matrix. A modified steepest descent method is used to find a passive complex unitary matrix at which the entanglement of this dual-NOPA network is locally maximized. Here we choose the matrix corresponding to a dual-NOPA coherent feedback network from our previous work as a starting point for the modified steepest descent algorithm. By decomposing the unitary matrix obtained by the algorithm as the product of so-called two-level unitary matrices, we find an optimized configuration in which the complex matrix is realized by a static optical network made of beam splitters. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Systems and Control (cs.SY)"

A light source is compatible but not necessary in this scheme. Therefor the robustness of the system is effective enhanced. The random bits generation rate of this proof-of-principle system is 0.69 Mbps with double APDs and 0.34 Mbps with single APD. The results indicate that a high-speed RNG chip based on the scheme is potentially available with an integrable APD array. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01111;Quantum coherence and correlations in cold atom systems; Piotr Szańkowski;"  Although the foundations of quantum and classical physics are much different, it is often difficult to pinpoint which features of a particular system are intrinsically ""quantum"". Perhapse, the most clear-cut distinction between ""classical"" and ""quantum"" can be made for systems composed of many particles when the properties of the ensemble are determined by the correlations between the constituents. The issue of grasping the nature of entanglement (i.e. quantum correlations) lies in its formal, discriminative definition: ""if state is not classical then it is entangled"". A possible remedy would be to approach the problem from the utilitarian point of view. The idea is that certain tasks can be performed better when entangled states are used instead of states that are only classically correlated. An example of such task is an entanglement-enhanced interferometer utilizing ensembles of ultra-cold atoms. This line of reasoning leads to the concept of classification of entanglement by the degree of usefulness and allows to relate it to certain well-defined physical properties of the state. The aim of this work is to formalize this abstraction and build upon it an intuitive picture which can help us understand what the entanglement is. ";Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

We show that the power dissipated into field excitations and the associated friction force depend on how the atom is boosted from being initially at rest to a configuration in which it is moving at constant velocity (v) parallel to the planar interface. In addition, we point out that there is a subtle cancellation between the one-photon and part of the two-photon dissipating power, resulting in a leading order contribution to the frictional power which goes as v^4. These results are also confirmed by an alternative calculation of the average radiation force, which scales as v^3. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

In this context, laser-cooled atoms trapped in the evanescent field surrounding the optical nanofiber are of particular interest: They exhibit both long ground-state coherence times and efficient coupling to fiber-guided fields. Here, we demonstrate electromagnetically induced transparency, slow light, and the storage of fiber-guided optical pulses in an ensemble of cold atoms trapped in a nanofiber-based optical lattice. We measure a slow-down of light pulses to group velocities of 50 m/s. Moreover, we store optical pulses at the single photon level and retrieve them on demand in the fiber after 2 microseconds with an overall efficiency of (3.0 +/- 0.4) %.

Varcoe;  Experimental Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols have to consist of not only the unconditionally secure quantum transmission, but also a subsequent classical exchange that enables key reconciliation and error correction. There is a large body of work examining quantum attacks on the quantum channel, but here we begin to examine classical attacks to both the classical communication and the exchange as a whole. Linking together separate secure protocols can unexpectedly leak information to an eavesdropper, even if the components are unconditionally secure in isolation. Here we focus specifically on the join between quantum and classical protocols, finding that in just this crossing of the quantum-classical boundary, some security is always and unintuitively lost. This occurs with no communication between the separate parties. While this particular example applies to only Continuous Variable Quantum Key Distribution (CVQKD), it highlights the need to re-examine the way all individual protocols are actually used. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

We study nonclassical-state generation in a SQ which is driven by a classical field and coupled to a single-mode microwave field. We find that the classical field can induce transitions between two energy levels of the SQs, which either generate or annihilate, in a controllable way, different photon numbers of the cavity field. The effective Hamiltonians of these classical-field-assisted multiphoton processes of the single-mode cavity field are very similar to those for cold ions, confined to a coaxial RF-ion trap and driven by a classical field. We show that arbitrary superpositions of Fock states can be more efficiently generated using these controllable multiphoton transitions, in contrast to the single-photon resonant transition when there is only a SQ-field transverse coupling. The experimental feasibility for different SQs is also discussed. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01272;Monogamy, polygamy, and other properties of entanglement of purification; Shrobona Bagchi,  Arun Kumar Pati;  For bipartite pure and mixed quantum states, in addition to the quantum mutual information, there is another measure of total correlation, namely, the entanglement of purification. We study the monogamy, polygamy, and additivity properties of the entanglement of purification for pure and mixed states. In this paper, we show that, in contrast to the quantum mutual information which is strictly monogamous for any tripartite pure states, the entanglement of purification is polygamous for the same. This shows that there can be genuinely two types of total correlation across any bipartite cross in a pure tripartite state. Furthermore, we find the lower bound and actual values of the entanglement of purification for different classes of tripartite and higher-dimensional bipartite mixed states. Thereafter, we show that if entanglement of purification is not additive on tensor product states, it is actually subadditive. Using these results, we identify some states which are additive on tensor products for entanglement of purification. The implications of these findings on the quantum advantage of dense coding are briefly discussed, whereby we show that for tripartite pure states, it is strictly monogamous and if it is nonadditive, then it is superadditive on tensor product states. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Information Theory (cs.IT)"

Locally indistinguishable sets of $d$ maximally entangled states in a $d\otimes d$ system are systematically constructed for all $d\ge 4$ as an application. Furthermore, by exploiting the fact that local protocols are necessarily separable, we explicitly construct small sets of $k$ locally indistinguishable maximally entangled states with the ratio $k/d$ approaching 3/4. In particular, in a $d\otimes d$ system with even $d\ge 6$, there always exist $d-1$ maximally entangled states that are locally indistinguishable by separable measurements. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

In other words, single-mode nonclassicality emerges when the barrier (in electromagnetism) avoiding faster-than-light communication is lifted off. The nature of the emergence of noncausal behavior does not depend on the length (boundary conditions) and the type of the cavity. Origin of the noncausal behavior is the temporal/frequency relations between the incident and reflected waves at the outer surface of the cavity. We further discuss the relations with the recent studies; (i) equivalence of the entanglement among identical particles to the nonclassicality of their quasiparticle excitations, (ii) necessity of superfluid behavior of vacuum, and (iii) entanglement-wormhole equivalence.

The process is not only capable of creating long-range quantum correlation but the latter remains frozen, when certain weak end-couplings are adiabatically varied below certain thresholds. We term this phenomenon as adiabatic freezing of quantum correlation. We observe that the freezing is robust to moderate thermal fluctuations and is intrinsically related to the cooperative properties of the quantum spin chain. In particular, we find that the energy gap of the system remains frozen for these adiabatic variations, and moreover, considering the end spins as probes, we show that the interval of freezing can detect the anisotropy transition in quantum XY spin chains. Importantly, the adiabatic freezing of long-range quantum correlations can be simulated with contemporary experimental techniques. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)"

In practical experimental realization randomness generation in that scenario is possible only if the efficiency of the detectors used is above a certain threshold. Our analysis shows that the critical detection efficiency is 0.7071 in the symmetric setup, while in the asymmetric setup if one of the bases has perfect critical detection efficiency then the other one can be arbitrarily close to 0. We also analyze the semi-device independent random number generation efficiency based on different averages of guessing probability. To generate more randomness, the proper averaging method should be applied. Its choice depends on the value of a certain dimension witness. More importantly, the general analytical relationship between the maximal average guessing probability and dimension witness is given. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

Such a device will also enable (and to some extent has already enabled) novel experiments in fundamental physics (e.g., [4-7]). Here we report on the trapping and maintenance of spatial coherence of atoms (in a Bose-Einstein Condensate -- BEC) about 5$\mu$m from a room temperature surface, reducing significantly the distance previously achieved between the spatially coherent atoms and their classical environment [8-12], and most importantly entering the regime where atomic circuits are enabled. In addition, we enter the interesting regime in which the distance to the surface is much smaller than the probed coherence length, a regime in which the spatial dephasing reaches its maximal rate. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph)"

Rønnow,  Matthias Troyer,  Daniel Lidar;  The availability of quantum annealing devices with hundreds of qubits has made the experimental demonstration of a quantum speedup for optimization problems a coveted, albeit elusive goal. Going beyond earlier studies of random Ising problems, here we introduce a method to construct a set of frustrated Ising-model optimization problems with tunable hardness. We study the performance of a D-Wave Two device (DW2) with up to 503 qubits on these problems and compare it to a suite of classical algorithms, including a highly optimized algorithm designed to compete directly with the DW2. The problems are generated around predetermined ground-state configurations, called planted solutions, which makes them particularly suitable for benchmarking purposes. The problem set exhibits properties familiar from constraint satisfaction (SAT) problems, such as a peak in the typical hardness of the problems, determined by a tunable clause density parameter. We bound the hardness regime where the DW2 device either does not or might exhibit a quantum speedup for our problem set. While we do not find evidence for a speedup for the hardest and most frustrated problems in our problem set, we cannot rule out that a speedup might exist for some of the easier, less frustrated problems. Our empirical findings pertain to the specific D-Wave processor and problem set we studied and leave open the possibility that future processors might exhibit a quantum speedup on the same problem set. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)"

This approach generalizes to the domain of open quantum walks (or quantum Markov chains) the framework introduced by Szegedy for quantizing Markov chains. For the unitary quantum walks formulated in this article, we define the probability and the mean probability of finding the walk at a node, then derive the asymptotic mean probability. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

De Vittorio,  A.

We show that flickering between two states needs to be taken into account to interpret the single-photon emission properties. With post-selection we are able to identify two emitting states: the exciton and the charged exciton (trion), characterized by different lifetimes and different second order correlation functions. Measurements of the second order autocorrelation function at zero delay with post- selection shows a degradation of the single photon emission for CdSe/CdS dot-in-rods in a charged state that we explain by deriving the neutral and charged biexciton quantum yields. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)"

Martinelli,  A. S. Villar,  P. Nussenzveig;  Gaussian quantum states hold special importance in the continuous variable (CV) regime. In quantum information science, the understanding and characterization of central resources such as entanglement may strongly rely on the knowledge of the Gaussian or non-Gaussian character of the quantum state. However, the quantum measurement associated with the spectral photocurrent of light modes consists of a mixture of quadrature observables. Within the framework of two recent papers [Phys. Rev. A 88, 052113 (2013) and Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 200402 (2013)], we address here how the statistics of the spectral photocurrent relates to the character of the Wigner function describing those modes. We show that a Gaussian state can be misidentified as non-Gaussian and vice-versa, a conclusion that forces the adoption of tacit \textit{a priori} assumptions to perform quantum state reconstruction. We experimentally analyze the light beams generated by the optical parametric oscillator (OPO) operating above threshold to show that the data strongly supports the generation of Gaussian states of the field, validating the use of necessary and sufficient criteria to characterize entanglement in this system. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01830;Entropic tests of multipartite nonlocality and state-independent  contextuality; Sadegh Raeisi,  Pawel Kurzynski,  Dagomir Kaszlikowski;  We introduce a multipartite extension of an information-theoretic distance first introduced in [Nature 341, 119 (1989)]. We use this new distance to derive entropic tests of multipartite nonlocality for three and for an arbitrary even number of qubits as well as a test of state-independent contextuality. In addition, we re-derive the tripartite Mermin inequality and a state-independent non-contextuality inequality by Cabello [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 210401 (2008)]. This suggests that the information-theoretic distance approach to multipartite nonlocality and state-independent contextuality can provide a more general treatment of nonclassical correlations than the orthodox approach based on correlation functions. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01870;Normal form decomposition for Gaussian-to-Gaussian superoperators; Giacomo De Palma,  Andrea Mari,  Vittorio Giovannetti,  Alexander S. Holevo;  In this paper we explore the set of linear maps sending the set of quantum Gaussian states into itself. These maps are in general not positive, a feature which can be exploited as a test to check whether a given quantum state belongs to the convex hull of Gaussian states (if one of the considered maps sends it into a non positive operator, the above state is certified not to belong to the set). Generalizing a result known to be valid under the assumption of complete positivity, we provide a characterization of these Gaussian-to-Gaussian (not necessarily positive) superoperators in terms of their action on the characteristic function of the inputs. For the special case of one-mode mappings we also show that any Gaussian-to-Gaussian superoperator can be expressed as a concatenation of a phase-space dilatation, followed by the action of a completely positive Gaussian channel, possibly composed with a transposition. While a similar decomposition is shown to fail in the multi-mode scenario, we prove that it still holds at least under the further hypothesis of homogeneous action on the covariance matrix. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01876;Simple conditions constraining the set of quantum correlations; Julio I. de Vicente;  The characterization of the set of quantum correlations in Bell scenarios is a problem of paramount importance for both the foundations of quantum mechanics and quantum information processing in the device-independent scenario. However, a clear-cut (physical or mathematical) characterization of this set remains elusive and many of its properties are still unknown. We provide here simple and general analytical conditions that are necessary for an arbitrary bipartite behaviour to be quantum. Although the conditions are not sufficient, we illustrate the strength and non-triviality of these conditions with a few examples. Moreover, we provide several applications of this result: we prove a quantitative separation of the quantum set from extremal nonlocal no-signaling behaviours in several general scenarios, we provide a relation to obtain Tsirelson bounds for arbitrary Bell inequalities and a construction of Bell expressions whose maximal quantum value is attained by a maximally entangled state of any given dimension. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

One important problem in establishing a high degree of many-body entanglement using optical techniques is the leakage of the system information via the light that creates such entanglement. We propose an all-optical interference-based approach to erase this information. Unwanted atom-light entanglement can be removed by destructive interference of three or more successive atom-light interactions, with only the desired effective atom-atom interaction left. This quantum erasure protocol allows implementation of Heisenberg-limited spin squeezing using coherent light and a cold or warm atomic ensemble. Calculations show that significant improvement in the squeezing exceeding 10 dB is obtained compared to previous methods, and substantial spin squeezing is attainable even under moderate experimental conditions. Our method enables the efficient creation of many-body entangled states with simple setups, and thus is promising for advancing technologies in quantum metrology and quantum information processing. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

In each case the entanglement is tested using appropriate witnesses. We finally present generalizations of these ideas to three- and four-photon entangled states. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

Such a protocol may lead to important applications in practice. Although it has been shown that any PBQC protocol is breakable if the adversaries pre-share an arbitrarily large entangled state, the security of PBQC in the bounded-quantum-storage model is still an open question. In this paper, we study the performance of various PBQC protocols over a lossy channel under the assumption that no entanglement is pre-shared between adversaries. By introducing the decoy state idea, we show that an extended BB84-type PBQC protocol implemented with a weak coherent source and realistic single photon detectors can tolerate an overall loss (including both the channel loss and the detection efficiency) of 13 dB if the intrinsic quantum bit error rate is 1%. We also study a few continuous variable PBQC protocols and show that they suffer from a 3 dB loss limitation. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02030;Quantum Iterative Deepening with an application to the Halting problem; Luís Tarrataca,  Andreas Wichert;"  Classical models of computation traditionally resort to halting schemes in order to enquire about the state of a computation. In such schemes, a computational process is responsible for signalling an end of a calculation by setting a halt bit, which needs to be systematically checked by an observer. The capacity of quantum computational models to operate on a superposition of states requires an alternative approach. From a quantum perspective, any measurement of an equivalent halt qubit would have the potential to inherently interfere with the computation by provoking a random collapse amongst the states. This issue is exacerbated by undecidable problems such as the \textit{Entscheidungsproblem} which require universal computational models, \textit{e.g.} the classical Turing machine, to be able to proceed indefinitely. In this work we present an alternative view of quantum computation based on production system theory in conjunction with Grover's amplitude amplification scheme that allows for (1) a detection of halt states without interfering with the final result of a computation; (2) the possibility of non-terminating computation and (3) an inherent speedup to occur during computations susceptible of parallelization. We discuss how such a strategy can be employed in order to simulate classical Turing machines.

We also apply semidefinite programming methods to obtain $N$-qubit X-states with maximal GM-concurrence for a given purity and to provide an alternative proof of optimality of a recently proposed set of density matrices for the role, the so-called X-MEMS. Furthermore, we introduce a numerical strategy to tailor a quantum operation that converts between any two given density matrices using a relatively small number of Kraus operators. We apply our strategy to design short operator-sum representations for the transformation between any given $N$-qubit mixed state and a corresponding X-MEMS of same purity. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02098;Performance of a quantum annealer on range-limited constraint  satisfaction problems; Andrew D. King,  Trevor Lanting,  Richard Harris;  The performance of a D-Wave Vesuvius quantum annealer was recently compared to a suite of classical algorithms on a class of constraint satisfaction instances based on frustrated loops. However, the construction of these instances leads the maximum coupling strength to increase with problem size. As a result, larger instances are subject to amplified analog control error, and are effectively annealed at higher temperatures in both hardware and software. We generate similar constraint satisfaction instances with limited range of coupling strength and perform a similar comparison to classical algorithms. On these instances the D-Wave Vesuvius processor, run with a fixed 20$\mu$s anneal time, shows a scaling advantage over the software solvers for the hardest regime studied. This scaling advantage opens the possibility of quantum speedup on these problems. Our results support the hypothesis that performance of D-Wave Vesuvius processors is heavily influenced by analog control error, which can be reduced and mitigated as the technology matures. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM)"

First, to quantify how common the phenomenon of Bell violations is; and secondly, to find large Bell violations in order to better understand the possibilities and limitations of this phenomenon.

The former is applicable to short-time weak measurement, while the latter can relax the measurement strength to finite. We find that even in the ""very"" weak limit the result can be essentially different from the one originally proposed by Aharonov, Albert and Vaidman (AAV), in a sense that our result incorporates non-perturbative correction which could be important when the AAV's WV is large. Within the Bayesian framework, we obtain also elegant expressions for finite measurement strength and find that the amplifier's noise in quantum measurement has no effect on the WVs. In particular, we obtain very useful result for homodyne measurement in circuit-QED system, which allows for measuring the real and imaginary parts of the AAV's WV by simply tuning the phase of the local oscillator. This advantage can be exploited as efficient state-tomography technique. ";Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

In addition, the effects of this initial correlation on the maximal evolution speed for the qubit trapped to its stationary coherence state are also explored. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

Under the assumptions that the network Hamiltonian preserves the magnetization and that a fully polarized initial state is taken for the lattice, we obtain a general formula for the average fidelity of the two qubits QST, linking it to the one- and two-particle transfer amplitudes of the spin-excitations among the sites of the lattice. We then apply this formalism to a 1D spin chain with XX-Heisenberg type nearest-neighbour interactions adopting a protocol that is a generalization of the single qubit one proposed in Ref. [Phys. Rev. A 87, 062309 (2013)]. We find that a high-quality two qubit QST can be achieved provided one can control the local fields at sites near the sender and receiver. Under such conditions, we obtain an almost perfect transfer in a time that scales either linearly or, depending on the spin number, quadratically with the length of the chain. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)"

These optimizers, named `D-Wave' chips, promise to solve practical optimization problems potentially faster than conventional `classical' computers. Attempts to quantify the quantum nature of these chips have been met with both excitement and skepticism but have also brought up numerous fundamental questions pertaining to the distinguishability of quantum annealers from their classical thermal counterparts. Here, we propose a general method aimed at answering these, and apply it to experimentally study the D-Wave chip. Inspired by spin-glass theory, we generate optimization problems with a wide spectrum of `classical hardness', which we also define. By investigating the chip's response to classical hardness, we surprisingly find that the chip's performance scales unfavorably as compared to several analogous classical algorithms. We detect, quantify and discuss purely classical effects that possibly mask the quantum behavior of the chip. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Disordered Systems and Neural Networks (cond-mat.dis-nn)"

Interestingly, we find that engineering a non-Markovian environment is detrimental to the efficiency of the dynamical decoupling scheme, leading to a worse coherence preservation. We show that each dynamical decoupling pulse reverses the flow of quantum information and, on this basis, we investigate the connection between dynamical decoupling efficiency and the reservoir spectral density. Finally, in the spirit of reservoir engineering, we investigate the optimum system-reservoir parameters for achieving maximum stationary coherences. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02563;Device-Independent Verifiable Blind Quantum Computation; Michal Hajdušek,  Carlos A. Pérez-Delgado,  Joseph F. Fitzsimons;  As progress on experimental quantum processors continues to advance, the problem of verifying the correct operation of such devices is becoming a pressing concern. The recent discovery of protocols for verifying computation performed by entangled but non-communicating quantum processors holds the promise of certifying the correctness of arbitrary quantum computations in a fully device-independent manner. Unfortunately, all known schemes have prohibitive overhead, with resources scaling as extremely high degree polynomials in the number of gates constituting the computation. Here we present a novel approach based on a combination of verified blind quantum computation and Bell state self-testing. This approach has dramatically reduced overhead, with resources scaling as only $O(m^4\ln m)$ in the number of gates. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Computational Complexity (cs.CC); Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02571;Robustness and device independence of verifiable blind quantum computing; Alexandru Gheorghiu,  Elham Kashefi,  Petros Wallden;  Recent advances in theoretical and experimental quantum computing bring us closer to scalable quantum computing devices. This makes the need for protocols that verify the correct functionality of quantum operations timely and has led to the field of quantum verification. In this paper we address key challenges to make quantum verification protocols applicable to experimental implementations. We prove the robustness of the single server verifiable universal blind quantum computing protocol of Fitzsimons and Kashefi (2012) in the most general scenario. This includes the case where the purification of the deviated input state is in the hands of an adversarial server. The proved robustness property allows the composition of this protocol with a device-independent state tomography protocol that we give, which is based on the rigidity of CHSH games as proposed by Reichardt, Unger and Vazirani (2013). The resulting composite protocol has lower round complexity for the verification of entangled quantum servers with a classical verifier and, as we show, can be made fault tolerant. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

Werner;  We outline a theory of symmetry protected topological phases of one-dimensional quantum walks. We assume spectral gaps around the symmetry-distinguished points +1 and -1, in which only discrete eigenvalues are allowed. The phase classification by integer or binary indices extends the classification known for translation invariant systems in terms of their band structure. However, our theory requires no translation invariance whatsoever, and the indices we define in this general setting are invariant under arbitrary symmetric local perturbations, even those that cannot be continuously contracted to the identity. More precisely we define two indices for every walk, characterizing the behavior far to the right and far to the left, respectively. Their sum is a lower bound on the number of eigenstates at +1 and -1. For a translation invariant system the indices add up to zero, so one of them already characterizes the phase. By joining two bulk phases with different indices we get a walk in which the right and left indices no longer cancel, so the theory predicts bound states at +1 or -1. This is a rigorous statement of bulk-edge correspondence. The results also apply to the Hamiltonian case with a single gap at zero. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)"

Underwood,  Moein Malekakhlagh,  Hakan E. Tureci,  Andrew A. Houck;  The study of light-matter interaction has seen a resurgence in recent years, stimulated by highly controllable, precise, and modular experiments in cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED). The achievement of strong coupling, where the coupling between a single atom and fundamental cavity mode exceeds the decay rates, was a major milestone that opened the doors to a multitude of new investigations. Here we introduce multimode strong coupling (MMSC), where the coupling is comparable to the free spectral range (FSR) of the cavity, i.e. the rate at which a qubit can absorb a photon from the cavity is comparable to the round trip transit rate of a photon in the cavity. We realize, via the circuit QED architecture, the first experiment accessing the MMSC regime, and report remarkably widespread and structured resonance fluorescence, whose origin extends beyond cavity enhancement of sidebands. Our results capture complex multimode, multiphoton processes, and the emergence of ultranarrow linewidths. Beyond the novel phenomena presented here, MMSC opens a major new direction in the exploration of light-matter interactions. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02673;Coherence and measurement in quantum thermodynamics; Philipp Kammerlander,  Janet Anders;"  Thermodynamics is a highly successful macroscopic theory widely used across the natural sciences and for the construction of everyday devices, from car engines and fridges to power plants and solar cells. With thermodynamics predating quantum theory, research now aims to uncover the thermodynamic laws that govern finite size systems which may in addition host quantum effects. Here we identify information processing tasks, the so-called ""projections"", that can only be formulated within the framework of quantum mechanics. We show that the physical realisation of such projections can come with a non-trivial thermodynamic work only for quantum states with coherences. This contrasts with information erasure, first investigated by Landauer, for which a thermodynamic work cost applies for classical and quantum erasure alike. Implications are far-reaching, adding a thermodynamic dimension to measurements performed in quantum thermodynamics experiments, and providing key input for the construction of a future quantum thermodynamic framework. Repercussions are discussed for quantum work fluctuation relations and thermodynamic single-shot approaches. ";Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02677;Robust Calibration of a Universal Single-Qubit Gate-Set via Robust Phase  Estimation; Shelby Kimmel,  Guang Hao Low,  Theodore J. Yoder;  An important step in building a quantum computer is calibrating experimentally implemented quantum gates to produce operations that are close to ideal unitaries. The calibration step involves estimating the systematic errors in gates and then using controls to correct the implementation. Quantum process tomography is a standard technique for estimating these errors, but is both time consuming, (when one only wants to learn a few key parameters), and is usually inaccurate without resources like perfect state preparation and measurement, which might not be available. With the goal of efficiently and accurately estimating specific errors using minimal resources, we develop a parameter estimation technique, which can gauge key systematic parameters (specifically, amplitude and off-resonance errors) in a universal single-qubit gate-set with provable robustness and efficiency. In particular, our estimates achieve the optimal efficiency, Heisenberg scaling, and do so without entanglement and entirely within a single-qubit Hilbert space. Our main theorem making this possible is a robust version of the phase estimation procedure of Higgins et al. [B. L. Higgins, New J. Phys. 11, 073023 (2009)]. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02684;Universal two-qubit interactions, measurement and cooling for quantum  simulation and computing; Eliot Kapit;  By coupling pairs of superconducting qubits through a small Josephson junction with a time-dependent flux bias, we show that arbitrary interactions involving any combination of Pauli matrices can be generated with a small number of drive tones applied through the flux bias of the coupling junction. We then demonstrate that similar (though not fully universal) results can be achieved in capacitively coupled qubits by exploiting the higher energy states of the devices through multi-photon drive signals applied to the qubits' flux degrees of freedom. By using this mechanism to couple a qubit to a detuned resonator, the qubit's rotating frame state can be non-destructively measured along any direction on the Bloch sphere. Finally, we describe how the frequency-converting nature of the couplings can be used to engineer a mechanism analogous to dynamic nuclear polarization in NMR systems, capable of cooling an array of qubits well below the ambient temperature, and outline how higher order interactions, such as local 3-body terms, can be engineered through the same couplings. Our results demonstrate that a programmable quantum simulator for large classes of interacting spin models could be engineered with the same physical hardware. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)"

In this way we can also prove and generalize the results obtained by other authors by means of a gauge-like transformation and its generalization. Such similarity transformations also reveal the connection with pseudo-Hermiticity in a simple and straightforward way. In addition to it we consider the positive and negative eigenvalues of a three-parameter non-Hermitian oscillator. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

On the control  of the spatio-temporal properties of biphoton states; Alexander Büse,  Nora Tischler,  Mathieu L. Juan,  Gabriel Molina-Terriza;  In spontaneous parametric down-conversion photons are known to be created coherently and with equal probability over the entire length of the crystal. Then, there is no particular position in the crystal where a photon pair is created. We make the seemingly contradictory observation that we can control the time delay with the crystal position along the propagation direction. We resolve this contradiction by showing that the spatio-temporal correlations critically affect the temporal properties of the pair of photons, when using a finite detector size. We expect this to have important implications for experiments that require indistinguishable photons. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

Consequently, an attacker can control the spatial mode to break security. We experimentally investigate a standard polarization QKD receiver, and identify sources of efficiency mismatch in its optical scheme. We model a practical intercept-and-resend attack and show that it would break security in most situations. We show experimentally that adding an appropriately chosen spatial filter at the receiver's entrance is an effective countermeasure. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

In particular, the analytical expression of the sixth-order QKE rate kernel is derived for resummation. With higher-order correction terms systematically extracted from higher-order rate kernels, the resummed quantum kinetic expansion (RQKE) approach in the continued fraction form extends the Pade approximation and can fully recover the exact quantum dynamics as the expansion order increases. ;"Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph); Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02806;Bridging the gap between the Jaynes-Cummings and Rabi models using an  intermediate rotating wave approximation; Yimin Wang,  Jing Yan Haw;  We present a novel approach called the intermediate rotating wave approximation (IRWA), which employs a time-averaging method to encapsulate the dynamics of light-matter interaction from strong to ultrastrong coupling regime. In contrast to the ordinary rotating wave approximation, this method addresses the co-rotating and counter-rotating terms separately to trace their physical consequences individually, and thus establishes the continuity between the Jaynes-Cummings model and the quantum Rabi model. We investigate IRWA in near resonance and large detuning cases. Our IRWA not only agrees well with both models in their respective coupling strengths, but also offers a good explanation for their differences. ;Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
