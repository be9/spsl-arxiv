https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.0067;Abelian anomaly and neutral pion production; H.L.L. Roberts,  C.D. Roberts,  A. Bashir,  L.X. Gutierrez-Guerrero,  P.C. Tandy;"  We show that in fully-self-consistent treatments of the pion; namely, its static properties and elastic and transition form factors, the asymptotic limit of the product Q^2 G_{\gamma * \gamma \pi ^0}(Q^2), determined a priori by the interaction employed, is not exceeded at any finite value of spacelike momentum transfer. Furthermore, in such a treatment of a vector-vector contact-interaction one obtains a \gamma * \gamma -> \pi ^0 transition form factor that disagrees markedly with all available data. We explain that the contact interaction produces a pion distribution amplitude which is flat and nonvanishing at the endpoints. This amplitude characterises a pointlike pion bound-state. Such a state has the hardest possible form factors; i.e., form factors which become constant at large momentum transfers and hence are in striking disagreement with completed experiments. On the other hand, interactions with QCD-like behaviour produce soft pions, a valence-quark distribution amplitude that vanishes as ~(1-x)^2 for x~1, and results that agree with the bulk of existing data. Our analysis supports a view that the large-Q^2 data obtained by the BaBar Collaboration is not an accurate measure of the \gamma * \gamma -> \pi ^0 form factor.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.0215;Towards a nonequilibrium Green's function description of nuclear  reactions: one-dimensional mean-field dynamics; Arnau Rios (1,2),  Brent Barker (1),  Mark Buchler (1),  Pawel Danielewicz (1) ((1) National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory and Department of Physics and Astronomy, Michigan State University, (2) University of Surrey);  Nonequilibrium Green's function methods allow for an intrinsically consistent description of the evolution of quantal many-body body systems, with inclusion of different types of correlations. In this paper, we focus on the practical developments needed to build a Green's function methodology for nuclear reactions. We start out by considering symmetric collisions of slabs in one dimension within the mean-field approximation. We concentrate on two issues of importance for actual reaction simulations. First, the preparation of the initial state within the same methodology as for the reaction dynamics is demonstrated by an adiabatic switching on of the mean-field interaction, which leads to the mean-field ground state. Second, the importance of the Green's function matrix-elements far away from the spatial diagonal is analyzed by a suitable suppression process that does not significantly affect the evolution of the elements close to the diagonal. The relative lack of importance of the far-away elements is tied to system expansion. We also examine the evolution of the Wigner function and verify quantitatively that erasing of the off-diagonal elements corresponds to averaging out of the momentum-space details in the Wigner function. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.0506;Recombination in nuclear collisions; Rudolph C. Hwa;  Recombination is a hadronization process that converts partons to hadrons at late time, but the description has no quantitative significance without some meaningful input on the parton distributions at earlier time. Thus observations of particle spectra and correlations have definitive implications on the partonic processes at all transverse momenta. After presenting a general review of the subject at the Workshop, I selected two topics in nuclear collisions for more detailed discussion, which are summarized here. One is on the azimuthal anisotropy at low $p_T$ due to hard or semihard scattering of partons that create ridges with or without triggers. The ridge particles are the products of recombination of thermal partons enhanced by the energy loss of hard or semihard partons. Their $\phi$ dependence at midrapidity can be determined essentially from geometry. The other topic is on the scaling behavior in $\phi$ and centrality at high $p_T$, where the hadronization process is dominated by TS and SS recombination. The relevant RHIC data are found to have the same scaling behavior. But at LHC such scaling is badly broken at $p_T \sim 10$ GeV/c if two-jet recombination is important. At the end of this article some comments are made to relate our study of the effects of semihard partons to the observation of minijets in the analyses of STAR data. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.0520;Coupled-channels density-matrix approach to low-energy nuclear reaction  dynamics; Alexis Diaz-Torres;  Atomic nuclei are complex, quantum many-body systems whose structure manifests itself through intrinsic quantum states associated with different excitation modes or degrees of freedom. Collective modes (vibration and/or rotation) dominate at low energy (near the ground-state). The associated states are usually employed, within a truncated model space, as a basis in (coherent) coupled channels approaches to low-energy reaction dynamics. However, excluded states can be essential, and their effects on the open (nuclear) system dynamics are usually treated through complex potentials. Is this a complete description of open system dynamics? Does it include effects of quantum decoherence? Can decoherence be manifested in reaction observables? In this contribution, I discuss these issues and the main ideas of a coupled-channels density-matrix approach that makes it possible to quantify the role and importance of quantum decoherence in low-energy nuclear reaction dynamics. Topical applications, which refer to understanding the astrophysically important collision $^{12}$C + $^{12}$C and achieving a unified quantum dynamical description of relevant reaction processes of weakly-bound nuclei, are highlighted. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.0573;Enhancement of sub-barrier fusion of two-neutron halo nuclei; P. R. S. Gomes,  L. F. Canto,  J. Lubian,  M. S. Hussein;  The tunneling of composite systems, where breakup may occur during the barrier penetration process is considered in connection with the fusion of halo-like radioactive, neutron- and proton-rich nuclei on heavy targets. The large amount of recent and new data clearly indicates that breakup hinders the fusion at near and below the Coulomb barrier energies. However, clear evidence for the halo enhancements, seems to over ride the breakup hindrance at lower energies, owing, to a large extent, to the extended matter density distribution. In particular we report here that at sub-barrier energies the fusion cross section of the Borromean two-neutron halo nucleus $^{6}$He with the actinide nucleus $^{238}$U is significantly enhanced compared to the fusion of a no-halo $^{6}$He. This conclusion differs from that of the original work, where it was claimed that no such enhancement ensues. This sub-barrier fusion enhancement was also observed in the $^{6}$He + $^{209}$% Bi system. The role of the corresponding easily excitable low lying dipole pygmy resonance in these systems is therefore significant. The consequence of this overall enhanced fusion of halo nuclei at sub-barrier energies, on stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis is evident. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.0624;Exploration of a modified density dependence in the Skyrme functional; J. Erler,  P. Klüpfel,  P.-G. Reinhard;  A variant of the basic Skyrme-Hartree-Fock (SHF) functional is considered dealing with a new form of density dependence. It employs only integer powers and thus will allow a more sound basis for projection schemes (particle number, angular momentum). We optimize the new functional with exactly the same adjustment strategy as used in an earlier study with a standard Skyrme functional. This allows direct comparisons of the performance of the new functional relative to the standard one. We discuss various observables: bulk properties of finite nuclei, nuclear matter, giant resonances, super-heavy elements, and energy systematics. The new functional performs at least as well as the standard one, but offers a wider range of applicability (e.g. for projection) and more flexibility in the regime of high densities. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

Birse;  Distorted-wave methods are used to remove the effects of one- and two-pion exchange up to order Q^3 from the empirical 1P1 phase shift. The one divergence that arises can be renormalised using an order-Q^2 counterterm which is provided by the (Weinberg) power counting appropriate to the effective field theory for this channel. The residual interaction is used to estimate the scale of the underlying physics. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.0701;Indications of early thermalization in relativistic heavy-ion collisions; Piotr Bozek,  Iwona Wyskiel-Piekarska;  The directed flow of particles emitted from the fireball created in a heavy-ion collision is shown to be a very sensitive measure of the pressure equilibration in the first 1 fm/c of the evolution. Performing a 3+1 dimensional relativistic hydrodynamic calculation with nonequilibrated longitudinal and transverse pressures, we show that the directed flow is strongly reduced if the pressure imbalance survives for even a short time. Transverse momentum spectra, elliptic flow and interferometry correlation radii are not very sensitive to this early pressure anisotropy. Comparison with the data points toward a short equilibration time of the order of $0.25$fm/c or less. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.0801;Finite temperature collective modes in a two phase coexistence region of  asymmetric nuclear matter; R. M. Aguirre,  A. L. De Paoli;  The relation between collective modes and the phase transition in low density nuclear matter is examined. The dispersion relations for collective modes in a linear approach are evaluated within a Landau-Fermi liquid scheme by assuming coexisting phases in thermodynamical equilibrium. Temperature and isospin composition are taken as relevant parameters. The in-medium nuclear interaction is taken from a recently proposed density functional model. We found significative modifications in the energy spectrum, within certain range of temperatures and isospin asymmetry, due to the separation of matter into independent phases. We conclude that detailed calculations should not neglect this effect. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

The optimal incident angle for a particle diffusing in the dissipative non-orthogonal environment with various strengths of coupling between the two degrees of freedom is systematically calculated. The optimal diffusion path of the particle in a non-Ohmic damping system is revealed to have a probability to return to the potential valley under the combined influence of the off-diagonal system tensors. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.0899;Current Developments in Nuclear Density Functional Methods; J. Dobaczewski;  Density functional theory (DFT) became a universal approach to compute ground-state and excited configurations of many-electron systems held together by an external one-body potential in condensed-matter, atomic, and molecular physics. At present, the DFT strategy is also intensely studied and applied in the area of nuclear structure. The nuclear DFT, a natural extension of the self-consistent mean-field theory, is a tool of choice for computations of ground-state properties and low-lying excitations of medium-mass and heavy nuclei. Over the past thirty-odd years, a lot of experience was accumulated in implementing, adjusting, and using the density-functional methods in nuclei. This research direction is still extremely actively pursued. In particular, current developments concentrate on (i) attempts to improve the performance and precision delivered by the nuclear density-functional methods, (ii) derivations of density functionals from first principles rooted in the low-energy chromodynamics and effective theories, and (iii) including effects of low-energy correlations and symmetry restoration. In this study, we present an overview of recent results and achievements gained in nuclear density-functional methods. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

The absorption/scattering cross sections are suppressed/enhanced incoherently in the direction of the magnetic fielld, B. The asymmetry is 2-4% at the matter density \rho_0 < \rho_B < 3\rho_0 and temperature T < 40 MeV for B=2 X 10^{17} G. This asymmetry is comparable to the effects owing to parity violation or asymmetric magnetic field topology proposed for the origin of pulsar kicks. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.0985;Description of Pairing correlation in Many-Body finite systems with  density functional theory; Guillaume Hupin,  Denis Lacroix;  Different steps leading to the new functional for pairing based on natural orbitals and occupancies proposed in ref. [D. Lacroix and G. Hupin, arXiv:1003.2860] are carefully analyzed. Properties of quasi-particle states projected onto good particle number are first reviewed. These properties are used (i) to prove the existence of such a functional (ii) to provide an explicit functional through a 1/N expansion starting from the BCS approach (iii) to give a compact form of the functional summing up all orders in the expansion. The functional is benchmarked in the case of the picked fence pairing Hamiltonian where even and odd systems, using blocking technique are studied, at various particle number and coupling strength, with uniform and random single-particle level spacing. In all cases, a very good agreement is found with a deviation inferior to 1% compared to the exact energy. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.1060;Phenomenological study on the $\bar p N\to \bar NNππ$ reactions; Xu Cao,  Bing-Song Zou,  Hu-Shan Xu;  We extend our recent phenomenological study of $pN \to NN\pi\pi$ reactions to the $\bar{p}N \to \bar{N}N\pi\pi$ reactions for anti-proton beam momenta up to 3.0 GeV within an effective Lagrangian approach. The contribution of $N^*(1440)$ with its $N\sigma$ decay mode is found to be dominant at the energies close to threshold for $\bar NN\pi^+\pi^-$ and $\bar NN\pi^0\pi^0$ channels. At higher energies or for $p\bar n\pi^-\pi^-$ and $\bar NN\pi^\pm\pi^0$ channels where $N^*(1440)\to N\sigma$ mode cannot contribute, large contributions from double-$\Delta$, $\Delta(1600) \to N^*(1440)\pi$, $\Delta(1600) \to \Delta\pi$ and $\Delta(1620) \to \Delta\pi$ are found. In the near-threshold region, sizeable contributions from $\Delta \to \Delta\pi$, $\Delta \to N\pi$, $N \to \Delta\pi$ and nucleon pole are also indicated. Although these results are similar to those for $pN\to NN\pi\pi$ reactions, the antinucleon-nucleon collisions are shown to be complementary to the nucleon-nucleon collisions and may even have advantages in some aspects. The PANDA/FAIR experiment is suggested to be an excellent place for studying the properties of relevant $N^*$ and $\Delta^*$ resonances. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.1063;Double pion production in $NN$ and $\bar{N}N$ collisions; Xu Cao,  Bing-Song Zou,  Hu-Shan Xu;  With an effective Lagrangian approach, we give a full analysis on the $NN \to NN\pi\pi$ and $\bar{N}N\to \bar{N}N\pi\pi$ reactions by exploring the roles of various resonances with mass up to 1.72 GeV. We find large contributions from $\Delta$, $N^*(1440)$, $\Delta(1600)$ and $\Delta(1620)$ resonances. Our calculations also indicate sizeable contributions from nucleon poles for the energies close to the threshold. A good description to the existing data of different isospin channels of $NN\to NN\pi\pi$ and $\bar{N}N\to \bar{N}N\pi\pi$ for beam energies up to 2.2 GeV is reached. Our results provide important implications to the ABC effect and guildlines to the future experimental projects at COSY, HADES and HIRFL-CSR. We point out that the \={P}ANDA at FAIR could be an essential place for studying the properties of baryon resonances and the data with baryon and anti-baryon in final states are worth analyzing. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.1172;The quark-hadron phase transition in weakly isospin-asymmetric nuclear  matter; Francesca Sammarruca;  We consider the transition from quark to hadronic matter which may result during the cooling/expansion of the quark-gluon plasma formed in energetic collisions of weakly isospin-asymmetric ions. This transition involves the energy density of u and d quark matter and the one of nearly isospin-symmetric nuclear matter. Within bag models, the former entails knowledge of the bag pressure, a poorly constrained quantity. The bag pressure at high density can be fixed imposing equality of quark and nucleonic energy densities at the (assumed known) transition point. We find this value to be very model dependent. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.1181;Hybrid neutron stars based on a modified PNJL model; David Blaschke,  Jens Berdermann,  Rafal Lastowiecki;  We discuss a three-flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) type quantum field theoretical approach to the quark matter equation of state (EoS) with scalar diquark condensate, isoscalar vector mean field and Kobayashi-Maskawa-'t Hooft (KMT) determinant interaction. While often the diquark and vector meson couplings are considered as free parameters, we will fix them here to their values according to the Fierz transformation of a one-gluon exchange interaction. In order to estimate the effect of a possible change in the vacuum pressure of the gluon sector at finite baryon density we exploit a recent modification of the Polyakov-loop NJL (mPNJL) model which introduces a parametric density dependence of the Polyakov-loop potential also at T=0, thus being relevant for compact star physics. We use a Dirac-Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (DBHF) EoS for the hadronic matter phase and discuss results for mass-radius relationships following from a solution of the TOV equations for such a hybrid EoS in the context of observational constraints from selected objects. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.1196;Equation of State of Structured Matter at Finite Temperature; Toshiki Maruyama,  Nobutoshi Yasutake,  Toshitaka Tatsumi;  We investigate the properties of nuclear matter at the first-order phase transitions such as liquid-gas phase transition and hadron-quark phase transition. As a general feature of the first-order phase transitions of matter consisting of many species of charged particles, there appears a mixed phases with geometrical structures called ``pasta'' due to the balance of the Coulomb repulsion and the surface tension between two phases. The equation of state (EOS) of mixed phase is different from the one obtained by a bulk application of the Gibbs conditions or by the Maxwell construction due to the effects of the non-uniform structure. We show that the charge screening and strong surface tension make the EOS close to that of the Maxwell construction. The thermal effects are elucidated as well as the above finite-size effects. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.1198;Liquid-gas mixed phase in nuclear matter at finite temperature; Toshiki Maruyama,  Toshitaka Tatsumi;  We explore the geometrical structure of Liquid-gas (LG) mixed phase which is relevant to nuclear matter in the crust region of compact stars or supernovae. To get the equation of state (EOS) of the system, the Maxwell construction is found to be applicable to symmetric nuclear matter, where protons and neutrons behave simultaneously. For asymmetric nuclear matter, on the other hand, the phase equilibrium can be obtained by fully solving the Gibbs conditions since the components in the L and G phases are completely different. We also discuss the effects of surface and the Coulomb interaction on the mixed phase. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.1249;Remarks on the non-equilibrium effects and collision dynamics in  heavy-ion collisions; Yogesh K. Vermani,  Mandeep Kaur;  We study the beam energy dependence of equilibration process and space-time characteristics of participant and spectator matter. For this, we simulated the semi-central collisions of $^{40}Ca+ ^{40}Ca$ at incident energies of 400, 600 and 1000 AMeV within the \emph{quantum molecular dynamics} (QMD) approach. Our numerical calculations based on the molecular dynamics approach show that incident energy of the projectile influences the reaction observables drastically. The effect is more visible for transverse expansion of the nuclear matter and transparency behavior. The degree of thermalization of participant matter, however, remains independent of the incident energy. The characteristics of the trajectories followed by the nucleons suffering maximal and minimal binary collisions are also analyzed. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.1260;Observing many body effects on lepton pair production from low mass  enhancement and flow at RHIC and LHC energies; Sabyasachi Ghosh,  Sourav Sarkar,  Jan-e Alam;  The $\rho$ spectral function at finite temperature calculated using the real-time formalism of thermal field theory is used to evaluate the low mass dilepton spectra. The analytic structure of the $\rho$ propagator is studied and contributions to the dilepton yield in the region below the bare $\rho$ peak from the different cuts in the spectral function are discussed. The space-time integrated yield shows significant enhancement in the region below the bare $\rho$ peak in the invariant mass spectra. It is argued that the variation of the inverse slope of the transverse mass ($M_T$) distribution can be used as an efficient tool to predict the presence of two different phases of the matter during the evolution of the system. Sensitivity of the effective temperature obtained from the slopes of the $M_T$ spectra to the medium effects are studied. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.1261;Sensitivity of the Jet Quenching Observables to the Temperature  Dependence of the Energy Loss; Scardina Francesco,  Massimo Di Toro,  Vincenzo Greco;  The quenching of minijet (particles with $p_T>> T, \Lambda_{QCD}$) in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions has been one of the main prediction and discovery at RHIC. We analyze the correlation between different observables like the nuclear modification factor $\Rapt$, the elliptic flow and the ratio of quark to gluon suppressions. We show that the temperature (or entropy density) dependence of the in-medium energy loss strongly affects the relation among these observables. In particular the large elliptic flow and the nearly equal $\Rapt$ of quarks and gluons can be accounted for only if the energy loss occurs mainly around $T_c$ and the $q\leftrightarrow g$ conversion is significant. The use of an equation of state fitted to lattice QCD calculations, slowing down the cooling as $T \to T_c$, seems to contribute to both the enhancement of $v_2$ and the efficiency of the conversion mechanism. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"

Malykh;  The near-threshold 12C (0^+_2) resonance provides unique possibility for fast helium burning in stars, as predicted by Hoyle to explain the observed abundance of elements in the Universe. Properties of this resonance are calculated within the framework of the alpha-cluster model whose two-body and three-body effective potentials are tuned to describe the alpha - alpha scattering data, the energies of the 0^+_1 and 0^+_2 states, and the 0^+_1-state root-mean-square radius. The extremely small width of the 0^+_2 state, the 0_2^+ to 0_1^+ monopole transition matrix element, and transition radius are found in remarkable agreement with the experimental data. The 0^+_2-state structure is described as a system of three alpha-particles oscillating between the ground-state-like configuration and the elongated chain configuration whose probability exceeds 0.9. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.1812;Virial Expansion of the Nuclear Equation of State; Ruslan Magana,  Hua Zhenga,  Aldo Bonasera;  We study the equation of state (EOS) of nuclear matter as function of density. We expand the energy per particle (E/A) of symmetric infinite nuclear matter in powers of the density to take into account 2,3,. . .,N-body forces. New EOS are proposed by fitting ground state properties of nuclear matter (binding energy, compressibility and pressure) and assuming that at high densities a second order phase transition to the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) occurs. The latter phase transition is due to symmetry breaking at high density from nuclear matter (locally color white) to the QGP (globally color white). In the simplest implementation of a second order phase transition we calculate the critical exponent ? by using Landau's theory of phase transition. We find ? = 3. Refining the properties of the EOS near the critical point gives ? = 5 in agreement with experimental results. We also discuss some scenarios for the EOS at finite temperatures. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"

Theoretical calculations are performed within the interacting shell model framework in a large valence space, based on a $^{48}$Ca core which encompasses the full $pf$ shell for the protons and the $0f_{5/2}$, $1p_{3/2}$, $1p_{1/2}$, $0g_{9/2}$ and $1d_{5/2}$ orbits for the neutrons. The effective interaction is based on a G-matrix obtained from a realistic nucleon-nucleon potential whose monopole part is corrected empirically to produce effective single particle energies compatible with the experimental data. We find a good agreement between the theoretical results and the available experimental data. We predict the onset of deformation at different neutron numbers for the various isotopic chains. The maximum collectivity occurs in the chromium isotopes, where the large deformation regime starts already at $N=38$. The shell evolution responsible for the observed shape changes is discussed in detail, in parallel to the situation in the $N=20$ region. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

Bass,  Berndt Müller;  We develop a systematic framework for the study of the initial collision geometry fluctuations in relativistic heavy-ion collisions and investigate how they evolve through different stages of the fireball history and translate into final particle momentum anisotropies. We find in our event-by-event analysis that only the few lowest momentum anisotropy parameters survive after the hydrodynamical evolution of the system. The geometry of the produced medium is found to be affected by the pre-equilibrium evolution of the medium and the thermal smearing of the discretized event-by-event initial conditions, both of which tend to smear out the spatial anisotropies. We find such effects to be more prominent for higher moments than for lower moments. The correlations between odd and even spatial anisotropy parameters during the pre-equilibrium expansion are quantitatively studied and found to be small. Our study provides a theoretical foundation for the understanding of initial state fluctuations and the collective expansion dynamics in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"

At incident velocities above the Fermi velocity, we find that the density dependence of symmetry potential plays a more important role on the double neutron to proton ratio $DR(n/p)$ and the isospin transport ratio $R_i$ than the in-medium nucleon-nucleon cross sections, provided that the latter are constrained to a fixed total NN collision rate. We also explore both $DR(n/p)$ and $R_i$ as a function of the impact parameter. Since the copious production of intermediate mass fragments is a distinguishing feature of intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions, we examine the isospin transport ratios constructed from different groups of fragments. We find that the values of the isospin transport ratios for projectile rapidity fragments with $Z\ge20$ are greater than those constructed from the entire projectile rapidity source. We believe experimental investigations of this phenomenon can be performed. These may provide significant tests of fragmentation time scales predicted by ImQMD calculations. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"

A semi-microscopic model is suggested in which the ab-initio effective pairing interaction is supplemented with a small phenomenological addendum. It involves a parameter which is universal for all medium and heavy nuclei. Calculations for several isotopic and isotonic chains of semi-magic nuclei confirm the relevance of the model. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.2226;Statistical description of complex nuclear phases in supernovae and  proto-neutron stars; Ad. R. Raduta (NIPNE-Bucharest),  F. Gulminelli (LPC-Caen);  We develop a phenomenological statistical model for dilute star matter at finite temperature, in which free nucleons are treated within a mean-field approximation and nuclei are considered to form a loosely interacting cluster gas. Its domain of applicability, that is baryonic densities ranging from about $\rho>10^8$ g $\cdot$ cm$^{-3}$ to normal nuclear density, temperatures between 1 and 20 MeV and proton fractions between 0.5 and 0, make it suitable for the description of baryonic matter produced in supernovae explosions and proto-neutron stars. The first finding is that, contrary to the common belief, the crust-core transition is not first order, and for all subsaturation densities matter can be viewed as a continuous fluid mixture between free nucleons and massive nuclei. As a consequence, the equations of state and the associated observables do not present any discontinuity over the whole thermodynamic range. We further investigate the nuclear matter composition over a wide range of densities and temperatures. At high density and temperature our model accounts for a much larger mass fraction bound in medium nuclei with respect to traditional approaches as Lattimer-Swesty, with sizeable consequences on the thermodynamic quantities. The equations of state agree well with the presently used EOS only at low temperatures and in the homogeneous matter phase, while important differences are present in the crust-core transition region.

In contrast, weakly coupled quark-gluon plasma models have so far failed to describe the observed correlation between these soft and hard observables even for couplings extrapolated to $\alpha_s\sim 0.5$. We show that phenomenological applications of the classical trailing string AdS/CFT holographic solution are furthermore remarkably robust to higher order curvature corrections $\mathcal{O}(1/\lambda^{3/2})$ in type IIB supergravity theories, as well as to worldsheet fluctuation corrections $\mathcal{O}(1/\lambda^{1/2})$ that were not considered previously. We emphasize the importance of future measurements at RHIC and LHC of the correlation between {\em identified} charm and beauty quark hard ($p_T > 10-30$ GeV) jet quenching observables and low transverse momenta ($p_T\le 1$ GeV) bulk elliptic flow observables to further tests the limits of applicability of conformal holography to strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.2304;Radiative energy loss in an anisotropic Quark-Gluon-Plasma; Pradip Roy,  Abhee K. Dutt-Mazumder;  We calculate radiative energy loss of heavy and light quarks in anisotropic medium (static) in first order opacity expansion. Such an anisotropy can result from the initial rapid longitudinal expansion of the matter, created in relativistic heavy ion collisions. Significant dependency of the energy loss on the anisotropy parameter ($\xi$) and the direction of propagation of the partons with respect to the anisotropy axis is found. It is shown that the introduction of early time momentum-space anisotropy can enhance the fractional energy loss in the direction of the anisotropy, whereas it decreases when the parton propagates perpendicular to the direction of the anisotropy. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)"

While the transverse momentum spectra of the ground state Upsilon(1s) are controlled by the initial state Cronin effect, the excited $b\bar b$ states are characterized by the competition between the cold and hot nuclear matter effects and sensitive to the dissociation temperatures determined by the heavy quark potential.

Ruiz Arriola;  The Nucleon-Nucleon One Meson Exchange Potential, its wave functions and related Meson Exchange Currents are analyzed for point-like nucleons. The leading Nc contributions generate a local and energy independent potential which presents 1/r^3 singularities, requiring renormalization. We show how invoking suitable boundary conditions, neutron-proton phase shifts and deuteron properties become largely insensitive to the nucleon substructure and to the vector mesons. Actually, reasonable agreement with low energy data for realistic values of the coupling constants (e.g. SU(3) values) is found. The analysis along similar lines for the Meson Exchange Currents suggests that this renormalization scheme implies tremendous simplifications while complying with exact gauge invariance at any stage of the calculation. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)"

Transport theory supplies a covariant approach valid also at large $\etas$ and at intermediate transverse momentum $p_T$, where deviations from equilibrium is no longer negligible. Such an approach shows that at RHIC energies a temperature dependent $\etas$ enhances significantly the $v_4/v_2^2$ respect to the case of constant $\etas$. Furthermore if NJL chiral dynamics is self-consistently implemented we show that it does not modify the relation between $v_2$ and $\etas$. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"

Skalski;"  We study low energy shape oscillations of negative parity in the first and second (isomeric) minima in actinides. As a main tool we use the phenomenological Woods-Saxon potential with a variety of shape deformations. This allows to include a mixing of various multipolarities when considering oscillations with a fixed $K$ quantum number. The phonon energies are determined either from the collective Hamiltonian with the microscopic-macrocopic energy and cranking mass parameters, or from its simplified version with the constant mass parameters. The results for $K^{\pi}=0^-$,$1^-$ in the first minima are in a reasonable agreement with experimental data, including predicted E1 transitions; the $K^{\pi}=2^-$ energies are systematically overestimated. In the second minimum, as compared to the data for $^{240}$Pu and $^{236}$U, our calculated $K=$1,2 energies are overestimated while the $K=0$ energies are three or more times too large. This signals either a non-collective character of the experimentally assigned $K=0$ states or a serious flaw of the model in the second minimum. More data on the $K=0$, $I^{\pi}=1^-$ collective states in the second minima of other nuclei are necessary to resolve this issue. ";Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

Nunes;  In a coupled-channel model, we explore the effects of coupling between configurations on the radial behavior of the wave function and, in particular, on the spectroscopic factor (SF) and the asymptotic normalization coefficient (ANC). We evaluate the extraction of a SF from the ratio of the ANC of the coupled-channel model to that of a single-particle approximation of the wave function. We perform this study within a core + n collective model, which includes two states of the core that connect by a rotational coupling. To get additional insights, we also use a simplified model that takes a delta function for the coupling potential. Calculations are performed for 11Be. Fair agreement is obtained between the SF inferred from the single-particle approximation and the one obtained within the coupled-channel models. Significant discrepancies are observed only for large coupling strength and/or large admixture, that is, a small SF. This suggests that reliable SFs can be deduced from the wave-function asymptotics when the structure is dominated by one configuration, that is, for a large SF. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"

Our model calculations using \emph{minimum spanning tree} (MST) algorithm and advanced clusterization method namely \emph{simulated annealing clusterization algorithm} (SACA) showed that fragment structure can be realized at an earlier time when spectators contribute significantly toward the fragment production even at such a low incident energy. Comparison of model predictions with experimental data reveals that SACA method can nicely reproduce the fragment charge yields and mean charge of the heaviest fragment. This reflects suitability of SACA method over conventional clusterization techniques to investigate spectator matter fragmentation in low energy domain. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

We find that the configuration-space Monte Carlo method proposed by Cerf and Martin offers a practical computational procedure to carry out the numerical solutions in large-dimensional model spaces. Refitting the global strength of the pairing interaction for 443 neutron pairing gaps in our number-conserving treatment, we find the correction to the pairing correlation energies and pairing gaps to have rms values of 0.6 MeV and 0.12 MeV, respectively. The exact treatment provides a significant improvement in the fit to experimental gaps, although it is partially masked by a larger rms error due to deficiencies in other aspects of the theory such as the mean-field energy functional. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)"

Serber symmetry works with high accuracy for spin triplet states. Wigner SU(4) spin-isospin symmetry with nucleons in the fundamental representation works only for even partial waves exactly as predicted by large Nc limit of QCD with accuracy O(1/Nc^2). This suggests tailoring the very definition of effective interactions to provide a best possible fulfillment of long distance symmetries. With the Vlowk definition Wigner symmetry requires that chiral potentials have low cut-offs (450 MeV). Perturbative saturation of heavy mesonic resonances does not faithfully display the Serber symmetry pattern. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)"

For that case we derive an approximate analytical expression for S(E). We test our result successfully against numerical simulations.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.3426;Non-symmetrized hyperspherical harmonic basis for $A$-bodies; M. Gattobigio,  A. Kievsky,  M. Viviani;"  The use of the hyperspherical harmonic (HH) basis in the description of bound states in an $A$-body system composed by identical particles is normally preceded by a symmetrization procedure in which the statistic of the system is taken into account. This preliminary step is not strictly necessary; the direct use of the HH basis is possible, even if the basis has not a well defined behavior under particle permutations. In fact, after the diagonalization of the Hamiltonian matrix, the eigenvectors reflect the symmetries present in it. They have well defined symmetry under particle permutation and the identification of the physical states is possible, as it will be shown in specific cases. The problem related to the large degeneration of the basis is circumvented by constructing the Hamiltonian matrix as a sum of products of sparse matrices. This particular representation of the Hamiltonian is well suited for a numerical iterative diagonalization, where only the action of the matrix on a vector is needed. As an example we compute bound states for systems with $A=3-6$ particles interacting through a short-range central interaction. We also consider the case in which the potential is restricted to act in relative s-waves with and without the inclusion of the Coulomb potential. This very simple model predicts results in qualitative good agreement with the experimental data and it represents a first step in a project dedicated to the use of the HH basis to describe bound and low energy scattering states in light nuclei.

K. Bogner,  T. Duguet,  R. J. Furnstahl,  B. Gebremariam,  N. Schunck;  In a recent series of papers, Gebremariam, Bogner, and Duguet derived a microscopically based nuclear energy density functional by applying the Density Matrix Expansion (DME) to the Hartree-Fock energy obtained from chiral effective field theory (EFT) two- and three-nucleon interactions. Due to the structure of the chiral interactions, each coupling in the DME functional is given as the sum of a coupling constant arising from zero-range contact interactions and a coupling function of the density arising from the finite-range pion exchanges. Since the contact contributions have essentially the same structure as those entering empirical Skyrme functionals, a microscopically guided Skyrme phenomenology has been suggested in which the contact terms in the DME functional are released for optimization to finite-density observables to capture short-range correlation energy contributions from beyond Hartree-Fock. The present paper is the first attempt to assess the ability of the newly suggested DME functional, which has a much richer set of density dependencies than traditional Skyrme functionals, to generate sensible and stable results for nuclear applications. The results of the first proof-of-principle calculations are given, and numerous practical issues related to the implementation of the new functional in existing Skyrme codes are discussed. Using a restricted singular value decomposition (SVD) optimization procedure, it is found that the new DME functional gives numerically stable results and exhibits a small but systematic reduction of our test $\chi^2$ function compared to standard Skyrme functionals, thus justifying its suitability for future global optimizations and large-scale calculations. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

In order to obtain these conditions we use two different models for the two possible phases, namely the non-linear Walecka model (NLWM) for the hadron matter (also including hyperons) and the MIT bag model for the quark phase. It is shown that the phase transition is very sensitive to the density dependence of the equation of state and the symmetry energy.

The calculations produce collective deformed structures of triaxial nature that encompass nicely the known experimental data. Predictions are made for the (still unknown) N=Z nucleus 108-Xe. The results are interpreted in terms of the competition between the quadrupole correlations enhanced by the pseudo-SU(3) structure of the positive parity orbits and the pairing correlations brought in by the 0h11/2 orbit. We have studied as well the effect of the excitations from the 100-Sn core on our predictions. We show that the backbending in this region is due to the alignment of two particles in the 0h11/2 orbit. In the N=Z case, one neutron and one proton align to J=11 and T=0. In 110-Xe and 112-Xe the alignment begins in the J=10 T=1 channel and it is dominantly of neutron neutron type. Approaching the band termination the alignment of a neutron and a proton to J=11 and T=0 takes over. In a more academic mood, we have explored the role of the isovector and isoscalar pairing correlations on the structure on the yrast bands of 108-Xe and 110-Xe and examined the role of the isovector and isoscalar pairing condensates in these N~Z nuclei. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"

Pearson;  We construct three new Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) mass models, labeled HFB-19, HFB-20, and HFB-21, with unconventional Skyrme forces containing $t_4$ and $t_5$ terms, i.e., density-dependent generalizations of the usual $t_1$ and $t_2$ terms, respectively. The new forces underlying these models are fitted respectively to three different realistic equations of state of neutron matter for which the density dependence of the symmetry energy ranges from the very soft to the very stiff, reflecting thereby our present lack of complete knowledge of the high-density behavior of nuclear matter. All unphysical instabilities of nuclear matter, including the transition to a polarized state in neutron-star matter, are eliminated with the new forces. At the same time the new models fit essentially all the available mass data with rms deviations of 0.58 MeV and give the same high quality fits to measured charge radii that we obtained in earlier models with conventional Skyrme forces. Being constrained by neutron matter, these new mass models, which all give similar extrapolations out to the neutron drip line, are highly appropriate for studies of the $r$-process and the outer crust of neutron stars. Moreover, the underlying forces, labeled BSk19, BSk20 and BSk21, respectively, are well adapted to the study of the inner crust and core of neutron stars. The new family of Skyrme forces thus opens the way to a unified description of all regions of neutron stars. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)"

We consider six low-lying resonances of $^9$Be ($1/2^\pm$, $3/2^\pm$ and $5/2^\pm$) and one resonance of $^9$B ($5/2^-$) to compare with. The properties of the resonances at large distances are decisive for the momentum distributions of the three decaying fragments. Systematic detailed energy correlations of Dalitz plots are presented. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

Ruiz Arriola;  The Skyrme force parameters can be uniquely determined by coarse graining the NN interactions at a characteristic momentum scale. We show how exact Vlowk potentials to second order in momenta are accurately and universally saturated with physical NN scattering threshold parameters at CM momentum scales of about Lambda=250 MeV for the S-waves and Lambda=100 MeV for the P-waves. The pattern of Wigner and Serber symmetries unveiled previously is also saturated at these scales. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)"

St. Louis);  Motivated by the existence of unstable modes of compact stars that eventually grow large, we study the bulk viscosity of dense matter, taking into account non-linear effects arising in the large amplitude regime, where the deviation mu_Delta of the chemical potentials from chemical equilibrium fulfills mu_Delta > T. We find that this supra-thermal bulk viscosity can provide a potential mechanism for saturating unstable modes in compact stars since the viscosity is strongly enhanced. Our study confirms previous results on strange quark matter and shows that the suprathermal enhancement is even stronger in the case of hadronic matter. We also comment on the competition of different weak channels and the presence of suprathermal effects in various color superconducting phases of dense quark matter. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.4276;Colour Confinement and Deformed Baryons in Quantum Chromodynamics; Syed Afsar Abbas;  The confinement of coloured entities in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is traced to colour singletness of the observed entities. This is believed to arise from colour singlet state of quark-antiquark for mesons and a fully colour antisymmetric state for baryons. This demands a spherically symmetric baryon in the ground state. However it is pointed out that a deformed baryon in the ground state has been found to be extremely successful phenomenology. There are convincing experimental supports for a deformed nucleon as well. This means that something has been missed in the fundamental theory. In this paper this problem is traced to a new colour singlet state for baryons which has been missed hitherto and incorporation of which provides a consistent justification of a deformed baryon in the ground state. Interestingly this new colour singlet state is global in nature. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.4283;Charge conservation in RHIC and contributiuons to local parity violation  observables; Soeren Schlichting,  Scott Pratt;  Relativistic heavy ion collisions provide laboratory environments from which one can study the creation of a novel state of matter, the quark gluon plasma. The existence of such a state is postulated to alter the mechanism and evolution of charge production, which then becomes manifest in charge correlations. We study the separation of balancing charges at kinetic freeze-out by analyzing recent result on balancing charge correlations for Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200 {GeV}$. We find that balancing charges are emitted from significantly smaller regions in central collisions compared to peripheral collisions. The results indicate that charge diffusion is small and that the centrality dependence points to a change of the production mechanism. In addition we calculate the contributions from charge-balance correlations to STAR's local parity violation observable. We find that local charge conservation, when combined with elliptic flow, explains much of STAR's measurement. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

The yields of different fragment species, rapidity spectra, and multiplicities of charged particles with charge $3\leq Z \leq 80$ are analyzed at different peripheral geometries employing a soft and a hard equations of state. Fragment productions is found to be quite insensitive towards the choice of nucleon-nucleon cross sections allowing us to constrain nuclear matter compressibility. Comparison of calculated charged particle multiplicities with the experimental data indicates preference for the \emph{soft} nature of nuclear matter. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

Employing a few different definitions commonly used in the literature for uniform nuclear matter, it is seen that the different definitions lead to perceptibly different results for the symmetry coefficients for dilute nuclear matter.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.4534;QCD Critical Points and Their Associated Soft Modes; T. Kunihiro,  Y. Minami,  Z. Zhang;"  The mean-field level calculation shows that the QCD matter can have multiple critical points incorporating the color superconductivity under charge neutrality constraint due to the repulsive vector interaction; this actually implies that the QCD matter is very soft for a simultaneous formation of diquark and chiral condensates coupled with the baryonic density. Dynamical density fluctuations are analyzed as possible soft modes around the QCD critical point using dissipative relativistic fluid dynamics. It is found that the entropy fluctuation solely gets enhanced while the sound modes due to mechanical density fluctuations are strongly attenuated around the QCD CP, which may suggest a suppression or even total disappearance of Mach cone at the CP.

Morais;  Cross sections of $^{120}$Sn($\alpha$,$\alpha$)$^{120}$Sn elastic scattering have been extracted from the $\alpha$ particle beam contamination of a recent $^{120}$Sn($^6$He,$^6$He)$^{120}$Sn experiment. Both reactions are analyzed using systematic double folding potentials in the real part and smoothly varying Woods-Saxon potentials in the imaginary part. The potential extracted from the $^{120}$Sn($^6$He,$^6$He)$^{120}$Sn data may be used as the basis for the construction of a simple global $^6$He optical potential. The comparison of the $^6$He and $\alpha$ data shows that the halo nature of the $^6$He nucleus leads to a clear signature in the reflexion coefficients $\eta_L$: the relevant angular momenta $L$ with $\eta_L \gg 0$ and $\eta_L \ll 1$ are shifted to larger $L$ with a broader distribution. This signature is not present in the $\alpha$ scattering data and can thus be used as a new criterion for the definition of a halo nucleus. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"

Alex Brown,  Morten Hjorth-Jensen;  Neutron-rich isotopes in the sdpf space with Z < 15 require modifications to derived effective interactions to agree with experimental data away from stability. A quantitative justification is given for these modifications due to the weakly bound nature of model space orbits via a procedure using realistic radial wavefunctions and realistic NN interactions. The long tail of the radial wavefunction for loosely bound single particle orbits causes a reduction in the size of matrix elements involving those orbits, most notably for pairing matrix elements, resulting in a more condensed level spacing in shell model calculations. Example calculations are shown for 36Si and 38Si. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.4920;Photon parton distributions in nuclei and the EMC effect; Leonid Frankfurt,  Mark Strikman;  Photons as well as quarks and gluons are constituents of the infinite momentum frame (IMF) wave function of an energetic particle. They are mostly equivalent photons whose amplitude follows from the Lorentz transformation of the particle rest frame Coulomb field into the IMF and from the conservation of the electromagnetic current. We evaluate in a model independent way the dominant photon contribution \propto \alpha_{em}(Z^2/A^{4/3})\ln(1/R_{A}m_{N}x) to the nuclear structure functions as well as the term \propto \alpha_{em}Z/A. In addition we show that the definition of x consistent with the exact kinematics of eA scattering (with exact sum rules) works in the same direction as the nucleus field of equivalent photons. Combined, these effects account for the bulk of the EMC effect for x\le 0.5 where Fermi motion effects are small. In particular for these x the hadronic mechanism contribution to the EMC effect does not exceed \sim 3% for all nuclei. Also the A-dependence of the hadronic mechanism of the EMC effect for x > 0.5 is significantly modified. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

The current data focus on low-spin spectroscopy only, with little information on the states where high-j particles align their spins with the system rotation. By applying the Projected Shell Model, we show that rotation alignment occurs in neutron-rich even-even Cr nuclei as early as spin 8 and, due to shell filling, the aligning particles differ in different isotopes. It is suggested that observation of irregularities in moments of inertia is a direct probe of the deformed single-particle scheme in this exotic mass region. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"

In order to give an adequate consideration of both the contribution of the continuum and the large spatial distribution in exotic nuclei, the deformed RHB equations are solved in a Woods-Saxon (WS) basis in which the radial wave functions have a proper asymptotic behavior at large distance from the nuclear center. This is crucial for the proper description of a possible halo. The formalism of deformed RHB theory in continuum is presented. A stable nucleus, 20Mg and a weakly-bound nucleus, 42Mg, are taken as examples to present numerical details and to carry out necessary numerical checks. In addition, the ground state properties of even-even magnesium isotopes are investigated. The generic conditions of the formation of a halo in weakly bound deformed systems and the shape of the halo in deformed nuclei are discussed. We show that the existence and the deformation of a possible neutron halo depend essentially on the quantum numbers of the main components of the single particle orbitals in the vicinity of the Fermi surface. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"

Using state-of-the-art analysis and visualization tools we demonstrate that each collision event probes QCD matter characterized by a wide range of temperatures and baryo-chemical potentials, making a dynamical response of the system to the vicinity of the critical point very difficult to isolate above the background. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.0208;The multiple-scattering series in pion-deuteron scattering and the  nucleon-nucleon potential: perspectives from effective field theory; V. Baru,  E. Epelbaum,  C. Hanhart,  M. Hoferichter,  A. E. Kudryavtsev,  D. R. Phillips;  Important contributions to meson-nucleus scattering are produced by terms in the multiple-scattering series, which is defined as the sum of all diagrams where the meson scatters back and forth between a pair of static nucleons before leaving the nucleus. In particular, the sum of this series is needed for an accurate description of kaon-deuteron scattering, and appears as part of the nucleon-nucleon potential. In this article we present some effective-field-theory (EFT)-based insights into this series in the case of two-nucleon systems. In particular, we discuss the fact that, if meson-nucleon scattering is approximated by the scattering-length term, individual terms of the series are divergent, and enhanced with respect to the straightforward expectation from chiral perturbation theory ($\chi$PT). This apparently indicates the presence of similarly enhanced counterterms. However, we show that when the series is resummed the divergences cancel, such that no additional information on short-range interactions is needed to obtain predictions for observables after resummation. We discuss the conditions under which this resummation is justified. We show that the same issues arise in the $NN$ potential, where the resummed series produces poles whose appearance indicates the breakdown scale of the $\chi$PT expansion for that quantity. This demonstrates unequivocally that $\chi$PT cannot be applied to compute $V(r)$ for distances smaller than $r \sim 1$ fm at least in the theory without explicit Delta(1232) degrees of freedom. We briefly discuss whether this bound can be lowered if the Delta resonance is included in the EFT as an explicit degree of freedom. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

Our analysis is focused on the kinematical region of neutrino energy larger than ~200MeV, in which single-nucleon knockout is known to be the dominant reaction mechanism. The numerical results have been obtained using a realistic model of the target spectral function, extensively tested against electron-nucleus scattering data. We find that at neutrino energy 600 MeV the fraction of neutral-current interactions leading to emission of gamma-rays of energy larger than 6 MeV is ~41%, and that the contribution of the p_{3/2} state is overwhelming. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

Arai;  There are some discrepancies in the low energy data on the photoabsorption cross section of $^4$He. We calculate the cross section with realistic nuclear forces and explicitly correlated Gaussian functions. Final state interactions and two- and three-body decay channels are taken into account. The cross section is evaluated in two methods: With the complex scaling method the total absorption cross section is obtained up to the rest energy of a pion, and with the microscopic $R$-matrix method both cross sections $^4$He($\gamma, p$)$^3$H and $^4$He($\gamma, n$)$^3$He are calculated below 40\,MeV. Both methods give virtually the same result. The cross section rises sharply from the $^3$H+$p$ threshold, reaching a giant resonance peak at 26--27\,MeV. Our calculation reproduces almost all the data above 30\,MeV. We stress the importance of $^3$H+$p$ and $^3$He+$n$ cluster configurations on the cross section as well as the effect of the one-pion exchange potential on the photonuclear sum rule. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"

Calculations are performed via a hyperspherical harmonics expansion where the convergence is sped up introducing an effective interaction for non-local potentials. The latter is essential to reach a satisfactory convergence of the extended matter radius and of the point-proton radius. The dependence of the results on the resolution scale is studied. A correlation is found between the radii and the two-neutron separation energy. The importance of three-nucleon forces is pointed out comparing our results and previous calculations to experiment. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"

In low energy $\bar p$ annihilations, the hyperons are produced mostly by strangeness exchange mechanisms. Thus, hyperon production in $\bar p A$ interactions is very sensitive to the properties of the antikaon-nucleon interaction in nuclear medium. Within the Giessen Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck transport model (GiBUU), we analyse the experimental data on $\Lambda$ and $K^0_S$ production in $\bar p A$ collisions at $p_{\rm lab}=0.2-4$ GeV/c. A satisfactory overall agreement is reached, except for the $K^0_S$ production in $\bar p+^{20}$Ne collisions at $p_{\rm lab}=608$ MeV/c, where we obtain substantially larger $K^0_S$ production rate. We also study the $\Xi$ hyperon production, important in view of the forthcoming experiments at FAIR and J-PARC. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"

Priyanka;"  Systematic study on {\alpha}-decay fine structure is presented for the first time in the case of odd-even nuclei in the range 83 \leq Z \leq 101. The model used for the study is the recently proposed Coulomb and proximity potential model for deformed nuclei (CPPMDN), which employs deformed Coulomb potential, deformed two term proximity potential and centrifugal potential. The computed partial half lives, total half lives and branching ratios are compared with experimental data and are in good agreement. The standard deviation of partial half-life is 1.08 and that for branching ratio is 1.21. Our formalism is also successful in predicting angular momentum hindered and structure hindered transitions. The present study reveals that CPPMDN is a unified theory which is successful in explaining alpha decay from ground and isomeric state; and alpha fine structure of even-even, even-odd and odd-even nuclei. Our study relights that the differences in the parent and daughter surfaces or the changes in the deformation parameters as well as the shell structure of the parent and daughter nuclei, influences the alpha decay probability.

By implementing the fluctuations via cumulant expansion for various harmonics quantified by $\epsilon_n$ and using the geometric model for jet energy loss, we compute the response $\chi^h_n=v_n/\epsilon_n$. Combining these results with the known hydrodynamic response of the bulk matter expansion in the literature, we show that the hard-soft azimuthal correlation arising from their respective responses to the common geometric fluctuations reveals a robust and narrow near-side peak that may provide the dominant contribution to the ""hard-ridge"" observed in experimental data.

The Fokker Planck equation has been solved to study the dissipation of heavy quarks momentum in QGP. The nuclear suppression factor, $R_{\mathrm AA}$ and the elliptic flow $v_2^{HF}$ of the non-photonic electrons resulting from the semi-leptonic decays of hadrons containing charm and bottom quarks have been evaluated for RHIC and LHC nuclear collision conditions. We find that the observed $R_{\mathrm AA}$ and $v_2$ at RHIC can be reproduced simultaneously within the pQCD framework. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)"

We employ the linear nucleon-meson model with parameters fixed by the zero-temperature properties of nuclear matter close to the liquid-gas quantum phase transition. For the parameter region of interest this yields a reliable picture of the thermodynamic and chiral properties at non-zero temperature. The chemical freeze-out observed in low-energy experiments occurs when baryon densities fall below a critical value of about 15 percent of nuclear density. This region in the phase diagram is far away from any phase transition or rapid crossover. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)"

In applications of time-independent AMD to nuclear structure studies, structures of neutron-rich nuclei such as Be, C, Ne, and Mg isotopes were described focusing on cluster aspects. Important roles of valence neutrons were discussed. The results suggested a variety of cluster structures appear also in unstable nuclei as well as in stable nuclei. Deformation and cluster phenomena in $Z\sim N$ nuclei in $p$- and $sd$- shell regions were also discussed. Applications of time-dependent AMD contain various topics such as fragmentation in heavy-ion collisions as well as nuclear responses. The AMD calculations successfully describe multifragmentation which is one of the remarkable phenomena in heavy-ion collisions. The approach is able to link reactions and nuclear matter properties.

The local two-body potentials describing the interaction of the clusters were determined by fitting scattering data and properties of bound states. The many-body character of the problem is approximatively accounted for by Pauli forbidden states. An important feature of the approach is the consideration of the dependence of the interaction potential between the clusters on the orbital Young schemes, which determine the permutation symmetry of the nucleon system. Proton capture on 2H, 6Li, 7Li, 12C, and 13C was analyzed in this approach. Experimental data at low energies were described reasonably well when the phase shifts for cluster-cluster scattering, extracted from precise data, were used. This shows that decreasing the experimental error on differential elastic scattering cross sections of light nuclei at astrophysical energies is very important also to allow a more accurate phase shift analysis. A future increase in precision will allow more definite conclusions regarding the reaction mechanisms and astrophysical conditions of thermonuclear reactions. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)"

We study such multi-minijet contribution to the hadron spectra and to dihadron correlation in Pb-Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV at LHC. We adjust the parameter controlling the momentum degradation of semihard partons by fitting the charged-particle distribution up to $p_T\sim 16$ GeV/c. The relative magnitudes of different identified hadrons and of various partonic components are fixed by the recombination formalism. We find that the coalescence of shower patons from adjacent miniijets can be as much as from single jets for meson production, and even more so for proton, but never dominant over other components. In 3-shower-parton recombination the ratio of 2-jet to 1-jet contributions increases with collision energy; its maximum can exceed 2 at 5.5 TeV.

The latter, able to describe lattice QCD thermodynamics, implies a ""chemical"" equilibrium ratio between quarks and gluons strongly increasing as $T\rightarrow T_c$, the phase transition temperature. Accordingly we see in realistic simulations of uRHIC's a rapid evolution from a gluon dominated initial state to a quark dominated plasma close to $T_c$. The quark to gluon ratio can be modified by about a factor of $\sim 20$ in the bulk of the system and appears to be large also in the high $p_T$ region. We discuss how this aspect, often overflown, can be important for a quantitative study of several key issues in the QGP physics: shear viscosity, jet quenching, quarkonia suppression. Furthermore a bulk plasma made by more than $80\%$ of quarks plus antiquarks provides a theoretical basis for hadronization via quark coalescence.

For progenitors stars with masses above about 25 solar masses, which eventually form a black hole, the temperatures and densities reached during the collapse are so high that a traditional description in terms of electrons, nuclei, and nucleons is no longer adequate. We present here an improved equation of state which contains in addition pions and hyperons. They become abundant in the high temperature and density regime. We study the different constraints on such an equation of state, coming from both hyperonic data and observations of neutron star properties. In order to test the zero-temperature versions, we perform numerical simulations of the collapse of a neutron star with such additional particles to a black hole. We discuss the influence of the additional particles on the thermodynamic properties within the hot versions of the equation of state and we show that in regimes relevant to core-collapse and black hole formation, the effects of pions and hyperons on pressure, internal energy and sound speed are not negligible. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.2681;Pairing dynamics in particle transport; G. Scamps,  D. Lacroix,  G. F. Bertsch,  K. Washiyama;  We analyze the effect of pairing on particle transport in time-dependent theories based on the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) or BCS approximations. The equations of motion for the HFB density matrices are unique and the theory respects the usual conservation laws defined by commutators of the conserved quantity with the Hamiltonian. In contrast, the theories based on the BCS approximation are more problematic. In the usual formulation of TDHF+BCS, the equation of continuity is violated and one sees unphysical oscillations in particle densities. This can be ameliorated by freezing the occupation numbers during the evolution in TDHF+BCS, but there are other problems with the BCS that make it doubtful for reaction dynamics. We also compare different numerical implementations of the time-dependent HFB equations. The equations of motion for the $U$ and $V$ Bogoliubov transformations are not unique, but it appears that the usual formulation is also the most efficient. Finally, we compare the time-dependent HFB solutions with numerically exact solutions of the two-particle Schrodinger equation. Depending on the treatment of the initial state, the HFB dynamics produces a particle emission rate at short times similar to that of the Schrodinger equation. At long times, the total particle emission can be quite different, due to inherent mean-field approximation of the HFB theory. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"

We use seven high-quality fits based on potentials with different forms as a measure of the systematic uncertainty. We represent the interaction as a sum of delta-shells in configuration space below the 3fm and a charge dependent one pion exchange potential above 3fm together with magnetic and vacuum polarization effects.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.2720;Electromagnetic Transition Strengths in Heavy Nuclei; B.Buck,  A. C. Merchant,  S. M. Perez;  We calculate reduced B(E2) and B(M1) electromagnetic transition strengths within and between K-bands in support of a recently proposed model for the structure of heavy nuclei. Previously, only spectra and a rough indication of the largest B(E2) strengths were reported. The present more detailed calculations should aid the experimental identification of the predicted $0^+$, $1^+$ and $2^+$ bands and, in particular, act to confirm or refute the suggestion that the model $0^+$ and $2^+$ bands correspond to the well known and widespread beta and gamma bands. Furthermore they pinpoint transitions which can indicate the presence of a so far elusive $1^+$ band by feeding relatively strongly into or out of it. Some of these transitions may already have been measured in $^{230}$Th, $^{232}$Th and $^{238}$U. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.2795;Relation between Wigner energy and proton-neutron pairing; I. Bentley,  S. Frauendorf;  The linear term proportional to $|N-Z|$ in the nuclear symmetry energy (Wigner energy)is obtained in a model that uses isovector pairing on single particle levels from a deformed potential combined with a $\vec T^2$ interaction. The pairing correlations are calculated by numerical diagonalization of the pairing Hamiltonian acting on the six or seven levels nearest the $N=Z$ Fermi surface. The experimental binding energies of nuclei with $N\approx Z$ are well reproduced. The Wigner energy emerges as a consequence of restoring isospin symmetry. We have found the Wigner energy to be insensitive to the presence of moderate isoscalar pair correlations. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

In the usual case where many matrix elements should be calculated, this computation can be transformed into a multiplication of dense matrices. It is demonstrated that the present method based on the matrix-matrix multiplication attains $\sim$80% of the theoretical peak performance measured on systems equipped with modern microprocessors, a factor of 5-10 better than the normal method using indirectly indexed arrays to treat a sparse array. The reason for such different performances is discussed from the viewpoint of memory access. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.2974;Pair-transfer probability in open- and closed-shell Sn isotopes; M. Grasso,  D. Lacroix,  A. Vitturi;  Approximations made to estimate two-nucleon transfer probabilities in ground-state to ground-state transitions and physical interpretation of these probabilities are discussed. Probabilities are often calculated by approximating both ground states, of the initial nucleus A and of the final nucleus A\pm 2 by the same quasiparticle vacuum. We analyze two improvements of this approach. First, the effect of using two different ground states with average numbers of particles A and A\pm2 is quantified. Second, by using projection techniques, the role of particle number restoration is analyzed. Our analysis shows that the improved treatment plays a role close to magicity, leading to an enhancement of the pair-transfer probability. In mid-shell regions, part of the error made by approximating the initial and final ground states by a single vacuum is compensated by projecting onto good particle number. Surface effects are analyzed by using pairing interactions with a different volume-to-surface mixing. Finally, a simple expression of the pair-transfer probability is given in terms of occupation probabilities in the canonical basis. We show that, in the canonical basis formulation, surface effects which are visible in the transfer probability are related to the fragmentation of single-particle occupancies close to the Fermi energy. This provides a complementary interpretation with respect to the standard quasiparticle representation where surface effects are generated by the integrated radial profiles of the contributing wave functions. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"

Pozzi,  X. Viñas,  M. Warda;  The accurate characterization of the nuclear symmetry energy and its density dependence is one of the outstanding open problems in nuclear physics. A promising nuclear observable in order to constrain the density dependence of the symmetry energy at saturation is the neutron skin thickness of medium and heavy nuclei. Recently, a low-energy peak in the isovector dipole response of neutron-rich nuclei has been discovered that may be correlated with the neutron skin thickness. The existence of this correlation is currently under debate due to our limited experimental knowledge on the microscopic structure of such a peak. We present a detailed analysis of Skyrme Hartree-Fock (HF) plus random phase approximation (RPA) predictions for the dipole response in several neutron-rich nuclei and try to elucidate whether models of common use in nuclear physics confirm or dismiss its possible connection with the neutron skin thickness. Finally, we briefly present theoretical results for parity violating electron scattering on ${}^{208}$Pb at the conditions of the PREx experiment and discuss the implications for the neutron skin thickness of ${}^{208}$Pb and the slope of the symmetry energy. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.3257;Dimensional regularization applied to nuclear matter with a zero--range  interaction; Kassem Moghrabi,  Marcella Grasso;  We apply the dimensional regularization procedure to treat an ultraviolet divergence occurring in the framework of the nuclear many-body problem. We consider the second--order correction (beyond the mean-field approximation) to the equation of state of nuclear matter with a zero-range effective interaction. The unphysical ultraviolet divergence that is generated at second order by the zero range of the interaction is removed by the regularization technique and the regularized equation of state (mean-field + second-order contributions) is adjusted to a reference equation of state. The main practical advantage of this procedure, with respect to a cutoff regularization, is to provide a unique set of parameters for the adjusted effective interaction. This occurs because the regularized second-order correction does not contain any cutoff dependence. The encouraging results found in this work indicate that such an elegant technique to generate regularized effective interactions is likely to be applied in future to finite nuclei in the framework of beyond mean-field models. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

It enables direct evaluation of reaction rate as a function of temperature without solving any scattering problem. The method is tested for two-body radiative capture reaction, ${^{16}{\rm O}}(\alpha,\gamma){^{20}{\rm Ne}}$, showing that it gives identical results to that calculated by the ordinary procedure. The new method will be suited for calculation of triple-alpha radiative capture rate for which an explicit construction of the scattering solution is difficult. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

A liquid droplet model which includes nuclear shell effects is used to provide nuclear masses far from stability. Reaction pathways are determined consistently with the nuclear mass model. The nuclear symmetry energy is an important uncertainty in the masses of the exotic nuclei in the inner crust and varying the symmetry energy changes the amount of deep crustal heating by as much as a factor of two. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)"

The eigenvalues of the operator are verfied to be in good agreement with that of the original Hamiltonian. Furthermore, the pseudospin symmetry is investigated. It is shown that the pseudospin splittings appearing in the nonrelativistic limit are reduced by the contributions from these terms relating the spin-orbit interactions, added by those relating the dynamical terms, and the quality of pseudospin symmetry origins mainly from the competition of the dynamical effects and the spin-orbit interactions. The spin symmetry of antiparticle spectrum is well reproduced in the present calculations. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

The shape and centrality dependence of the transverse momentum spectra of the so-called ""thermal photons"" are well described. The mass and transverse momentum dependence of intermediate mass dileptons also agree with our estimates. The low transverse momenta from which the excessive dileptons (in low to intermediate mass region) arise is suggestive of emissions from a Bose condensate.

Hosaka;  In this manuscript, I will report the details of our recent work on the vector meson-baryon (VB) interaction, which we studied with the motivation of finding dynamical generation of resonances in the corresponding systems. We started our study by building a formalism based on the hidden local symmetry and calculating the leading order contributions to the scattering equations by summing the diagrams with: (a) a vector meson exchange in the t-channel (b) an octet baryon exchange in the s-, u-channels and (c) a contact interaction arising from the part of the vector meson-baryon Lagrangian which is related to the anomalous magnetic moment of the baryons. We find the contribution from all these sources, except the s-channel, to be important. The amplitudes obtained by solving the coupled channel Bethe-Salpeter equations for the systems with total strangeness zero, show generation of one isospin 3/2, spin 1/2 resonance and three isospin 1/2 resonances: two with spin 3/2 and one with spin 1/2. We identify these resonances with $\Delta$ (1900) $S_{31}$, $N^*$(2080) $D_{13}$, $N^*$(1700) $D_{13}$, and $N^*$(2090) $S_{11}$, respectively. We have further extended our study by including pseudoscalar meson-baryon (PB) as the coupled channels of VB systems. For this, we obtain the PB $\rightarrow$ VB amplitudes by using the Kroll-Ruddermann term where, considering the vector meson dominance phenomena, the photon is replaced by a vector meson. The calculations done within this formalism reveal a very strong coupling of the VB channels to the low-lying resonances like $\Lambda$(1405) and $\Lambda$(1670), which can have important implications on certain reactions producing them. In addition to this, we find that the effect of coupling the higher mass states to the lighter channels is not restricted to increasing the width of those states, it can be far more strong. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

The objective is to identify those parameterizations which best satisfy the current understanding of the physics of nuclear matter over a wide range of applications. Out of the 240 models, only 16 are shown to satisfy all these constraints. Additional, more microscopic, constraints on density dependence of the neutron and proton effective mass beta-equilibrium matter, Landau parameters of symmetric and pure neutron nuclear matter, and observational data on high- and low-mass cold neutron stars further reduce this number to 5, a very small group of recommended Skyrme parameterizations to be used in future applications of the Skyrme interaction of nuclear matter related observables. Full information on partial fulfillment of individual constraints by all Skyrme models considered is given. The results are discussed in terms of the physical interpretation of the Skyrme interaction and the validity of its use in mean-field models.

The neutron-proton ($np$) correlation breaks the seniority symmetry in a major way. As a result, the corresponding wave function is a mixture of many components with different seniority quantum numbers. In this contribution we show that the $np$ interaction may favor a new kind of coupling in $N=Z$ nuclei, i.e., the so-called isoscalar spin-aligned $np$ pair mode. Shell model calculations reveal that the ground and low-lying yrast states of the $N = Z$ nuclei $^{92}$Pd and $^{96}$Cd may mainly be built upon such spin-aligned $np$ pairs each carrying the maximum angular momentum $J = 9$ allowed by the shell $0g_{9/2}$ which is dominant in this nuclear region. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

In this contribution we will discuss this neutron-proton pair coupling scheme in detail.

In this method one proceeds by solving the shell model equations in a successive manner. That is, in each step one constructs the building blocks to be used in future steps. We applied this formalism to analyze the unbound nuclei $^{12,13}$Li starting from the one-particle states in $^{10}$Li and two-particle states in $^{11}$Li. In the former case the excitations correspond to the motion of three particles partitioned as the product of a one-particle and two-particle systems. The ground state of $^{12}$Li is thus calculated to be an antibound (virtual) state. In the four-particle system $^{13}$Li the states can be constructed as the coupling of two correlated pairs. We found that there is no bound or antibound state in $^{13}$Li. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

We analyze the properties of the non-diagonal matrix elements with the help of the one-particle and two-particle coefficients of fractional parentage (cfp's). It is found that all non-diagonal (and the relevant diagonal) matrix elements can be re-expressed in simple ways and are proportional to certain one-particle cfp's. This remarkable occurrence of partial dynamic symmetry is the consequence of the peculiar property of the $j=9/2$ shell, where all $v=3$ and 5 states are uniquely defined. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

Id Betan;  The pairing Hamiltonian constitutes an important approximation in many- body systems, it is exactly soluble and quantum integrable. On the other hand, the continuum single particle level density (CSPLD) contains information about the continuum energy spectrum. The question whether one can use the Hamiltonian with constant pairing strength for correlations in the continuum is still unanswered. In this paper we generalize the Richardson exact solution for the pairing Hamiltonian including correlations in the continuum. The resonant and non-resonant continuum are included through the CSPLD. The resonant correlations are made explicit by using the Cauchy theorem. Low lying states with seniority zero and two are calculated for the even Carbon isotopes. We conclude that energy levels can indeed be calculated with constant pairing in the continuum using the CSPLD. It is found that the nucleus $^{24}$C is unbound. The real and complex energy representation of the continuum is developed and their differences are shown. The trajectory of the pair energies in the continuum for the nucleus $^{28}$C is shown. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

This, together with the ultraviolet divergences of two-pion exchanges in the distorted-wave expansion, leads to enhancement of the 1S0 counterterms and results in a pionless-theory-like power counting for the singlet channels. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.4166;Triton photodisintegration in three-dimensional approach; M. A. Shalchi,  S. Bayegan;  Two- and three- particles photodisintegration of the triton is investigated in a three-dimensional (3D) Faddeev approach. For this purpose the Jacobi momentum vectors for three particles system and spin-isospin quantum numbers of the individual nucleons are considered. Based on this picture the three-nucleon Faddeev integral equations with the two-nucleon interaction are formulated without employing the partial wave decomposition. The single nucleon current as well as $\pi-$ and $\rho-$ like exchange currents are used in an appropriate form to be employed in 3D approach. The exchange currents are derived from AV18 NN force. The two-body t-matrix, Deuteron and Triton wave functions are calculated in the 3D approach by using AV18 potential. Benchmarks are presented to compare the total cross section for the two- and three- particles photodisintegration in the range of $E_{\gamma}<30 MeV$. The 3D Faddeev approach shows promising results. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.4272;Precise calculation of the two-step process for K- d -> pi Sigma N in  the Lambda (1405) resonance region; K. Miyagawa,  J. Haidenbauer;  The reaction K- d -> pi Sigma N is investigated taking into account single scattering and the two-step process due to Kbar N -> pi Sigma rescattering. The influence of some common approximations are examined. It is found that the treatment of the kinematics in the Green's function that appears in the loop integral of the rescattering process has a rather strong impact on the resulting lineshape of the pi Sigma invariant mass spectrum. Specifically, a calculation with correct kinematics where the three-body unitarity cut due to the nK- p threshold occurs at the physical value yields a pronounced peak in the invariant mass spectrum at this threshold and, at the same time, suppresses the signal in the region of the Lambda(1405) resonance. On the other hand, an approximation applied in past calculations shifts that threshold down and, consequently, leads to an accidental and therefore erroneous enhancement of the signal of the Lambda(1405) in the pi Sigma invariant mass spectrum. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

Core polarization effects are included through a microscopic theory that includes excitations from the core orbits up to higher orbits with 2$\hbar$$\omega$ excitations. The modified surface delta interaction (MSDI) is employed as a residual interaction.

In this work, we evaluate differential antineutrino-nucleus cross sections with the relativistic Green's function model, where the final-state interactions are described in the inclusive scattering consistently with the exclusive scattering using a complex optical potential.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.4369;Nonmesonic weak decay of Lambda-hypernuclei within independent-particle  shell-model; Franjo Krmpotić,  Alfredo P. Galeão,  Mahir S. Hussein;  After a short introduction to the nonmesonic weak decay (NMWD) $\Lambda N\go nN$ of $\Lambda$-hypernuclei we discuss the long-standing puzzle on the ratio $\Gamma_n/\Gamma_p$, and some recent experimental evidences that signalized towards its final solution. Two versions of the Independent-Particle-Shell-Model (IPSM) are employed to account for the nuclear structure of the final residual nuclei. They are: (a) IPSM-a, where no correlation, except for the Pauli principle, is taken into account, and (b) IPSM-b, where the highly excited hole states are considered to be quasi-stationary and are described by Breit-Wigner distributions, whose widths are estimated from the experimental data. We evaluate the coincidence spectra in $^{4}_\Lambda$He, $^{5}_\Lambda$He, $^{12}_\Lambda$C, $^{16}_\Lambda$O, and $^{28}_\Lambda$Si, as a function of the sum of kinetic energies $E_{nN}=E_n+E_N$ for $N=n,p$. The recent Brookhaven National Laboratory experiment E788 on $^4_\Lambda$He, is interpreted within the IPSM . We found that the shapes of all the spectra are basically tailored by the kinematics of the corresponding phase space, depending very weakly on the dynamics, which is gauged here by the one-meson-exchange-potential. In spite of the straightforwardness of the approach a good agreement with data is achieved. This might be an indication that the final-state-interactions and the two-nucleon induced processes are not very important in the decay of this hypernucleus. We have also found that the $\pi+K$ exchange potential with soft vertex-form-factor cutoffs $(\Lambda_\pi\approx 0.7$ GeV, $\Lambda_K\approx 0.9$ GeV), is able to account simultaneously for the available experimental data related to $\Gamma_p$ and $\Gamma_n$ for $^4_\Lambda$H, $^4_\Lambda$He, and $^5_\Lambda$He. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.4551;Derivation of transient relativistic fluid dynamics from the Boltzmann  equation; G.S. Denicol,  H. Niemi,  E. Molnar,  D.H. Rischke;  In this work we present a general derivation of relativistic fluid dynamics from the Boltzmann equation using the method of moments. The main difference between our approach and the traditional 14-moment approximation is that we will not close the fluid-dynamical equations of motion by truncating the expansion of the distribution function. Instead, we keep all terms in the moment expansion. The reduction of the degrees of freedom is done by identifying the microscopic time scales of the Boltzmann equation and considering only the slowest ones. In addition, the equations of motion for the dissipative quantities are truncated according to a systematic power-counting scheme in Knudsen and inverse Reynolds number. We conclude that the equations of motion can be closed in terms of only 14 dynamical variables, as long as we only keep terms of second order in Knudsen and/or inverse Reynolds number. We show that, even though the equations of motion are closed in terms of these 14 fields, the transport coefficients carry information about all the moments of the distribution function. In this way, we can show that the particle-diffusion and shear-viscosity coefficients agree with the values given by the Chapman-Enskog expansion. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)"

Three phenomenological models are employed in order to check the accuracy of the well known parabolic approximation of the equation of state for asymmetric nuclear matter in the determination of the transition density $n_t$ and transition pressure $P_t$. The results corroborate the statement that the error due to the assumption that a priori the equation of state is parabolic may introduce a large error in the determination of related properties of a neutron star as the crustal fraction of the moment of inertia and the critical frequency of rotating neutron stars. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.4731;Nuclear symmetry energy and the r-mode instability of neutron stars; Isaac Vidana;  We analyze the role of the symmetry energy slope parameter $L$ on the {\it r}-mode instability of neutron stars. Our study is performed using both microscopic and phenomenological approaches of the nuclear equation of state. The microscopic ones include the Brueckner--Hartree--Fock approximation, the well known variational equation of state of Akmal, Pandharipande and Ravenhall, and a parametrization of recent Auxiliary Field Diffusion Monte Carlo calculations. For the phenomenological approaches, we use several Skyrme forces and relativisic mean field models. Our results show that the {\it r}-mode instability region is smaller for those models which give larger values of $L$. The reason is that both bulk ($\xi$) and shear ($\eta$) viscosities increase with $L$ and, therefore, the damping of the mode is more efficient for the models with larger $L$. We show also that the dependence of both viscosities on $L$ can be described at each density by simple power-laws of the type $\xi=A_{\xi}L^{B_\xi}$ and $\eta=A_{\eta}L^{B_\eta}$. Using the measured spin frequency and the estimated core temperature of the pulsar in the low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1608-52, we conclude that observational data seem to favor values of $L$ larger than $\sim 50$ MeV if this object is assumed to be outside the instability region, its radius is in the range $11.5-12$($11.5-13$) km, and its mass $1.4M_\odot$($2M_\odot$). Outside this range it is not possible to draw any conclusion on $L$ from this pulsar. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)"

The model is based on considering the baryon stopping and pair production effects in the processes. Based on some physical reasoning, the dependence is parameterized. Predictions for the net-proton distributions for Au+Au and Pb+Pb collisions at different centralities at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=39 and 2760 GeV, respectively, are presented from the parameterizations for the model parameters. A possible test of our model is proposed from investigating the net proton distributions in the non-central rapidity region for different colliding centralities and energies. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"

The transition from partonic to hadronic degrees of freedom is described by covariant transition rates for the fusion of quark-antiquark pairs or three quarks (antiquarks), respectively, obeying flavor current-conservation, color neutrality as well as energy-momentum conservation. The PHSD approach is applied to nucleus-nucleus collisions from low SIS to RHIC energies. The traces of partonic interactions are found in particular in the elliptic flow of hadrons as well as in their transverse mass spectra. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.5016;Neutron Stars with Hyperons subject to Strong Magnetic Field; L. L. Lopes,  D. P. Menezes;  Neutron stars are one of the most exotic objects in the universe and a unique laboratory to study the nuclear matter above the nuclear saturation density. In this work, we study the equation of state of the nuclear matter within a relativistic model subjected to a strong magnetic field. We then apply this EoS to study and describe some of the physical characteristics of neutron star, especially the mass-radius relation and chemical compositions. To study the influence of a the magnetic field and the hyperons in the stellar interior, we consider altogether four solutions: two different values of magnetic field to obtain a weak and a strong influence, and two configurations: a family of neutron stars formed only by protons, electrons and neutrons and a family formed by protons, electrons, neutrons, muons and hyperons. The limit and the validity of the results found are discussed with some care. In all cases the particles that constitute the neutron star are in $\beta$ equilibrium and zero total net charge. Our work indicates that the effect of a strong magnetic field has to be taken into account in the description of magnetars, mainly if we believe that there are hyperons in their interior, in which case, the influence of the magnetic field can increase the mass by more than 10%. We have also seen that although a magnetar can reach 2.48$M_{\odot}$, a natural explanation of why we do not know pulsars with masses above 2.0$M_{\odot}$ arises. We also discuss how the magnetic field affects the strangeness fraction in some standard neutron star masses and, to conclude our paper, we revisit the direct URCA process related to the cooling of the neutron stars and show how it is affected by the hyperons and the magnetic field. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

These transport parameters have been found to be highly sensitive to the interactions present in hot QCD. Contributions to the transport coefficients from both the gluonic sector and the matter sector have been investigated. The matter sector is found to be significantly dominating over the gluonic sector, in both the cases of $\eta$ and $\zeta$. The temperature dependences of the quantities, $\zeta/{\mathcal S}$, and $\zeta/\eta$ indicate a sharply rising trend for the $\zeta$, closer to the QCD transition temperature. Both $\eta$, and $\zeta$ are shown to be equally significant for the temperatures that are accessible in the relativistic heavy ion collision experiments, and hence play crucial role while investigating the properties of the quark-gluon plasma. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)"

Pastore;  Background: Following the 2007 precise measurements of monopole strengths in tin isotopes, there has been a continuous theoretical effort to obtain a precise description of the experimental results. Up to now, there is no satisfactory explanation of why the tin nuclei appear to be significantly softer than 208Pb. Purpose: We determine the influence of finite-range and separable pairing interactions on monopole strength functions in semi-magic nuclei. Methods: We employ self-consistently the Quasiparticle Random Phase Approximation on top of spherical Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov solutions. We use the Arnoldi method to solve the linear-response problem with pairing. Results: We found that the difference between centroids of Giant Monopole Resonances measured in lead and tin (about 1 MeV) always turns out to be overestimated by about 100%. We also found that the volume incompressibility, obtained by adjusting the liquid-drop expression to microscopic results, is significantly larger than the infinite-matter incompressibility. Conclusions: The zero-range and separable pairing forces cannot induce modifications of monopole strength functions in tin to match experimental data. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

As the mean-field model to investigate nuclear shell structures in a wide range of mass numbers, we propose the radial power-law potential model, V \propto r^\alpha, which enables a simple semiclassical analysis by the use of its scaling property. We find that remarkable shell structures emerge at certain combinations of deformation and diffuseness parameters, and they are closely related to the periodic-orbit bifurcations. In particular, significant roles of the ""bridge orbit bifurcations"" for normal and superdeformed shell structures are pointed out. It is shown that the prolate-oblate asymmetry in deformed shell structures is clearly understood from the contribution of the bridge orbit to the semiclassical level density. The roles of bridge orbit bifurcations in the emergence of superdeformed shell structures are also discussed. ";"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD)"

Meng;  The self-consistent random phase approximation (RPA), based on the framework of relativistic energy density functionals, is employed in the study of isovector and isoscalar dipole response in $^{68}$Ni, $^{132}$Sn, and $^{208}$Pb. The evolution of pygmy dipole states (PDS) in the region of low excitation energies is analyzed as a function of the density-dependence of the symmetry energy for a set of relativistic effective interactions. The occurrence of PDS is predicted in the response to both the isovector and isoscalar dipole operators, and its strength is enhanced with the increase of the symmetry energy at saturation and the slope of the symmetry energy. In both channels the PDS exhausts a relatively small fraction of the energy-weighted sum rule but a much larger percentage of the inverse energy-weighted sum rule. For the isovector dipole operator the reduced transition probability $B(E1)$ of the PDS is generally small because of pronounced cancellation of neutron and proton partial contributions. The isoscalar reduced transition amplitude is predominantly determined by neutron particle-hole configurations, most of which add coherently, and this results in a collective response of the PDS to the isoscalar dipole operator. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

This material is central to many fundamental questions in nuclear physics and astrophysics. Moreover, neutron rich matter is being studied with an extraordinary variety of new tools such as the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) and the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO). We describe the Lead Radius Experiment (PREX) that uses parity violating electron scattering to measure the neutron radius in $^{208}$Pb. This has important implications for neutron stars and their crusts. We discuss X-ray observations of neutron star radii. These also have important implications for neutron rich matter. Gravitational waves (GW) open a new window on neutron rich matter. They come from sources such as neutron star mergers, rotating neutron star mountains, and collective r-mode oscillations. Using large scale molecular dynamics simulations, we find neutron star crust to be very strong. It can support mountains on rotating neutron stars large enough to generate detectable gravitational waves. We believe that combing astronomical observations using photons, GW, and neutrinos, with laboratory experiments on nuclei, heavy ion collisions, and radioactive beams will fundamentally advance our knowledge of compact objects in the heavens, the dense phases of QCD, the origin of the elements, and of neutron rich matter. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1010.0111;Testing the Lambda(1520) hyperon in-medium width in near-threshold  proton-nucleus reactions; E.Ya.Paryev;"  In the framework of the nuclear spectral function approach for incoherent primary proton-nucleon and secondary pion-nucleon production processes we study the inclusive Lambda(1520) hyperon production in the interaction of 2.83 GeV protons with nuclei. In particular, the A and momentum dependences of the absolute and relative Lambda(1520) hyperon yields are investigated in two scenarios for its in-medium width. Our model calculations show that the pion-nucleon production channel contributes distinctly to the ""low-momentum"" Lambda(1520) creation both in light and heavy nuclei in the chosen kinematics and, hence, has to be taken into consideration on close examination of the dependences of the Lambda(1520) hyperon yields on the target mass number with the aim of getting information on its width in the medium. They also demonstrate that both the A dependence of the relative Lambda(1520) hyperon production cross section and momentum dependence of the absolute Lambda(1520) hyperon yield at incident energy of interest are appreciably sensitive to the Lambda(1520) in-medium width, which means that these observables may be an important tool to determine the above width.

Quasi-free kaon production is investigated using the Regge-plus-resonance elementary operator within the relativistic plane-wave impulse approximation. The Regge-plus-resonance model was developed to describe photoinduced and electroinduced charged-kaon production off protons. We show how this elementary operator can be transformed to account for the production of neutral kaons from both protons and neutrons. Our results compare favourably to the sole 2H(gamma,K0)YN dataset published to date. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

Nakamura (Jefferson Laboratory);  We address a question about how much resonance poles and residues extracted from data depend on a model used for the extraction, and on the precision of data. We focus on the P11 pi-N scattering and use the dynamical coupled-channel (DCC) model developed in Excited Baryon Analysis Center (EBAC) at JLab. We examine the model-dependence of the poles by varying parameters largely within the EBAC-DCC model. We find that two poles associated with the Roper resonance are fairly stable against the variation. We also study the stability of the Roper poles against different analytic structure of the P11 amplitude below pi-N threshold by using a bare nucleon model. We again find a good stability of the Roper poles. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"

Mikhailov;  In $pp$ scattering at LHC energies, large numbers of elementary scatterings will contribute significantly, and the corresponding high multiplicity events will be of particular interest. Elementary scatterings are parton ladders, identified with color flux-tubes. In high multiplicity events, many of these flux tubes are produced in the same space region, creating high energy densities. We argue that there are good reasons to employ the successful procedure used for heavy ion collisions: matter is assumed to thermalizes quickly, such that the energy from the flux-tubes can be taken as initial condition for a hydrodynamic expansion. This scenario gets spectacular support from very recent results on Bose-Einstein correlations in $pp$ scattering at 900 GeV at LHC. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1010.0403;D mesons in isospin asymmetric strange hadronic matter; Arvind Kumar,  Amruta Mishra;  We study the in-medium properties of $D$ and $\bar{D}$ mesons in isospin asymmetric hyperonic matter arising due to their interactions with the light hadrons. The interactions of $D$ and $\bar{D}$ mesons with these light hadrons are derived by generalizing the chiral SU(3) model used for the study of hyperonic matter to SU(4). The nucleons, the scalar isoscalar meson, $\sigma$ and the scalar-isovector meson, $\delta$ as modified in the strange hadronic matter, modify the masses of $D$ and $\bar{D}$ mesons. It is found that as compared to the $\bar{D}$ mesons, the $D$ meson properties are more sensitive to the isospin asymmetry at high densities. The effects of strangeness in the medium on the properties of $D$ and $\bar{D}$ mesons are studied in the present investigation. The $D$ mesons ($D^0$,$D^+$) are found to undergo larger medium modifications as compared to $\bar{D}$ mesons ($\bar {D^0}$, $D^-$) with the strangeness fraction, $f_s$ and these modifications are observed to be more appreciable at high densities. The present study of the in-medium properties of $D$ and $\bar{D}$ mesons will be of relevance for the experiments in the future Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research, GSI, where the baryonic matter at high densities will be produced. The isospin asymmetric effects in the doublet $D = (D^{0}, D^{+})$ in the strange hadronic matter should show in observables like their production and flow in asymmetric heavy-ion collisions as well as in $J/\psi$ suppression. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1010.0518;Influence of nuclear de-excitation on observables relevant for space  exploration; Davide Mancusi,  Alain Boudard,  Joseph Cugnon,  Jean-Christophe David,  Sylvie Leray;  The composition of the space radiation environment inside spacecrafts is modified by the interaction with shielding material, with equipment and even with the astronauts' bodies. Accurate quantitative estimates of the effects of nuclear reactions are necessary, for example, for dose estimation and prediction of single-event-upset rates. To this end, it is necessary to construct predictive models for nuclear reactions, which usually consist of an intranuclear-cascade or quantum-molecular-dynamics stage, followed by a nuclear-de-excitation stage. While it is generally acknowledged that it is necessary to accurately simulate the first reaction stage, transport-code users often neglect or underestimate the importance of the choice of the de-excitation code. The purpose of this work is to prove that the de-excitation model is in fact a non-negligible source of uncertainty for the prediction of several observables of crucial importance for space applications. For some particular observables, the systematic uncertainty due to the de-excitation model actually dominates the total uncertainty. Our point will be illustrated by making use of nucleon-nucleus calculations performed with several intranuclear-cascade/de-excitation models, such as the Li\`{e}ge Intranuclear Cascade model (INCL) and Isabel (for the cascade part) and ABLA07, Dresner, GEM, GEMINI++ and SMM (on the de-excitation side). ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM)"

This model has been quite successful in the description of pi-N to pi-N scattering for center-of-mass energies up to 1.9 GeV. The full pion photoproduction amplitude is constructed to satisfy the generalized Ward-Takahashi identity and hence, it is fully gauge invariant. The calculated differential cross sections and photon spin asymmetries up to 1.65 GeV center-of-mass energy for the reactions gamma p to pi+ n, gamma p to pi0 p and gamma n to pi- p are in good agreement with the experimental data. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

This is analytically tractable by assuming a density dependent two-body correlation function of Gaussian type. For the alpha-alpha potential we adopt the phenomenological Ali-Bodmer interaction and semi-microscopic potentials obtained from the Gogny force parametrizations. We show that under such assumptions we achieve a rapid convergence in the cluster expansion, the four-body contributions to the energy being smaller than the two-body and three-body contributions by at least an order of magnitude. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

Margueron,  J. van de Wiele;  Cross sections for ($p,t$) two-neutron transfer reactions are calculated in the one-step zero-range distorted-wave Born approximation for the tin isotopes $^{124}$Sn and $^{136}$Sn and for incident proton energies from 15 to 35 MeV. Microscopic quasiparticle random-phase approximation form factors are provided for the reaction calculation and phenomenological optical potentials are used in both the entrance and the exit channels. Three different surface/volume mixings of a zero-range density-dependent pairing interaction are employed in the microscopic calculations and the sensitivity of the cross sections to the different mixings is analyzed. Since absolute cross sections cannot be obtained within our model, we compare the positions of the diffraction minima and the shapes of the angular distributions. No differences are found in the position of the diffraction minima for the reaction $^{124}$Sn($p,t$)$^{122}$Sn. On the other side, the angular distributions obtained for the reaction $^{136}$Sn($p,t$)$^{134}$Sn with surface and mixed interactions differ at large angles for some values of the incident proton energy. For this reaction, we compare the ratios of the cross sections associated to the ground state and the first excited state transitions. Differences among the three different theoretical predictions are found and they are more important at the incident proton energy of 15 MeV. As a conclusion, we indicate ($p,t$) two-neutron transfer reactions with very neutron-rich Sn isotopes and at proton energies around 15 MeV as good experimental cases where the surface/volume mixing of the pairing interaction may be probed. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

The Chew-Mandelstam technique is discussed and applied to the problem of the S-wave pion- and eta-photoproduction amplitudes. The resulting eta production amplitudes exhibit the expected resonant behavior near the eta production threshold.

The first one is based on the assumption that all gluons (binding and valence gluons) contribute to the nucleon spin, but the second one is based on the assumption that only the binding gluons (and the quarks) contribute to it. We propose the second expression to be the physically correct one. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"

In this work we intend to use the $MSTW 2008$ (Martin et al) parton distribution functions (PDF) and try to calculate $UPDF$ for various values of $x$ (the longitudinal fraction of parton momentum), $\mu$ (the probe scale) and $k_t$ (the parton transverse momentum) to see the general behavior of three dimensional $UPDF$ at the $NLO$ level up to the $LHC$ working energy scales ($\mu^2)$. It is shown that there exits some pronounced peaks for the three dimensional $UPDF$ $(f_a(x,k_t))$ with respect to the two variables $x$ and $k_t$ at various energies ($\mu$). These peaks get larger and move to larger values of $k_t$, as the energy ($\mu$) is increased.

Using 3D-Ising model, the critical behavior of Binder ratios and ratios of high order cumulants of order parameter are fully presented. Binder ratio is shown to be a step function of temperature. The critical point is the intersection of the ratios of different system sizes between two platforms. From low to high temperature through the critical point, the ratios of third order cumulants change their values from negative to positive in a valley shape, and ratios of fourth order cumulants oscillate around zero. The normalized ratios, like the Skewness and Kurtosis, do not diverge with correlation length, in contrary with corresponding cumulants. Applications of these characters in search critical point in relativistic heavy ion collisions are discussed. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex); High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"

Quadrupole and particle multiplicity fluctuations relations are derived in terms of $\frac{T}{\epsilon_f}$. This method is valid for infinite and finite fermionic systems, in particular we apply it to heavy ion collisions using the Constrained Molecular Dynamics (CoMD) approach which includes the Fermi statistics. A preliminary comparison to available experimental data is discussed as well. We stress the differences with methods based on classical approximations. The derived 'quantum' temperatures are systematically lower than the corresponding 'classical' ones.

Sobotka;  Present applications of the dispersive-optical-model analysis are restricted by the use of a local but energy-dependent version of the generalized Hartree-Fock potential. This restriction is lifted by the introduction of a corresponding nonlocal potential without explicit energy dependence. Such a strategy allows for a complete determination of the nucleon propagator below the Fermi energy with access to the expectation value of one-body operators (like the charge density), the one-body density matrix with associated natural orbits, and complete spectral functions for removal strength. The present formulation of the dispersive optical model (DOM) therefore allows the use of elastic electron-scattering data in determining its parameters. Application to ${}^{40}$Ca demonstrates that a fit to the charge radius leads to too much charge near the origin using the conventional assumptions of the functional form of the DOM. A corresponding incomplete description of high-momentum components is identified, suggesting that the DOM formulation must be extended in the future to accommodate such correlations properly. Unlike the local version, the present nonlocal DOM limits the location of the deeply-bound hole states to energies that are consistent with (\textit{e,e}$^{\prime}$\textit{p}) and (\textit{p,2p}) data. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"

The N=Z nuclei 68Se, 72Kr, 76Sr and 80Zr among others are known to give rise to a large-energy x-ray flux and peaks in abundances of these nuclei synthesized in the astrophysical rp-process. Investigating the experimental isotope shifts in Kr isotopes near the proton drip-line within the framework of the deformed Relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory, we have discovered that N=Z rp-process nuclei 68Se, 72Kr, 76Sr and 80Zr exhibit large shell gap both at the proton and neutron numbers in the deformed space with the consequence that pairing correlations for protons and neutrons vanish. This lends a doubly magic character to these nuclei. A significant number of nuclei in this region are also shown to exhibit neutron magicity at N=34, 36, 38, and 40 in the deformed space. A unique case of concomitance of the double magicity and the shape-coexistence is found for 68Se. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"

For this, two main issues are studied: electromagnetic interaction of the virtual photon with the bound nucleon and the strong interactions of the produced baryons in the final state of the reaction. Within virtual nucleon approximation we developed a new prescription to account for the bound nucleon effects in the electromagnetic interaction. The final state interaction at high $Q^2$ kinematics is calculated within generalized eikonal approximation ~ (GEA). Comparison with the first experimental data confirm GEA's early prediction that the rescattering is maximal at $\sim 70^0$ of recoil nucleon production relative to the momentum of the virtual photon. Also the forward recoil nucleon angles are best suited for studies of the deuteron at small distances. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"

The Coulomb force reduces the proton pair energy and the even-odd mass difference by about 25%, except for nuclei at and around the proton shell or subshell closure. We then propose a renormalization scheme via a reduction factor $\gamma_p$ for the proton pairing channel. It is found that a single value of $\gamma_p(=0.90)$ well takes account of the Coulombic effect, for nuclei covering wide range of the mass number and the neutron excess including the nuclei around the shell or subshell closure. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1010.1619;Correlations probed in direct two-nucleon removal reactions; E C Simpson,  J A Tostevin;  Final-state-exclusive momentum distributions of fast, forward travelling residual nuclei, following two nucleon removal from fast secondary radioactive beams of projectile nuclei, can and have now been measured. Assuming that the most important reaction mechanism is the sudden direct removal of a pair of nucleons from a set of relatively simple, active shell-model orbital configurations, such distributions were predicted to depend strongly on the total angular momentum I carried by the two nucleons - the final state spin for spin 0+ projectiles. The sensitivity of these now-accessible observables to specific details of the (correlated) two-nucleon wave functions is of importance. We clarify that it is the total orbital angular momentum L of the two nucleons that is the primary factor in determining the shapes and widths of the calculated momentum distributions. It follows that, with accurate measurements, this dependence upon the L make-up of the two-nucleon wave functions could be used to assess the accuracy of (shell- or many-body) model predictions of these two-nucleon configurations. By use of several tailored examples, with specific combinations of active two-nucleon orbitals, we demonstrate that more subtle structure aspects may be observed, allowing such reactions to probe and/or confirm the details of theoretical model wave functions. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1010.1661;Repulsive nature of optical potentials for high-energy heavy-ion  scattering; T. Furumoto,  Y. Sakuragi,  Y. Yamamoto;  The recent works by the present authors predicted that the real part of heavy-ion optical potentials changes its character from attraction to repulsion around the incident energy per nucleon E/A = 200 - 300 MeV on the basis of the complex G-matrix interaction and the double-folding model (DFM) and revealed that the three-body force plays an important role there. In the present paper, we have precisely analyzed the energy dependence of the calculated DFM potentials and its relation to the elastic-scattering angular distributions in detail in the case of the $^{12}$C + $^{12}$C system in the energy range of E/A = 100 - 400 MeV. The tensor force contributes substantially to the energy dependence of the real part of the DFM potentials and plays an important role to lower the attractive-to-repulsive transition energy. The nearside and farside (N/F) decomposition of the elastic-scattering amplitudes clarifies the close relation between the attractive-to-repulsive transition of the potentials and the characteristic evolution of the calculated angular distributions with the increase of the incident energy. Based on the present analysis, we propose experimental measurements of the predicted strong diffraction phenomena of the elastic-scattering angular distribution caused by the N/F interference around the attractive-to-repulsive transition energy together with the reduced diffractions below and above the transition energy. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"

A strong broadening of the $\rho$ meson, which dominates the spectral function in the low-mass regime, is quantitatively consistent with dilepton excess spectra measured in photoproduction off cold nuclei (CLAS/JLab) and in fixed-target ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions (NA45,NA60/CERN-SPS). The large excess observed by PHENIX at RHIC remains unexplained to date, but is most likely not due to emission from the Quark-Gluon Plasma.

Also we study in details the (K-,p) reaction on C12 with 1 GeV/c momentum kaon beam, based on which a deep kaon nucleus optical potential was claimed in [1]. In our Monte Carlo simulation of this reaction we include not only the quasi-elastic K- p scattering, as in [1], but also K- absorption by one and two nucleons followed by the decay of the hyperon in pi N, which can also produce strength in the region of interest. The final state interactions in terms of multiple scattering of the K-, p and all other primary particles on their way out of the nucleus is also considered. We will show that all these additional mechanisms allow us to explain the observed spectrum with a ""standard"" shallow kaon nucleus optical potential obtained in chiral models. [1] T.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1010.1801;Time-odd mean fields in covariant density functional theory: Rotating  systems; A. V. Afanasjev,  H. Abusara;  Time-odd mean fields (nuclear magnetism) and their impact on physical observables in rotating nuclei are studied in the framework of covariant density functional theory (CDFT). It is shown that they have profound effect on the dynamic and kinematic moments of inertia. Particle number, configuration and rotational frequency dependences of their impact on the moments of inertia have been analysed in a systematic way. Nuclear magnetism can also considerably modify the band crossing features such as crossing frequencies and the properties of the kinematic and dynamic moments of inertia in the band crossing region. The impact of time-odd mean fields on the moments of inertia in the regions away from band crossing only weakly depends on the relativistic mean field parametrization, reflecting good localization of the properties of time-odd mean fields in CDFT. The moments of inertia of normal-deformed nuclei considerably deviate from the rigid body value. On the contrary, superdeformed and hyperdeformed nuclei have the moments of inertia which are close to rigid body value. The structure of the currents in rotating frame, their microscopic origin and the relations to the moments of inertia have been systematically analysed. The phenomenon of signature separation in odd-odd nuclei, induced by time-odd mean fields, has been analysed in detail. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

The analysis of quasiparticle spectra in actinides and the heaviest A ~ 250 nuclei provides a measure of the accuracy of the description of single-particle energies in CDFT and an additional constraint for the choice of effective interactions for the description of superheavy nuclei. The response of these nuclei to the rotation is rather well described by cranked relativistic Hartree+Bogoliubov theory and it serves as a supplementary tool in configuration assignment in odd-mass nuclei. A systematic analysis of the fission barriers with allowance for triaxial deformation shows that covariant density functional theory is able to describe fission barriers on a level of accuracy comparable with the best phenomenological macroscopic+microscopic approaches. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

We identify a tension between the slope of the proton spectra, which (within hydrodynamic simulations that assume a constant shear viscosity to entropy density ratio) prefer larger eta/s values, and the slope of the p_T-dependence of charged hadron elliptic flow, which prefers smaller values of eta/s.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1010.1876;Triangularity and Dipole Asymmetry in Heavy Ion Collisions; Derek Teaney,  Li Yan;  We introduce a cumulant expansion to parameterize possible initial conditions in relativistic heavy ion collisions. We show that the cumulant expansion converges and that it can systematically reproduce the results of Glauber type initial conditions. At third order in the gradient expansion, the cumulants characterize the triangularity $<r^3 \cos3(\phi - \psi_{3,3})>$ and the dipole asymmetry $<r^3 \cos(\phi- \psi_{1,3})>$ of the initial entropy distribution. We show that for mid-peripheral collisions the orientation angle of the dipole asymmetry $\psi_{1,3}$ has a $20%$ preference out of plane. This leads to a small net $v_1$ out of plane. In peripheral and mid-central collisions the orientation angles $\psi_{1,3}$ and $\psi_{3,3}$ are strongly correlated. We study the ideal hydrodynamic response to these cumulants and determine the associated $v_1/\epsilon_1$ and $v_3/\epsilon_3$ for a massless ideal gas equation of state. $v_1$ and $v_3$ develop towards the edge of the nucleus, and consequently the final spectra are more sensitive to the viscous dynamics of freezeout. The hydrodynamic calculations for $v_3$ are compared to Alver and Roland fit of two particle correlation functions. Finally, we propose to measure the $v_1$ associated with the dipole asymmetry and the correlations between $\psi_{1,3}$ and $\psi_{3,3}$ by measuring a two particle correlation with respect to the participant plane, $<\cos(\phi_a - 3\phi_b + 2\Psi_{PP})>$. The hydrodynamic prediction for this correlation function is several times larger than a correlation currently measured by the STAR collaboration, $<\cos(\phi_a + \phi_\b - 2\Psi_{PP})>$. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

These soft modes play an important role for the low-energy dynamics of the system such as the transport phenomena and hence are relevant for late-stage evolution of neutron stars. In the case of the color-spin-locking phase, we use a functional technique to obtain the low-energy effective action for the physical Nambu--Goldstone bosons that survive after gauging the color symmetry. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

Mizusaki;  To discuss whether an enhanced isomer decay is a preferred process in a plasma environment it is required to know the structure of the isomer as well as the nearby states. The spin-21/2, 6.85-hour high-spin isomer in 93Mo is investigated within a shell model which well describes nuclei in this mass region. By using the obtained wave-functions which correctly reproduce the observed B(E2), B(E4), and B(M1) transitions, characteristics of the isomer are shown in comparison with the isomeric states in neighboring nuclei. Calculations suggest that these high-spin isomers are formed with almost pure single-particle-like configurations. The 93Mo 21/2^+ isomer has the predominant configuration $\pi (g_{9/2})^2_{8} \otimes \nu d_{5/2}$ lying below the 15/2^+, 17/2^+, and 19/2^+ states due to neutron-proton interaction, which is the physical origin of its long lifetime. The key E2 transition that connects the 21/2^+ isomer to the upper 17/2^+ level is predicted to be substantial (3.5 W.u), and therefore there is a real prospect for observing induced isomer deexcitation. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"

The effect of different types and size rapidity distributions is studied in elliptical flow. The elliptical flow patterns show important role of the nearby spectator matter on the participant zone. This role is further explained on the basis of passing time of the spectator and expansion time of the participant zone. The transition from the in-plane to out-of-plane is observed only when the mid-rapidity region is included in the rapidity bin, otherwise no transition occurs. The transition energy is found to be highly sensitive towards the size of the rapidity bin, while weakly on the type of the rapidity distribution. The theoretical results are also compared with the experimental findings and are found in good agreement. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1010.2378;Anomalous decays of pseudoscalar mesons; Thimo Petri;  In this thesis we discuss the decays of the pseudoscalar mesons (the neutral pion, the eta and eta-prime) which are governed by the chiral anomaly. Some of these decays are of special interest because their study permits a deep insight into aspects of modern physics. The decays can be classified according to the type of the anomaly (triangle or box) that governs the corresponding amplitude when it is extrapolated to the chiral point. In order to take the momentum dependencies of the form factors into account, the actual calculations are performed in the frame work of vector meson dominance (VMD) models, namely in terms of the original hidden gauge model and modern generalized models. The results of the triangle-anomaly sector show that the hidden gauge model and the modern modifications can describe the data equally well. In the box-anomaly sector the data have a slight preference to the modern modified VMD formulation. The results of the latter also agree very well with the predictions of unitarized chiral perturbation theory. In the case of the box-anomaly decays, we especially analyze the contributions of an unconventional untested CP-violating electric dipole form factor that is sensitive to the strange-quark/antiquark-content of the eta and eta-prime mesons. We verify the claim that it could still be of natural size by comparing with the new KLOE data for eta-> pi+ pi- e+ e-. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1010.2443;Leading twist shadowing, black disk regime and forward hadron production; Mark Strikman;  We review theory of the leading twist nuclear shadowing, and describe phenomenon of post-selection suppression of leading parton spectrum (effective fractional energy losses) in the proximity of the black disk regime. We argue that $2 \to 2$ mechanism dominates in the inclusive leading pion production in d-Au collisions and explain that the post-selection naturally explains both the magnitude of the suppression of the forward pion production in d-Au collisions and the pattern of the forward - central correlations. At the same time this pattern of correlations rules out $2\to 1$ mechanism as the main source of the inclusive leading pion yield. It is demonstrated that the mechanism of the double parton interactions gives an important contribution to the production of two leading pions in $pp$ scattering opening a new way to study correlations of leading quarks in the nucleon. The same mechanism is enhanced in $dAu \to \pi^0\pi^0 +X$ collisions and explains the dominance of $\Delta\phi$ independent component and suppression of the away side peak. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

This allows to access the proton electromagnetic form factors in the time-like region of q^2 near the (pbar p) threshold.

We will focus on the interplay between reaction mechanisms, fusion vs. break-up (fast-fission, deep-inelastic), that in exotic systems is expected to be influenced by the symmetry energy term at densities around the normal value. The evolution of the system is described by a Stochastic Mean Field transport equation (SMF), where two parametrizations for the density dependence of symmetry energy (Asysoft and Asystiff) are implemented, allowing one to explore the sensitivity of the results to this ingredient of the nuclear interaction. The method described here, based on the event by event evolution of phase space quadrupole collective modes will nicely allow to extract the fusion probability at relatively early times, when the transport results are reliable. Fusion probabilities for reactions induced by 132Sn on 64,58Ni targets at 10 AMeV are evaluated. We obtain larger fusion cross sections for the more n-rich composite system, and, for a given reaction, in the Asysoft choice. Finally a collective charge equilibration mechanism (the Dynamical Dipole) is revealed in both fusion and break-up events, depending on the stiffness of the symmetry term just below saturation. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"

This development allows for consistent treatment of isospin mixing in both ground and exited nuclear states. In this study, we apply this method to evaluate the isospin impurities in ground states of even-even and odd-odd N~Z nuclei.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1010.3246;Parity Violating Electron Scattering Measurements of Neutron Densities; Shufang Ban,  C. J. Horowitz,  R. Michaels;  Parity violating electron scattering allows model independent measurements of neutron densities that are free from most strong interaction uncertainties. In this paper we present statistical error estimates for a variety of experiments. The neutron radius $R_n$ can be measured in several nuclei, as long as the nuclear excited states are not too low in energy. We present error estimates for $R_n$ measurements in $^{40}$Ca, $^{48}$Ca, $^{112}$Sn, $^{120}$Sn, $^{124}$Sn, and $^{208}$Pb. In general, we find that the smaller the nucleus, the easier the measurement. This is because smaller nuclei can be measured at higher momentum transfers where the parity violating asymmetry $A_{pv}$ is larger. Also in general, the more neutron rich the isotope, the easier the measurement, because neutron rich isotopes have larger weak charges and larger $A_{pv}$. Measuring $R_n$ in $^{48}$Ca appears very promising because it has a higher figure of merit than $^{208}$Pb. In addition, $R_n(^{48}$Ca) may be more easily related to two nucleon and three nucleon interactions, including very interesting three neutron forces, than $R_n(^{208}$Pb). After measuring $R_n$, one can constrain the surface thickness of the neutron density $a_n$ with a second measurement at somewhat higher momentum transfers. We present statistical error estimates for measuring $a_n$ in $^{48}$Ca, $^{120}$Sn, and $^{208}$Pb. Again, we find that $a_n$ is easier to measure in smaller nuclei. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1010.3321;Barrier modification in sub-barrier fusion reactions using Wong formula  with Skyrme forces in semiclassical formalism; Raj Kumar,  Raj K. Gupta;"  We obtain the nuclear proximity potential by using semiclassical extended Thomas Fermi (ETF) approach in Skyrme energy density formalism (SEDF), and use it in the extended $\ell$-summed Wong formula under frozen density approximation. This method has the advantage of allowing the use of different Skyrme forces, giving different barriers. Thus, for a given reaction, we could choose a Skyrme force with proper barrier characteristics, not-requiring extra ``barrier lowering"" or ``barrier narrowing"" for a best fit to data. For the $^{64}$Ni+$^{100}$Mo reaction, the $\ell$-summed Wong formula, with effects of deformations and orientations of nuclei included, fits the fusion-evaporation cross section data exactly for the force GSkI, requiring additional barrier modifications for forces SIII and SV. However, the same for other similar reactions, like $^{58,64}$Ni+$^{58,64}$Ni, fits the data best for SIII force. Hence, the barrier modification effects in $\ell$-summed Wong expression depends on the choice of Skyrme force in extended ETF method. ";Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

We find that a very much improved fit (almost exact, point to point) to the data is obtained for the frozen-density approximation with {\ell}max (Ec.m.) varying smoothly. On the other hand, the same could not be achieved in the sudden case, still requiring a modification of the barrier at both the below- and above-barrier energies. This result means to say that the phenomenon of hindrance, observed in coupled channel calculations for 64Ni+64Ni reaction, could be explained simply on the basis of the {\ell}-summed Wong expression, at least for the frozen-density approximation in ETF method of SEDF. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

Uncertainties arising from experimental uncertainties on the form factors and lack of measured data at high $Q^2$ are treated. A key feature of the FRA is that a form factor measured at a given value of $Q^2$ is related to a definite region in coordinate space. An exact relation between the FRA and the use of a Bessel series is derived. The proton Dirac form factor is well enough known such that the transverse charge density is very accurately known except for transverse separations $b$ less than about 0.1 fm. The Pauli form factor is well known to $Q^2$ of about 10 GeV$^2$, and this allows a reasonable, but improvable, determination of the anomalous magnetic moment density. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1010.3641;On a Missed Mechanism of Dielectron Production in Nucleon-Nucleon  Collisions; Anatoliy S. Khrykin;  We examine a new mechanism of $e^+e^-$ pair production in $NN$ collisions associated with the $NN$-decoupled dibaryon $d^\star_1$(1956) formation in the process $NN \to \gamma^\star d^\star_1$, where $\gamma^\star$ is the virtual photon which converts into a $e^+e^-$ pair. It is shown that a substantial excess of dielectron yields from $Ca+Ca$ and $C+C$ collisions at 1 GeV/A in the dielectron mass spectra in the region from 0.2 to 0.5 GeV/$c^2$ measured by the \textit{DLS Collaboration} as compared with calculated ones can be attributed to the contribution of this mechanism. A simple means for verification of the existence of such a mechanism is proposed. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"

Providência;  In the present paper, the pasta phase is studied at finite temperatures within a Thomas-Fermi (TF) approach. Relativistic mean field models, both with constant and density-dependent couplings, are used to describe this frustrated system. We compare the present results with previous ones obtained within a phase-coexistence description and conclude that the TF approximation gives rise to a richer inner pasta phase structure and the homogeneous matter appears at higher densities. Finally, the transition density calculated within TF is compared with the results for this quantity obtained with other methods. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

On the other hand we also report on a new, hidden strangeness $N^*$ state, mostly made of $K \bar{K} N$, with mass around 1920 MeV, which we think could be responsible for the peak seen in the $\gamma p \to K^+ \Lambda$ around this energy. Finally we address a very novel topic in which we show how few body systems of several $\rho$ mesons can be produced, with their spins aligned up to J=6, and how these states found theoretically can be associated to several known mesons with spins J=2,3,4,5,6. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

Bertulani;  The nucleus-nucleus interaction potential has been studied within the relativistic mean field theory. The systematics of the relativistic effects have been investigated by analyzing the relation between the potential and the bombarding energy as a function of the impact parameter. It is shown that the potential barriers are noticeably sensitive to the bombarding energy for a given impact parameter. At large bombarding energies the slope at the potential edge decreases with the impact parameter. Comparisons with a non-relativistic treatment shows that relativistic effects cannot be ignored at bombarding energies around and larger than 100 MeV/nucleon. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1010.3919;Resonances and Decay Widths within a Relativistic Coupled Channel  Approach; Regina Kleinhappel,  Wolfgang Schweiger;  We present a microscopic model for hadron resonances which contains, in addition to constituent (anti)quarks, mesonic degrees of freedom. It is assumed that the (anti)quarks are confined by an instantaneous potential and that the mesons can couple directly to the (anti)quarks. This system is treated within a relativistic coupled-channel formalism in order to take the dynamics of the mesonic degrees of freedom fully into account. It is demonstrated that the mass eigenvalue problem for such a system can be reformulated as a purely hadronic eigenvalue problem in which bare hadrons, i.e. eigenstates of the pure confinement problem, are coupled via meson loops. The substructure of the bare hadrons is then hidden in (bare) hadron-meson vertex form factors. It is shown for a simple toy model that such a kind of approach may lead to reasonable (non-perturbative) decay widths for hadron resonances. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)"

We aim at exact solutions to such scattering problems. Along this path we demonstrate solution to model Hamiltonians, and develop different techniques for addressing these complex reaction-physics problems, discuss their applicability, and investigate the relevant convergence issues. As examples, we study the scattering of a two-constituent deuteron-like systems either with an infinite set of intrinsic bound states or with a continuum of states that allows for breakup. We show that the internal degrees of freedom of the projectile and its virtual excitation in the course of reactions play an important role in shaping the S-matrix and related observables, giving rise to enhanced or reduced tunneling in various situations. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1010.4103;$ ω(\to π^+π^-π^0) $ meson photoproduction on proton; Swapan Das;  The cross section is estimated for the $\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$ invariant mass distribution in the $\gamma p$ reaction in the GeV region. This reaction is assumed to proceed through the formation of the $\omega$ meson in the intermediate state, since the production cross section for this meson in the $\gamma p$ reaction in GeV region is significant and it has large branching ratio (88.8%) in the $\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$ channel. The cross sections for this reaction have been calculated using the energy dependent reaction amplitude, i.e., $f_{\gamma p \to \omega p}(0)$, extracted from the latest $\omega$ meson photoproduction data. We use established procedure to calculate other factors, like width and propagator of the $\omega$ meson, so that our calculation can provide reliable cross section. The calculated results reproduce the measured $\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$ invariant mass distribution spectra in the $\gamma p$ reaction. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

This is derived from the CD-Bonn nucleon-nucleon potential renormalized by way of the V-low-k approach, considering 48Ca as an inert core and including the neutron 0g9/2 orbital. We compare our results with experiment and with the results of a previous study where 40Ca was assumed as a closed core and the standard 1p0f model space was employed. The calculated spectroscopic properties are in both cases in very good agreement with the available experimental data and enable a discussion on the role of the g9/2 single-particle state in the heavy-mass Ca isotopes. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

At present, the most exotic Sn isotope for which some experimental information exists is 134Sn with an N/Z ratio of 1.68. It is the aim of our study to compare the results of our calculations with the available experimental data and to make predictions for the neighboring heavier isotopes which may be within reach of the next generation of radioactive ion beam facilities. The very good agreement between theory and experiment obtained for 134Sn gives confidence in the predictive power of our realistic shell-model calculations. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

The polarization observables are described by various beam, target and beam-target asymmetries for polarized photons and/or polarized nucleons. They are given as bilinear hermitean forms in the reaction matrix elements divided by the unpolarized cross section. Numerical results for the linear and circular beam asymmetries for $\gamma p\to\pi^0\eta p$ are obtained within an isobar model and are compared with existing data. Predictions are also given for the target asymmetry $T_{11}$, and the beam-target asymmetries $T^c_{10}$ and $T^c_{11}$ for circularly polarized photons. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

In addition to the normal and plasmino modes, the spectral function also exhibits an essentially nonperturbative zero mode for temperatures extending to 1.4-1.8-times the critical temperature, T_c. In the neighbourhood of T_c, this long-wavelength mode contains the bulk of the spectral strength and so long as this mode persists, the system may fairly be described as a strongly-coupled state of matter. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"

It is intended to present the basic definitions essential for studies in nuclear astrophysics, to point out the differences between nuclear reactions taking place in stars and in a terrestrial laboratory, and to illustrate some of the challenges to be faced in theoretical and experimental studies of those reactions. The discussion revolves around the relevant quantities for astrophysics, which are the astrophysical reaction rates.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1010.4359;Bulk Viscosity and Relaxation Time of Causal Dissipative Relativistic  Fluid Dynamics; Xu-Guang Huang,  Takeshi Kodama,  Tomoi Koide,  Dirk H. Rischke;  The microscopic formulae of the bulk viscosity $\zeta $ and the corresponding relaxation time $\tau_{\Pi}$ in causal dissipative relativistic fluid dynamics are derived by using the projection operator method. In applying these formulae to the pionic fluid, we find that the renormalizable energy-momentum tensor should be employed to obtain consistent results. In the leading order approximation in the chiral perturbation theory, the relaxation time is enhanced near the QCD phase transition and $\tau_{\Pi}$ and $\zeta $ are related as $\tau_{\Pi}=\zeta /[\beta \{(1/3-c_{s}^{2})(\epsilon +P)-2(\epsilon -3P)/9\}]$, where $\epsilon $, $P$ and $c_{s}$ are the energy density, pressure and velocity of sound, respectively. The predicted $\zeta $ and $% \tau_{\Pi}$ should satisfy the so-called causality condition. We compare our result with the results of the kinetic calculation by Israel and Stewart and the string theory, and confirm that all the three approaches are consistent with the causality condition. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1010.4555;Determining pseudoscalar meson photo-production amplitudes from complete  experiments; A. M. Sandorfi,  S. Hoblit,  H. Kamano,  T.-S. H. Lee;  We review the development of the most general analytic form of the cross section, dependent upon the three polarization vectors of the beam, target and recoil baryon, including all single, double and triple-polarization terms involving 16 spin-dependent observables. We examine the different conventions that have been used by different authors, and we present expressions that allow the direct numerical calculation of any pseudoscalar meson photo-production observables with arbitrary spin projections from the Chew-Goldberger-Low-Nambu amplitudes. We use this numerical tool to clarify apparent sign differences that exist in the literature. We also present analytic expressions that determine the recoil baryon polarization, together with examples of their potential use with quasi-4pi detectors to deduce observables. As an illustration of the use of the consistent machinery presented in this review, we carry out a multipole analysis of the gamma p -> K^+ Lambda reaction and examine the impact of recently published polarization measurements. In fitting multipoles, we use a combined Monte Carlo sampling of the amplitude space, with gradient minimization, and find a shallow chi^2 valley pitted with a very large number of local minima. This results in broad bands of multipole solutions that are experimentally indistinguishable. While these bands have been noticeably narrowed by the inclusion of new polarization measurements, many of the multipoles remain very poorly determined, even in sign, despite the inclusion of data on 8 different observables. We have compared multipoles from recent PWA codes with our model-independent solution bands. The potential accuracy of amplitudes that could be extracted from measurements of all 16 polarization observables has been studied with mock data using the statistical variations that are expected from ongoing experiments. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"

This problem contains some of the dynamical features present in the collision of atomic, molecular and nuclear systems. The scattering problem is solved exactly, for the case of a harmonic interaction between the fragments. The exact result is used to assess the validity of two different approximations to the scattering process. The adiabatic approximation, which considers that the relative co-ordinate is frozen during the scattering process, is found to be inadequate for this problem. The uncorrelated scattering approximation, which neglects the correlation between the fragments, gives results in accordance with the exact calculations when the scattering energy is high compared to the oscillator parameter. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Atomic and Molecular Clusters (physics.atm-clus); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

Rodriguez-Guzman,  L.M. Robledo,  P. Sarriguren;  Spectroscopic calculations are carried out, for the description of the shape/phase transition in Pt nuclei in terms of the Interacting Boson Model (IBM) Hamiltonian derived from (constrained) Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) calculations with the finite range and density dependent Gogny-D1S Energy Density Functional. Assuming that the many-nucleon driven dynamics of nuclear surface deformation can be simulated by effective bosonic degrees of freedom, the Gogny-D1S potential energy surface (PES) with quadrupole degrees of freedom is mapped onto the corresponding PES of the IBM. Using this mapping procedure, the parameters of the IBM Hamiltonian, relevant to the low-lying quadrupole collective states, are derived as functions of the number of valence nucleons. Merits of both Gogny-HFB and IBM approaches are utilized so that the spectra and the wave functions in the laboratory system are calculated precisely. The experimental low-lying spectra of both ground-state and side-band levels are well reproduced. From the systematics of the calculated spectra and the reduced E2 transition probabilities $B$(E2), the prolate-to-oblate shape/phase transition is shown to take place quite smoothly as a function of neutron number $N$ in the considered Pt isotopic chain, for which the $\gamma$-softness plays an essential role. All these spectroscopic observables behave consistently with the relevant PESs and the derived parameters of the IBM Hamiltonian as functions of $N$. Spectroscopic predictions are also made for those nuclei which do not have enough experimental E2 data. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1010.5396;Origin of the neutron skin thickness of 208Pb in nuclear mean-field  models; M. Centelles,  X. Roca-Maza,  X. Viñas,  M. Warda;  We study whether the neutron skin thickness (NST) of 208Pb originates from the bulk or from the surface of the nucleon density distributions, according to the mean-field models of nuclear structure, and find that it depends on the stiffness of the nuclear symmetry energy. The bulk contribution to NST arises from an extended sharp radius of neutrons, whereas the surface contribution arises from different widths of the neutron and proton surfaces. Nuclear models where the symmetry energy is stiff, as typical relativistic models, predict a bulk contribution in NST of 208Pb about twice as large as the surface contribution. In contrast, models with a soft symmetry energy like common nonrelativistic models predict that NST of 208Pb is divided similarly into bulk and surface parts. Indeed, if the symmetry energy is supersoft, the surface contribution becomes dominant. We note that the linear correlation of NST of 208Pb with the density derivative of the nuclear symmetry energy arises from the bulk part of NST. We also note that most models predict a mixed-type (between halo and skin) neutron distribution for 208Pb. Although the halo-type limit is actually found in the models with a supersoft symmetry energy, the skin-type limit is not supported by any mean-field model. Finally, we compute parity-violating electron scattering in the conditions of the 208Pb parity radius experiment (PREX) and obtain a pocket formula for the parity-violating asymmetry in terms of the parameters that characterize the shape of the 208Pb nucleon densities. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"

The potential energy surface is analyzed for carbon hypernuclei as well as for sd-shell hypernuclei such as $^{27,29}_{\Lambda}$Si and $^{25,27}_{\Lambda}$Mg. We show that the potential energy surface in the ($\beta,\gamma$) plane is similar to each other between the hypernuclei and the corresponding core nuclei, although the addition of $\Lambda$ hyperon makes the energy surface somewhat softer along the $\gamma$ direction. Our calculation implies that the energy of the $\gamma$ vibration for $^{25,27}_{\Lambda}$Mg nuclei is lowered by about 0.15 MeV with respect to that of $^{24,26}$Mg nuclei. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

Ramos;  We study the \eta' N interaction within a chiral unitary approach which includes \pi N, \eta N and related pseudoscalar meson-baryon coupled channels. Since the SU(3) singlet does not contribute to the standard interaction and the \eta' is mostly a singlet, the resulting scattering amplitude is very small and inconsistent with experimental estimations of the \eta' N scattering length. The additional consideration of vector meson-baryon states into the coupled channel scheme, via normal and anomalous couplings of pseudoscalar to vector mesons, enhances substantially the \eta' N amplitude. We also exploit the freedom of adding to the Lagrangian a new term, allowed by the symmetries of QCD, which couples baryons to the singlet meson of SU(3). Adjusting the unknown strength to the \eta' N scattering length, we obtain predictions for the elastic \eta' N --> \eta' N and inelastic \eta' N --> \eta N, \pi N, K\Lambda, K\Sigma\ cross sections at low \eta' energies, and discuss their significance. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1010.5856;Role of isospin physics in supernova matter and neutron stars; Bharat K. Sharma,  Subrata Pal;  We investigate the liquid-gas phase transition of hot protoneutron stars shortly after their birth following supernova explosion and the composition and structure of hyperon-rich (proto)neutron stars within a relativistic mean-field model where the nuclear symmetry energy has been constrained from the measured neutron skin thickness of finite nuclei. Light clusters are abundantly formed with increasing temperature well inside the neutrino-sphere for an uniform supernova matter. Liquid-gas phase transition is found to suppress the cluster yield within the coexistence phase as well as decrease considerably the neutron-proton asymmetry over a wide density range. We find symmetry energy has a modest effect on the boundaries and the critical temperature for the liquid-gas phase transition, and the composition depends more sensitively on the number of trapped neutrinos and temperature of the protoneutron star. The influence of hyperons in the dense interior of stars makes the overall equation of state soft. However, neutrino trapping distinctly delays the appearance of hyperons due to abundance of electrons. We also find that a softer symmetry energy further makes the onset of hyperon less favorable. The resulting structures of the (proto)neutron stars with hyperons and with liquid-gas phase transition are discussed. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

It is based in taking the $\hbar \to 0$, i.e. Thomas-Fermi, limit of the gap equation written in the basis of the mean field (weak coupling). In addition to the position dependence of the Fermi momentum, the size dependence of the matrix elements of the pairing force is also taken into account in this theory. An example typical for the nuclear situation shows the improvement of this new approach over the standard Local Density Approximation. We also show that if in this approach some shell fluctuations are introduced in the level density, the arch structure displayed by the quantal gaps along isotopic chains is almost recovered. We also point out that in heavy drip line nuclei pairing is strongly reduced. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

Oset;  We perform a calculation for the three body $N \bar{K} K$ scattering amplitude by using the fixed center approximation to the Faddeev equations, taking the interaction between $N$ and $\bar{K}$, $N$ and $K$, and $\bar{K}$ and $K$ from the chiral unitary approach. The resonant structures show up in the modulus squared of the three body scattering amplitude and suggest that a $N\bar{K}K$ hadron state can be formed. Our results are in agreement with others obtained in previous theoretical works, which claim a new $N^*$ resonance around 1920 MeV with spin-parity $J^P=1/2^+$. The existence of these previous works allows us to test the accuracy of the fixed center approximation in the present problem and sets the grounds for possible application in similar problems, as an explorative tool to determine bound or quasibound three hadron systems. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1205.0277;Three particles in a finite volume: The breakdown of spherical symmetry; Simon Kreuzer,  Harald W. Grießhammer;  Lattice simulations of light nuclei necessarily take place in finite volumes, thus affecting their infrared properties. These effects can be addressed in a model-independent manner using Effective Field Theories. We study the model case of three identical bosons (mass m) with resonant two-body interactions in a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions, which can also be generalized to the three-nucleon system in a straightforward manner. Our results allow for the removal of finite volume effects from lattice results as well as the determination of infinite volume scattering parameters from the volume dependence of the spectrum. We study the volume dependence of several states below the break-up threshold, spanning one order of magnitude in the binding energy in the infinite volume, for box side lengths L between the two-body scattering length a and L = 0.25a. For example, a state with a three-body energy of -3/(ma^2) in the infinite volume has been shifted to -10/(ma^2) at L = a. Special emphasis is put on the consequences of the breakdown of spherical symmetry and several ways to perturbatively treat the ensuing partial wave admixtures. We find their contributions to be on the sub-percent level compared to the strong volume dependence of the S-wave component. For shallow bound states, we find a transition to boson-diboson scattering behavior when decreasing the size of the finite volume. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat)"

Questions arising from diagrammatics, intermediate-states and order-by-order convergences, and their dependence on the chosen nucleon-nucleon potential, are discussed in detail, and the results of numerical applications for the p-shell model space starting from chiral next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order potentials are shown. Moreover, an alternative graphical method to derive the effective hamiltonian, based on the Z-box vertex function recently introduced by Suzuki et al., is applied to the case of a non-degenerate (0+2) hbaromega model space. Finally, our shell-model results are compared with the exact ones obtained from no-core shell-model calculations. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1205.0431;Pressure Corrections to the Equation of State in the Nuclear Mean Field; Jacek Rozynek;"  We show the connection between stiffness of equation of state in a Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) of Nuclear Matter (NM) and the existence of a strong violation of longitudinal Momentum Sum Rule (MSR) in RMF for a finite pressure. The increasing pressure between nucleons starts to increase the ratio of nucleon Fermi to average single particle energy and according to the Hugenholtz-van Hove theorem valid for NM the MSR is broken. In order to satisfy that MSR we propose changes which modify the nucleon Parton Distribution Function (PDF) above a saturation density. The course of Equation o State in our modified RMF model is very close to semi-empirical estimation and to results obtained from extensive DBHF calculations with a Bonn A potential. Other features of the model includes a good values saturation properties including spin-orbit term. Specially the proper stiffness of EoS recently discussed in an application to compact and neutron stars is important when studying star properties (mass-radius constraint), especially the mass of ""PSR J1614-2230"" the most massive known neutron star, which rules out many soft equations of state including exotic matter. An admixture of additional hyperons are discussed in our approach. ";Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

Mackintosh;  In what follows we first set the context for inverse scattering in nuclear physics with a brief account of inverse problems in general. We then turn to inverse scattering which involves the S-matrix, which connects the interaction potential between two scattering particles with the measured scattering cross section. The term `inverse' is a reference to the fact that instead of determining the scattering S-matrix from the interaction potential between the scattering particles, we do the inverse. That is to say, we calculate the interaction potential from the S-matrix. This review explains how this can now be done reliably, but the emphasis will be upon reasons why one should wish to do this, with an account of some of the ways this can lead to understanding concerning nuclear interactions. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"

The key issue is the proper treatment of the continuum, that is allowed by the coordinate space representation. Our formalism, based on the use of zero-range interactions like the Skyrme forces, is microscopic and fully self-consistent. We apply it to the case of neutron single-particle states in $^{40}$Ca, $^{208}$Pb and $^{24}$O. The first two cases are meant to illustrate the comparison with the usual (i.e., discrete) PVC model. However, we stress that the present approach allows to calculate properly the effect of PVC on resonant states. We compare our results with those from experiments in which the particle transfer in the continuum region has been attempted. The latter case, namely $^{24}$O, is chosen as an example of a weakly-bound system. Such a nucleus, being double-magic and not displaying collective low-lying vibrational excitations, is characterized by quite pure neutron single-particle states around the Fermi surface. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1205.0857;Generic Constraints on the Relativistic Mean-Field and  Skyrme-Hartree-Fock Models from the Pure Neutron Matter Equation of State; F. J. Fattoyev,  W. G. Newton,  Jun Xu,  Bao-An Li;  We study the nuclear symmetry energy S(rho) and related quantities of nuclear physics and nuclear astrophysics predicted generically by relativistic mean-field (RMF) and Skyrme-Hartree-Fock (SHF) models. We establish a simple prescription for preparing equivalent RMF and SHF parametrizations starting from a minimal set of empirical constraints on symmetric nuclear matter, nuclear binding energy and charge radii, enforcing equivalence of their Lorenz effective masses, and then using the pure neutron matter (PNM) equation of state (EoS) obtained from ab-initio calculations to optimize the pure isovector parameters in the RMF and SHF models. We find the resulting RMF and SHF parametrizations give broadly consistent predictions of the symmetry energy J and its slope parameter L at saturation density within a tight range of <~2 MeV and <~6 MeV respectively, but that clear model dependence shows up in the predictions of higher-order symmetry energy parameters, leading to important differences in (a) the slope of the correlation between J and L from the confidence ellipse, (b) the isospin-dependent part of the incompressibility of nuclear matter K_tau, (c) the symmetry energy at supra-saturation densities, and (d) the predicted neutron star radii. The model dependence can lead to about 1-2 km difference in predictions of the neutron star radius given identical predicted values of J, L and symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) saturation properties. Allowing the full freedom in the effective masses in both models leads to constraints of 30<~J<~31.5 MeV, 35<~L<~60 MeV, -330<~K_tau<~-216 MeV for the RMF model as a whole and 30<~J<~33 MeV, 28<~L<~65 MeV, -420<~K_tau<~-325 MeV for the SHF model as a whole. Notably, given PNM constraints, these results place RMF and SHF models as a whole at odds with some constraints on K_tau inferred from giant monopole resonance and neutron skin experimental results. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1205.0867;Covariant density functional theory for antimagnetic rotation; P. W. Zhao,  J. Peng,  H. Z. Liang,  P. Ring,  J. Meng;"  Following the previous letter on the first microscopic description of the antimagnetic rotation (AMR) in 105Cd, a systematic investigation and detailed analysis for the AMR band in the frame-work of tilted axis cranking (TAC) model based on covariant density functional theory are carried out. After performing the microscopic and self-consistentTAC calculations with an given density functional, the configuration for the observed AMR band in 105Cd is obtained from the single-particle Routhians. With the configuration thus obtained, the tilt angle for a given rotational frequency is determined self-consistently by minimizing the total Routhian with respect to the tilt angle. In such a way, the energy spectrum, total angular momenta, kinetic and dynamic moments of inertia, and the B(E2) values for the AMR band in 105Cd are calculated. Good agreement with the data is found. By investigating microscopically the contributions from neutrons and protons to the total angular momentum, the ""two-shears-like"" mechanism in the AMR band is clearly illus-trated. Finally, the currents leading to time-odd mean fields in the Dirac equation are presented and discussed in detail. It is found that they are essentially determined by the valence particles and/or holes. Their spatial distribution and size depend onthe specific single-particle orbitals and the rotational frequency. ";"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1205.0983;Phase transitions in dense matter and the maximum mass of neutron stars; N. Chamel,  A. F. Fantina,  J. M. Pearson,  S. Goriely;"  The recent precise measurement of the mass of pulsar PSR J1614$-$2230, as well as observational indications of even more massive neutron stars, has revived the question of the composition of matter at the high densities prevailing inside neutron-star cores. We study the impact on the maximum possible neutron-star mass of an ""exotic"" core consisting of non-nucleonic matter. For this purpose, we study the occurrence of a first-order phase transition in nucleonic matter. Given the current lack of knowledge of non-nucleonic matter, we consider the stiffest possible equation of state subject only to the constraints of causality and thermodynamic stability. The case of a hadron-quark phase transition is discussed separately. The purely nucleonic matter is described using a set of unified equations of state that have been recently developed to permit a consistent treatment of both homogeneous and inhomogeneous phases. We then compute the mass-radius relation of cold nonaccreting neutron stars with and without exotic cores from the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations. We find that even if there is a significant softening of the equation of state associated with the actual transition to an exotic phase, there can still be a stiffening at higher densities closer to the center of the star that is sufficient to increase the maximum possible mass. However with quarks the maximum neutron-star mass is always reduced by assuming that the sound speed is limited by $c/\sqrt{3}$ as suggested by QCD calculations. In particular, by invoking such a phase transition, it becomes possible to support PSR J1614$-$2230 with a nucleonic equation of state that is soft enough to be compatible with the kaon and pion production in heavy-ion collisions.

Mosel;  Background: Nuclear effects can have a significant impact on neutrino-nucleus interactions. In particular, data from neutrino experiments with broad energy distributions require complex theoretical models that are able to take all the relevant channels into account as well as incorporate nuclear effects in both initial and final-state interactions. Purpose: We investigate neutrino and antineutrino scattering on iron and carbon in the energy range from 1 to 30 GeV, which is relevant to current and coming experiments (MINOS, NOvA, and Minerva). Method: The Giessen Boltzmann--Uehling--Uhlenbeck (GiBUU) model, which implements all reaction channels relevant for neutrino energies under consideration, is used for an investigation of neutrino-nucleus reactions. Results: Our calculations are compared with the recent NOMAD and MINOS data for the integrated inclusive cross sections. Predictions are made for the differential cross sections for semiinclusive final states (pions, kaons, and nucleons) for the MINOS and NOvA beams. Conclusions: Nuclear effects in the initial-state interactions may slightly change the inclusive nuclear cross section as compared to the free nucleon ones. Final-state interactions noticeably change the spectra of the outgoing hadrons. In the Minerva and NOvA experiments these effects should be visible in the kinetic energy distributions of the final pions, kaons, and nucleons. Secondary interactions play an important role for strangeness production. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1205.1582;Relativistic effect of spin and pseudospin symmetries; Shou-Wan Chen,  Jian-You Guo;  Dirac Hamiltonian is scaled in the atomic units $\hbar =m=1$, which allows us to take the non-relativistic limit by setting the Compton wavelength $% \lambda \rightarrow 0 $. The evolutions of the spin and pseudospin symmetries towards the non-relativistic limit are investigated by solving the Dirac equation with the parameter $\lambda$. With $\lambda$ transformation from the original Compton wavelength to 0, the spin splittings decrease monotonously in all spin doublets, and the pseudospin splittings increase in several pseudospin doublets, no change, or even reduce in several other pseudospin doublets. The various energy splitting behaviors of both the spin and pseudospin doublets with $\lambda$ are well explained by the perturbation calculations of Dirac Hamiltonian in the present units. It indicates that the origin of spin symmetry is entirely due to the relativistic effect, while the origin of pseudospin symmetry cannot be uniquely attributed to the relativistic effect. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

We present a numerical method for performing the multidimensional integrals in the expression for the Bayesian evidence. We use the $p(\gamma,K^+)\Lambda$ data with an invariant energy W > 2.6 GeV in order to constrain the background contributions in the RPR framework with Bayesian inference. Next, the resonance information is extracted from the analysis of differential cross sections, single and double polarization observables. This background and resonance content constitutes the basis of a model which is coined RPR-2011.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1205.2435;A Practical Method to Solve Cut-off Coulomb Problems in the Momentum  Space -- Application to the Lippmann-Schwinger Resonating-Group Method and  the pd Elastic Scattering --; Yoshikazu Fujiwara,  Kenji Fukukawa;"  A practical method to solve cut-off Coulomb problems of two-cluster systems in the momentum space is given. When a sharply cut-off Coulomb force with a cut-off radius $\rho$ is introduced at the level of constituent particles, two-cluster direct potential of the Coulomb force becomes in general a local screened Coulomb potential. The asymptotic Hamiltonian yields two types of asymptotic waves; one is an approximate Coulomb wave with $\rho$ in the middle-range region, and the other a free (no-Coulomb) wave in the longest-range region. The constant Wronskians of this Hamiltonian can be calculated in either region. We can evaluate the Coulomb-modified nuclear phase shifts for the screened Coulomb problem, using the matching condition proposed by Vincent and Phatak for the sharply cut-off Coulomb problem. We apply this method first to an exactly solvable model of the $\alpha \alpha$ scattering with the Ali-Bodmer potential and confirm that a complete solution is obtained with a finite $\rho$. The stability of nuclear phase shifts with respect to the change of $\rho$ in some appropriate range is demonstrated in the $\alpha \alpha$ resonating-group method (RGM) using the Minnesota three-range force. An application to the pd elastic scattering is also discussed. ";Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

To show that this is a robust result, we here consider a new interaction from the literature that was used to discuss even-even and odd-even nuclei.

Vretenar;  Relativistic energy density functionals (REDF) provide a complete and accurate, global description of nuclear structure phenomena. A modern semi-empirical functional, adjusted to the nuclear matter equation of state and to empirical masses of deformed nuclei, is applied to studies of shapes of superheavy nuclei. The theoretical framework is tested in a comparison of calculated masses, quadrupole deformations, and potential energy barriers to available data on actinide isotopes. Self-consistent mean-field calculations predict a variety of spherical, axial and triaxial shapes of long-lived superheavy nuclei, and their alpha-decay energies and half-lives are compared to data. A microscopic, REDF-based, quadrupole collective Hamiltonian model is used to study the effect of explicit treatment of collective correlations in the calculation of Q{\alpha} values and half-lives. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

In order to take into account the rotational excitation of the core nucleus $^{30}$Ne, we employ the particle-rotor model (PRM). We compare the results to those in the adiabatic limit of PRM, that is, the Nilsson model, and show that the Nilsson model works reasonably well for the reaction cross sections of $^{31}$Ne. We also investigate the dependence of the reaction cross sections on the ground state properties of $^{31}$Ne, such as the deformation parameter and the p-wave component in the ground state wave function. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

Kruse,  Bira van Kolck,  Pieter Maris,  James P. Vary;"  We study recently proposed ultraviolet and infrared momentum regulators of the model spaces formed by construction of a variational trial wavefunction which uses a complete set of many-body basis states based upon three-dimensional harmonic oscillator (HO) functions. These model spaces are defined by a truncation of the expansion characterized by a counting number ($\mathcal{N}$) and by the intrinsic scale ($\hbar\omega$) of the HO basis; in short by the ordered pair ($\mathcal{N},\hbar\omega$). In this study we choose for $\mathcal{N}$ the truncation parameter $N_{max}$ related to the maximum number of oscillator quanta, above the minimum configuration, kept in the model space. The ultraviolet (uv) momentum cutoff of the continuum is readily mapped onto a defined uv cutoff in this finite model space, but there are two proposed definitions of the infrared (ir) momentum cutoff inherent in a finite-dimensional HO basis. One definition is based upon the lowest momentum difference given by $\hbar\omega$ itself and the other upon the infrared momentum which corresponds to the maximal radial extent used to encompass the many-body system in coordinate space. Extending both the uv cutoff to infinity and the ir cutoff to zero is prescribed for a converged calculation. We calculate the ground state energy of light nuclei with ""bare"" and ""soft"" $NN$ interactions. By doing so, we investigate the behaviors of the uv and ir regulators of model spaces used to describe $^2$H, $^3$H, $^4$He and $^6$He with $NN$ potentials Idaho N$^3$LO and JISP16. We establish practical procedures which utilize these regulators to obtain the extrapolated result from sequences of calculations with model spaces characterized by ($\mathcal{N},\hbar\omega$).

https://arxiv.org/abs/1205.3292;Relation between baryon number fluctuations and experimentally observed  proton number fluctuations in relativistic heavy ion collisions; Masakiyo Kitazawa,  Masayuki Asakawa;  We explore the relation between proton and nucleon number fluctuations in the final state in relativistic heavy ion collisions. It is shown that the correlations between the isospins of nucleons in the final state are almost negligible over a wide range of collision energy. This leads to a factorization of the distribution function of the proton, neutron, and their antiparticles in the final state with binomial distribution functions. Using the factorization, we derive formulas to determine nucleon number cumulants, which are not direct experimental observables, from proton number fluctuations, which are experimentally observable in event-by-event analyses. With a simple treatment for strange baryons, the nucleon number cumulants are further promoted to the baryon number ones. Experimental determination of the baryon number cumulants makes it possible to compare various theoretical studies on them directly with experiments. Effects of nonzero isospin density on this formula are addressed quantitatively. It is shown that the effects are well suppressed over a wide energy range. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1205.3621;Hadron-Quark Crossover and Massive Hybrid Stars with Strangeness; Kota Masuda,  Tetsuo Hatsuda,  Tatsuyuki Takatsuka;  Using the idea of a smooth crossover from the hadronic matter with hyperons to quark matter with strangeness, we show that the maximum mass of neutron stars with quark matter core can be larger than those without quark matter core. This is in contrast to the conventional softening of equation of state due to exotic components at high density. Essential conditions to reach our conclusion are (i) the crossover takes place at relatively low densities, around 3 times the normal nuclear density, and (ii) the quark matter is strongly interacting in the crossover region. By these, the pressure of the system can be greater than that of purely hadronic matter in the crossover region and leads to the maximum mass greater than 2 solar mass. This conclusion is insensitive to the different choice of the hadronic equation of state with hyperons. Several implications of this result to the nuclear incompressibility, the hyperon mixing, and the neutrino cooling are also remarked. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)"

Contributions to the reaction amplitude from diagrams corresponding to impulse approximation as well as NN and \pi N interactions in the final state have been evaluated. The elementary \gamma N\to \pi N operator is taken from the MAID and SAID models. A detailed comparison of the predictions with recent experimental data by the GDH and A2 collaborations at energies below 500 MeV is presented. Reasonable agreement with the data on the yields and cross sections for polarized beam and polarized target has been achieved in all channels. The unpolarized data of the GDH and A2 collaborations have also been analyzed within the approach. A strong overestimation for the neutral channel has been found. At the same time, the model provides a quite satisfactory description of the unpolarized data for the charged channels. The sensitivity of the obtained results to the choice of the elementary \gamma N\to \pi N operator is discussed in detail. The contribution of the \gamma d\to \pi NN reaction to the GDH sum rule for the deuteron up to a photon energy of 1.65 GeV has been evaluated with the result of 235\pm 25 \mub. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.0170;A relativistic coupled-channel formalism for electromagnetic form  factors of 2-body bound states; Elmar P. Biernat,  William H. Klink,  Wolfgang Schweiger;  We discuss a Poincar\'e invariant coupled-channel formalism which is based on the point-form of relativistic quantum mechanics. Electromagnetic scattering of an electron by a 2-body bound state is treated as a 2-channel problem for a Bakamjian-Thomas-type mass operator. In this way retardation effects in the photon-exchange interaction are fully taken into account. The electromagnetic current of the 2-body bound state is then extracted from the one-photon-exchange optical potential. As an application we calculate electromagnetic pion and deuteron form factors. Wrong cluster properties, inherent in the Bakamjian-Thomas framework, are seen to cause spurious (unphysical) contributions in the current. These are separated and eliminated in an unambiguous way such that one is left with a current that has all the desired properties. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

The results from this genuine full three-body calculation are compared with standard reference rates obtained by two sequential two-body processes. The fairly good agreement relies on two different assumptions about the lowest $2^+$ resonance energy. With the same $2^+$ energy the rates from the full three-body calculation are smaller than those of the standard reference. We discuss the rate dependence on the experimentally unknown $2^+$ energy. Substantial deviations from previous results appear for temperatures above 3 GK. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

Haider,  Lon-chang (L.C.)Liu;  The missing-mass spectrum obtained in a recoil-free transfer reaction p($^{27}$Al,$^{3}$He)$\pi^{-}$p'X is analyzed. We find that the observed peak structure arises from the coherent contributions from two reaction processes in the energy region corresponding to a bound eta ($\eta$) meson. In one of the processes the intermediate $\eta$ is captured by the nucleus to form the $\eta$-mesic nucleus $^{25}$Mg$_{\eta}$. In the other process, the $\eta$ does not form $\eta$-nucleus bound state. The interference between these two processes has caused the peak of the spectrum to appear at an $\eta$ binding energy stronger than the actual one. Our analysis also indicates that the data are consistent with an attractive N*(1535)-nucleus interaction at energies below the $\eta$N threshold. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)"

We suggest that studying the production of these hadrons in relativistic heavy ion collisions offer a promising resolution to this problem as yields of exotic hadrons are expected to be strongly affected by their structures. Using the coalescence model for hadron production, we find that compared to the case of a non-exotic hadron with normal quark numbers, the yield of an exotic hadron is typically an order of magnitude smaller when it is a compact multi-quark state and a factor of two or more larger when it is a loosely bound hadronic molecule. We further find that due to the appreciable numbers of charm and bottom quarks produced in heavy ion collisions at RHIC and even larger numbers expected at LHC, some of the newly proposed heavy exotic states could be produced and realistically measured in these experiments. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.1056;Microscopic Formulation of Interacting Boson Model for Rotational Nuclei; Kosuke Nomura,  Takaharu Otsuka,  Noritaka Shimizu,  Lu Guo;  We propose a novel formulation of the Interacting Boson Model (IBM) for rotational nuclei with axially-symmetric strong deformation. The intrinsic structure represented by the potential energy surface (PES) of a given multi-nucleon system has a certain similarity to that of the corresponding multi-boson system. Based on this feature, one can derive an appropriate boson Hamiltonian as already reported. This prescription, however, has a major difficulty in rotational spectra of strongly deformed nuclei: the bosonic moment of inertia is significantly smaller than the corresponding nucleonic one. We present that this difficulty originates in the difference between the rotational response of a nucleon system and that of the corresponding boson system, and could arise even if the PESs of the two systems were identical. We further suggest that the problem can be cured by implementing $\hat{L} \cdot \hat{L}$ term into the IBM Hamiltonian, with coupling constant derived from the cranking approach of Skyrme mean-field models. The validity of the method is confirmed for rare-earth and actinoid nuclei, as their experimental rotational yrast bands are reproduced nicely. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

Wambach;  In 16O and 40Ca an isoscalar, low-energy dipole transition (IS-LED) exhausting approximately 4% of the isoscalar dipole (ISD) energy-weighted sum rule is experimentally known, but conspicuously absent from recent theoretical investigations of ISD strength. The IS-LED mode coincides with the so-called isospin-forbidden E1 transition. We report that for N=Z nuclei up to 100Sn the fully self-consistent Random-Phase-Approximation with finite-range forces, phenomenological and realistic, yields a collective IS-LED mode, typically overestimating its excitation energy, but correctly describing its IS strength and electroexcitation form factor. The presence of E1 strength is solely due to the Coulomb interaction between the protons and the resulting isospin-symmetry breaking. The smallness of its value is related to the form of the transition density, due to translational invariance. The calculated values of E1 and ISD strength carried by the IS-LED depend on the effective interaction used. Attention is drawn to the possibility that in N-not-equal-Z nuclei this distinct mode of IS surface vibration can develop as such or mix strongly with skin modes and thus influence the pygmy dipole strength as well as the ISD strength function. In general, theoretical models currently in use may be unfit to predict its precise position and strength, if at all its existence. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"

We include both $Q \bar Q$, $Q \bar Q g$ and $Q \bar Q q \bar q$ final states as well as photon single-resolved components. Realistic charge densities in nuclei were taken in the calculation. The different components give contributions of the same order of magnitude to the nuclear cross section. The cross sections found here are smaller than those for the diffractive photon-pomeron mechanism and larger than diffractive pomeron-pomeron discussed in the literature. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.1244;Spin polarization phenomena in dense neutron matter at a strong magnetic  field; A. A. Isayev,  J. Yang;  Spin polarized states in neutron matter at strong magnetic fields up to $10^{18}$ G are considered in the model with the Skyrme effective interaction. Analyzing the self-consistent equations at zero temperature, it is shown that a thermodynamically stable branch of solutions for the spin polarization parameter as a function of density corresponds to the negative spin polarization when the majority of neutron spins are oriented oppositely to the direction of the magnetic field. Besides, it is found that in a strong magnetic field the state with the positive spin polarization can be realized as a metastable state at the high density region in neutron matter. At finite temperature, the entropy of the thermodynamically stable branch demonstrates the unusual behavior being larger than that for the nonpolarized state (at vanishing magnetic field) above certain critical density which is caused by the dependence of the entropy on the effective masses of neutrons in a spin polarized state. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.1487;Non-degenerate shell-model effective interactions from the  Okamoto-Suzuki and Krenciglowa-Kuo iteration methods; Huan Dong,  T.T.S.Kuo,  J.W.Holt;  We present calculations of shell-model effective interactions for both degenerate and non-degenerate model spaces using the Krenciglowa-Kuo (KK) and the extended Krenciglowa-Kuo iteration method recently developed by Okamoto, Suzuki {\it et al.} (EKKO). The starting point is the low-momentum nucleon-nucleon interaction $V_{low-k}$ obtained from the N$^3$LO chiral two-nucleon interaction. The model spaces spanned by the $sd$ and $sdpf$ shells are both considered. With a solvable model, we show that both the KK and EKKO methods are convenient for deriving the effective interactions for non-degenerate model spaces. The EKKO method is especially desirable in this situation since the vertex function $\hat Z$-box employed therein is well behaved while the corresponding vertex function $\hat Q$-box employed in the Lee-Suzuki (LS) and KK methods may have singularities. The converged shell-model effective interactions given by the EKKO and KK methods are equivalent, although the former method is considerably more efficient. The degenerate $sd$-shell effective interactions given by the LS method are practically identical to those from the EKKO and KK methods. Results of the $sd$ one-shell and $sdpf$ two-shell calculations for $^{18}$O, $^{18}$F, $^{19}$O and $^{19}$F using the EKKO effective interactions are compared, and the importance of the shell-model three-nucleon forces is discussed. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

Using the PYTHIA and HIJING event generators we produce a sample of events which mimic experimental data.

The data confirm the validity of the convolution model, describing the spectral function (SF) of a correlated pair moving in the mean field with high and low relative and center-of-mass (cm) momenta, respectively. The model is built assuming that the wave function (WF) of a nucleus A, describing a configuration where the cm momentum of a correlated pair is low and its relative momentum is high, factorizes into the product of the two-body WF and that of the A-2 system. Such a factorization has been shown to occur in nuclear matter (NM). Here it is shown that few-body systems exhibit factorization, which seems to be therefore a general property, to be reproduced also in studies of the WF of finite nuclei. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)"

By using a realistic, non-relativistic microscopic approach for the evaluation of GPDs of 3He, it will be shown that conventional nuclear effects, such as isospin and binding ones, or the uncertainty related to the use of a given nucleon-nucleon potential, are bigger than in the forward case so that, if great attention is not paid, conventional nuclear effects can be easily mistaken for exotic ones. It is stressed that 3He, for which the best realistic calculations are possible, represents a unique target to discriminate between conventional and exotic effects. The complementary information which could be obtained by using a 3H target, the possible extraction of the neutron information, as well as the relevance of a relativistic treatment, will be also addressed. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.1927;Gauge-invariant formulation of $N N \to N N γ$; H. Haberzettl,  K. Nakayama;"  A complete, rigorous relativistic field-theory formulation of the nucleon-nucleon (NN) bremsstrahlung reaction is presented. The resulting amplitude is unitary as a matter of course and it is gauge invariant, i.e., it satisfies a generalized Ward-Takahashi identity. The novel feature of this approach is the consistent microscopic implementation of local gauge invariance across all interaction mechanisms of the hadronic systems, thus serving as a constraint for all subprocesses. The formalism is quite readily adapted to approximations and thus can be applied even in cases where the microscopic dynamical structure of the underlying interacting hadronic systems is either not known in detail or too complex to be treated in detail. We point out how the interaction currents resulting from the photon being attached to nucleon-nucleon-meson vertices can be treated by phenomenological four-point contact currents that preserve gauge invariance. In an advance application of the present formalism [K. Nakayama and H. Haberzettl, PRC 80, 051001(R) (2009)], such interaction currents were found to contribute significantly in explaining experimental data. In addition, we provide a scheme that permits the approximate treatment of current contributions resulting from pieces of the NN interaction that cannot be incorporated exactly. In each case, the approximation procedure ensures gauge invariance of the entire bremsstrahlung amplitude. We also discuss the necessary modifications when taking into account baryonic states other than the nucleon N; in detail, we consider the $Delta(1232)$ resonance by incorporating the couplings of the $NN$ to the $N\Delta$ and $\Delta\Delta$ systems, and the $\gamma N \to \Delta$ transitions. We apply the formalism to the 280-MeV bremsstrahlung data from TRIUMF [PRD 41, 2689 (1990)] incorporating $\gamma N\Delta$ transition currents and find good agreement with the data.

Introducing a new operator in place of the Q-box in the Krenciglowa-Kuo (KK) method, we derive a new equation for the effective interaction. This equation can be viewed as an extension of the KK method. We show that this equation can be solved both in iterative and non-iterative ways. We observe that the iteration procedure brings about fast acceleration of convergence compared to the KK approach. We also find that the non-iterative calculation reproduces successfully any set of the true eigenvalues of the original Hamiltonian. This non-iterative calculation can be made regardless of the magnitudes of the overlaps with the model space and the energy differences between the unperturbed energy and the eigenvalues to be solved. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

In particular it is not possible to reproduce the three- and four-nucleon binding energies and the $n-d$ scattering length simultaneously. This is one manifestation of the necessity of including a three-nucleon force in the nuclear Hamiltonian. In this paper we perform an analysis of some, widely used, three-nucleon force models. We analyze their capability to describe the aforementioned quantities and, to improve their description, we propose modifications in the parametrization of the models.

For fermions, the numerical evaluation of such fluctuations requires the use of a time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) code. Proton, neutron and total nucleon number fluctuations in fragments produced in collisions of two 40Ca are computed for a large range of angular momenta at a center of mass energy E_cm=128 MeV, well above the fusion barrier. For deep-inelastic collisions, the fluctuations calculated from the BV variational principle are much larger than standard TDHF results, and closer to mass and charge experimental fluctuations. For the first time, correlations between proton and neutron numbers are determined within a quantum microscopic approach. These correlations are shown to be larger with exotic systems where charge equilibration occurs. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

The dynamics is treated within Fermionic Molecular Dynamics (FMD) which uses a Gaussian wave-packet basis to represent the many-body states. A phase-shift equivalent effective interaction derived within the Unitary Correlation Operator Method (UCOM) that treats explicitly short-range central and tensor correlations is employed.

Within the FMD approach the microscopic many-body wave functions of the 3/2- and 1/2- bound states in 7Be as well as the many-body scattering states in the 1/2+, 3/2+ and 5/2+ channels are calculated as eigenstates of the same microscopic effective Hamiltonian. Finally the S-factor is calculated from E1 transition matrix elements between the many-body scattering and bound states. For 3He(alpha,gamma)7Be the S-factor agrees very well, both in absolute normalization and energy dependence, with the recent experimental data from the Weizmann, LUNA, Seattle and ERNA experiments.

Coupling viscous fluid dynamics for the QGP with a microscopic transport model for hadronic freeze-out we find that the eccentricity-scaled elliptic flow is a universal function of charged multiplicity per unit overlap area, (1/S)(dN_ch/dy), that depends only on the viscosity but not on the model used for computing the initial fireball eccentricity. Comparing with measurements we find 1 < (4pi)(eta/s)_QGP < 2.5 where the uncertainty range is dominated by model uncertainties for the eccentricity values used to normalize the measured elliptic flow. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"

The calculated rates are about 15% of the derived rates, depending weakly on the depth of the threshold K- nuclear potential. The A dependence of the calculated rates is in fair agreement with that of the derived rates, showing a slight preference for a deep density dependent K- nuclear potential of depth (150-200) MeV at nuclear matter density over a shallow potential of depth about 50 MeV.

Rather than using the canonical hydrodynamical expansion of the distribution function around an isotropic equilibrium state, we expand around a state which is anisotropic in momentum space and parameterize this state in terms of three proper-time and spatial-rapidity dependent parameters. Deviations from the Bjorken scaling solutions are naturally taken into account by the time evolution of the spatial-rapidity dependence of the anisotropic ansatz. As a result, we obtain three coupled partial differential equations for the momentum-space anisotropy, the typical momentum of the degrees of freedom, and the longitudinal flow. Within this framework (0+1)-dimensional Bjorken expansion is obtained as an asymptotic limit. Finally, we make quantitative comparisons of the temporal and spatial-rapidity evolution of the dynamical parameters and resulting pressure anisotropy in both the strong and weak coupling limits. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.3354;Torqued fireballs in relativistic heavy-ion collisions; Piotr Bozek,  Wojciech Broniowski,  Joao Moreira;  We show that the fluctuations in the wounded-nucleon model of the initial stage of relativistic heavy-ion collisions, together with the natural assumption that the forward (backward) moving wounded nucleons emit particles preferably in the forward (backward) direction, lead to an event-by-event torqued fireball. The principal axes associated with the transverse shape are rotated in the forward region in the opposite direction than in the backward region. On the average, the standard deviation of the relative torque angle between the forward and backward rapidity regions is about 20deg for the central and 10deg for the mid-peripheral collisions. The hydrodynamic expansion of a torqued fireball leads to a torqued collective flow, yielding, in turn, torqued principal axes of the transverse-momentum distributions at different rapidities. We propose experimental measures, based on cumulants involving particles in different rapidity regions, which should allow for a quantitative determination of the effect from the data. To estimate the non-flow contributions from resonance decays we run Monte Carlo simulations with THERMINATOR. If the event-by-event torque effect is found in the data, it will support the assumptions concerning the fluctuations in the early stage of the fireball formation, as well as the hypothesis of the asymmetric rapidity shape of the emission functions of the moving sources in the nucleus-nucleus collisions. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"

A double-peak structure for the associated particles at the away side of trigger particles is obtained after subtracting background correlations due to the elliptic flow. Both the near-side peak and the away-side double peaks in the azimuthal angular correlations are, however, significantly suppressed (enhanced) in events of small (large) triangular flow, which are present as a result of fluctuations in the initial collision geometry. After subtraction of background correlations due to the triangular flow, the away-side double peaks change into a single peak with broad shoulders on both sides. The away side of the di-hadron correlations becomes essentially a single peak after further subtraction of higher-order flows. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.3866;Curvature effect on nuclear pasta: Is it helpful for gyroid appearance?; Ken'ichiro Nakazato,  Kei Iida,  Kazuhiro Oyamatsu;  In supernova cores and neutron star crusts, nuclei are thought to deform to rodlike and slablike shapes, which are often called nuclear pasta. We study the equilibrium properties of the nuclear pasta by using a liquid drop model with curvature corrections. It is confirmed that the curvature effect acts to lower the transition densities between different shapes. We also examine the gyroid structure, which was recently suggested as a different type of nuclear pasta by analogy with the polymer systems. The gyroid structure investigated in this paper is approximately formulated as an extension of the periodic minimal surface whose mean curvature vanishes. In contrast to our expectations, we find from the present approximate formulation that the curvature corrections act to slightly disfavor the appearance of the gyroid structure. By comparing the energy corrections in the gyroid phase and the hypothetical phases composed of d-dimensional spheres, where d is a general dimensionality, we show that the gyroid is unlikely to belong to a family of the generalized dimensional spheres. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)"

For the simple case of noninteracting identical particles, we show how the fourth-order source cumulant can be determined from measured cumulants in momentum space. The textbook Gram-Charlier series is found to be highly inaccurate, while the related Edgeworth series provides increasingly accurate estimates. Ordering of terms compatible with the Central Limit Theorem appears to play a crucial role even for nongaussian distributions. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.4085;Evolving Nuclear Many-Body Forces with the Similarity Renormalization  Group; E.D. Jurgenson,  P. Navratil,  R.J. Furnstahl;  In recent years, the Similarity Renormalization Group has provided a powerful and versatile means to soften interactions for ab initio nuclear calculations. The substantial contribution of both induced and initial three-body forces to the nuclear interaction has required the consistent evolution of free-space Hamiltonians in the three-particle space. We present the most recent progress on this work, extending the calculational capability to the p-shell nuclei and showing that the hierarchy of induced many-body forces is consistent with previous estimates. Calculations over a range of the flow parameter for 6Li, including fully evolved NN+3N interactions, show moderate contributions due to induced four-body forces and display the same improved convergence properties as in lighter nuclei. A systematic analysis provides further evidence that the hierarchy of many-body forces is preserved. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

Recently the processes: $gg \rightarrow ggg$ has been revisited and a correction to the widely used Gunion-Bertsch (GB) formula has been obtained. The $\eta$ and $\zeta$ have been evaluated for gluonic fluid with the formula derived recently. The sensitivity of the quantity, $\eta/s$ on the running coupling constant is also discussed. At $\alpha_s=0.3$ we get $\eta/s=0.24$ which is close to the value obtained from the analysis of the elliptic flow at RHIC experiments. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)"

For shapes with multipolarity six, the isomers are more tightly bound and, microscopically, have enhanced deformed shell gaps at $N=152$ and $Z=100$.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.4280;Scalar field in nuclear matter: the roles of spontaneous chiral symmetry  breaking and nucleon structure; G. Chanfray (IPNL),  M. Ericson (IPNL, CERN);  Chiral theories with spontaneous symmetry breaking such as the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model lead to the existence of a scalar mode. We present in a detailed manner how the corresponding low momentum effective lagrangian involving the scalar field can be constructed starting from the NJL model. We discuss the relevance of the scalar mode for the problem of the nuclear binding and saturation. We show that it depends on the nucleon mass origin with two extreme cases. If this origin is entirely due to confinement the coupling of this mode to the nucleons vanishes, making it irrelevant for the nuclear binding problem. If instead it is entirely due to spontaneous symmetry breaking it couples to the nucleons but nuclear matter collapses. It is only in the case of a mixed origin with spontaneous breaking that nuclear matter can be stable and reach saturation. We describe models of nucleon structure where this balance is achieved. We also show how chiral constraints and confinement modify the QCD sum rules for the mass evolution in nuclear matter. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.4289;Effects of nuclear absorption on the antiLambda/antiproton ratio in  relativistic heavy ion collisions; Fuqiang Wang,  Marlene Nahrgang,  Marcus Bleicher;  An enhanced antiLambda/antiproton ratio in heavy-ion relative to p+p collisions has been proposed as one of the signatures for the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) formation. A significantly large (antiLambda+antiSigma0+1.1*antiSigma-)/antiproton ratio of 3.5 has been observed in the mid-rapidity and low transverse momentum region in central Au+Au collisions at the nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 4.9 GeV at the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS). This is an order of magnitude larger than the values in peripheral Au+Au collisions and p+p collisions at the corresponding energy. By using the Ultra-relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) transport model, we demonstrate that the observed large ratio can be explained by strong absorption of antiprotons (~99.9%) and antiLambdas (~99%) in dense nuclear matter created in central collisions. We find within the model that the initial antiLambda/antiproton ratio, mainly from string fragmentation, does not depend on the collision centrality, and is consistent with that observed in p+p collisions. This suggests that the observed large (antiLambda+antiSigma0+1.1*antiSigma-)/antiproton ratio at the AGS does not necessarily imply the formation of the QGP. We further study the excitation function of the ratio in UrQMD, which may help in the search and study of the QGP. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.4316;Probing the Frontiers of QCD; W. A. Horowitz;"  With the energy scales opened up by RHIC and LHC the age of high-pT physics is upon us. This has created new opportunities and novel mysteries, both of which will be explored in this thesis. The possibility now exists experimentally to exploit these high momentum particles to uniquely probe the unprecedented state of matter produced in heavy ion collisions. At the same time naive theoretical expectations have been dashed by data. The first puzzle we confront is that of the enormous intermediate-pT azimuthal anisotropy, or v2, of jets observed at RHIC. The second puzzle is the surprisingly similar suppression of light mesons and nonphotonic electrons, which precludes perturbative predictions predicated on gluon bremsstrahlung radiation as the dominant energy loss channel. Near qualitative agreement results from including collisional energy loss and integrating over the fluctuating jet pathlengths. Another conjecture for heavy quark energy loss comes via explicit construction using the AdS/CFT correspondence; the momentum loss of a hanging dragging string moving through the deconfined plasma leads to qualitative agreement with heavy quark decay data. We propose a robust test to experimentally differentiate these two competing ideas: the ratio of charm to bottom suppression rapidly approaches 1 for pQCD but is independent of momentum and well below 1 for AdS/CFT. Finally as a warmup problem to calculating the photon bremsstrahlung associated with jet energy loss we quantify improvements to the perturbative estimates of the Ter-Mikayelian effect.

Wysocki;  Understanding the detailed production and hadronization mechanisms for heavy quarkonia and their modification in a nuclear environment presents one of the major challenges in QCD. Calculations including nuclear-modified parton distribution functions (nPDFs) and fitting of break-up cross sections (sigma_breakup) as parameters have been successful at describing many features of J/psi modification in proton(deuteron)-nucleus collisions. In this paper, we extend these calculations to explore different geometric dependencies of the modification and confront them with new experimental results from the PHENIX experiment. We find that no combination of nPDFs and sigma_breakup, regardless of the nPDF parameter set and the assumed geometric dependence, can simultaneously describe the entire rapidity and centrality dependence of J/psi modifications in d+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV. We also compare the data with coherence calculations and find them unable to describe the full rapidity and centrality dependence as well. We discuss how these calculations might be extended and further tested, in addition to discussing other physics mechanisms including initial-state parton energy loss. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"

The nn 1S0 interaction is shown to be dominant in that configuration and has to be increase to bring theory and data into agreement. Using the next-to-leading order (NLO) 1S0 interaction of chiral perturbation theory (chiPT) we demonstrate that the nn QFS cross section only slightly depends on changes of the nn scattering length but is very sensitive to variations of the effective range parameter. In order to account for the reported discrepancies one must decrease the nn effective range parameter by about 12 % from its value implied by 19charge symmetry and charge independence of nuclear forces. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

Numerical simulation of the Kadanoff-Baym equation for the non-Abelian gauge theory is performed in 2+1 dimensions. Starting from anisotropic distribution in momentum space, relaxation to isotropic distribution proceeds and the entropy is produced due to off-shell scattering of massive transverse polarization mode as expected from the proof of the H-theorem. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)"

The posteriors probabilities for each data model are computed using a Nested sampling integration. From this analysis we concluded that $C_{x'}$ and $C_{z'}$ double polarizations require two and three order of associated Legendre polynomials respectively to describe the data well.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.4895;An One Dimensional Adiabatic Model for Fusion Involving Loosely Bound  and Halo Nuclei with Heavy Targets; Ajit Kumar Mohanty;  An one dimensional adiabatic model has been proposed for fusion of loosely bound and halo light nuclei with various heavy targets. It is shown that fusion cross sections at near and sub-barrier energies can be explained using a simple WKB tunneling through an adiabatic barrier without invoking breakup coupling explicitly. The model has been applied successfully to explain fusion cross sections for several systems including recently measured $^{6}Li+^{198}Pt$ system (Phy. Rev. Lett. 103, 232702, 2009) where data exists well above and below the barrier and $^{8}He+^{197}Au$ system (Phy. Rev. Lett. 103, 232701, 2009) where $^{8}He$ is highly neutron rich. Interestingly, the fusion of stable $^{4}He+^{197}Au$ system can not be explained on the basis of this adiabatic model as it requires normal tunneling through the sudden barrier. The requirement of adiabatic potential for the loosely bound and halo nuclei is linked to the fact that for such systems neutron flow leading to neck formation is initiated at a larger distance which modifies the sudden potential. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

Gibson;"  Background: Direct measurement of the electric dipole moment (EDM) of the neutron lies in the future; measurement of a nuclear EDM may well come first. The deuteron is one nucleus for which exact model calculations are feasible. Purpose: We explore the model dependence of deuteron EDM calculations. Methods: Using a separable potential formulation of the Hamiltonian, we examine the sensitivity of the deuteron EDM to variation in the nucleon-nucleon interaction. We write the EDM as the sum of two terms, the first depending on the target wave function with plane-wave intermediate states, and the second depending on intermediate multiple scattering in the 3P1 channel, the latter being sensitive to the off-shell behavior of the 3P1 amplitude. Results: We compare the full calculation with the plane-wave approximation result, examine the tensor force contribution to the model results, and explore the effect of short range repulsion found in realistic, contemporary potential models of the deuteron. Conclusions: Because one-pion exchange dominates the EDM calculation, separable potential model calculations will provide an adequate description of the 2H EDM until such time as a better than 10% measurement is obtained.

A double folding procedure is applied to take into account the energy-dependent width effects beyond RPA. All the considered Skyrme forces indicate a soft prolate deformation in the open shell isotopes $^{142-164}$Sn. The integrated E1 strength in the energy region of the pygmy resonance grows with the neutron number. The influence of deformation on the integrated strength near the particle emission thresholds (which is of a keen astrophysical interest) is strictly suppressed by the mutual compensation effect for the branches of the giant dipole resonance.

The net back-to-back dihadron correlation after subtraction of harmonic flows still has a double-peak that is independent of the initial geometric triangularity at a fixed impact-parameter and unique to the structure of jet-induced Mach cone and expanding hot spots dragged by radial flow. The longitudinal structure of hot spots also leads to a near-side ridge in dihadron correlation with a large rapidity gap. By successively randomizing the azimuthal angle of the transverse momenta and positions of initial partons, one can isolate the effects of jet-induced medium excitation and expanding hot spots on the dihadron azimuthal correlation with both small and large rapidity gap. The double-peak in the net dihadron correlation is quantitatively different from that in $\gamma$-hadron that is free of the contributions from harmonic flow and hot spots and caused only by jet-induced Mach cone. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"

We find relatively frame independent results and good agreement with experiment especially for the lower momentum transfers. This agreement occurs when we neglect an omega-dependent piece of the one-body current relativistic correction. An inclusion of this term leads however to a rather pronounced frame dependence at q=700 MeV/c. A discussion of this term is given here.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.5589;Energy and system-size dependence of the Chiral Magnetic Effect; V.Toneev,  V.Voronyuk;  The energy dependence of the local ${\cal P}$ and ${\cal CP}$ violation in Au+Au and Cu+Cu collisions in a large energy range is estimated within a simple phenomenological model. It is expected that at LHC the chiral magnetic effect will be about 20 times weaker than at RHIC. At lower energy range, covered by the low-energy scan at RHIC and future NICA/FAIR facilities, the created magnetic field strength and energy density of deconfined matter are rather high providing necessary conditions for the chiral magnetic effect. However, the particular model for the chiral magnetic effect predicts that this effect should vanish sharply at energy somewhere above the top SPS one. To elucidate CME background effects the Hadron-String-Dynamics (HSD) transport model including electromagnetic fields is put forward. Importance of new planning experiments at LHC and for the low-energy RHIC scan program is emphasized. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"

Gupta;  A new microscopic nucleon-nucleon (NN) interaction has been derived for the first time from the popular relativistic mean field theory (RMFT) Lagrangian. The NN interaction so obtained remarkably relate to the inbuilt fundamental parameters of RMFT. Furthermore, by folding it with the RMFT-densities of cluster and daughter nuclei to obtain the optical potential, it's application is also examined to study the exotic cluster radioactive decays, and results obtained found comparable with the successfully used M3Y phenomenological effective NN interactions. The presently derived NN-interaction can also be used to calculate a number of other nuclear observables. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.5773;Collective flow and long-range correlations in relativistic heavy ion  collisions; Matthew Luzum;"  Making use of recently released data on dihadron correlations by the STAR collaboration, I analyze the long-range (""ridge-like"") part of these data and show that the dependence on both transverse momentum as well as orientation with respect to the event plane are consistent with correlations expected from only collective flow. In combination with previously analyzed centrality-dependent data, they provide strong evidence that only collective flow effects are present at large relative pseudorapidy. In contrast, by analyzing a ""background subtracted"" signal, the authors presenting the new data concluded that the ridge-like part of the measured correlation could not in fact be entirely generated from collective flow of the medium. I explain the discrepancy and illustrate some pitfalls of using the ZYAM prescription to remove flow background.

A short proper time for hadronization is assumed. The predictions are compared with recent experimental measurements of elliptic flow which have been made for this colliding system and energy. It is found that the model predictions do a reasonable job in describing the experimental results, suggesting that the parton phase in these collisions may be short-lived. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)"

The new data point is used to carry out a combined fit together with the RHIC data to reduce the uncertainty in the gluon shadowing parameter $s_{g}$ which controls the overall magnitude of gluon shadowing at small fractional momentum $x$ in HIJING2.0 model. Predictions on the centrality dependence of charged hadron multiplicity density at mid-rapidity with reduced uncertainty are given for $Pb+Pb$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=2.76$ and 5.5 TeV. The centrality dependence is surprisingly independent of the colliding energy as compared to RHIC energy for most of centralities starting at $N_{\rm part}=50$ (100) at $\sqrt{s}=2.76$ (7) TeV. However, it becomes stronger in peripheral collisions at higher colliding energies. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.0019;Selfconsistent Evaluation of Charm and Charmonium in the Quark-Gluon  Plasma; Felix Riek,  Ralf Rapp;"  A selfconsistent calculation of heavy-quark (HQ) and quarkonium properties in the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) is conducted to quantify flavor transport and color screening in the medium. The main tool is a thermodynamic $T$-matrix approach to compute HQ and quarkonium spectral functions in both scattering and bound-state regimes. The $T$-matrix, in turn, is employed to calculate HQ selfenergies which are implemented into spectral functions beyond the quasiparticle approximation. Charmonium spectral functions are used to evaluate eulcidean-time correlation functions which are compared to results from thermal lattice QCD. The comparisons are performed in various hadronic channels including zero-mode contributions consistently accounting for finite charm-quark width effects. The zero modes are closely related to the charm-quark number susceptibility which is also compared to existing lattice ""data"". Both the susceptibility and the heavy-light quark $T$-matrix are applied to calculate the thermal charm-quark relaxation rate, or, equivalently, the charm diffusion constant in the QGP. Implications of our findings in the HQ sector for the viscosity-to-entropy-density ratio of the QGP are briefly discussed.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.0252;Dilepton production in the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma; O. Linnyk,  W. Cassing,  E. L. Bratkovskaya,  J. Manninen;  Dilepton production in relativistic heavy-ion collisions is studied within the microscopic Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) transport approach, which is based on a dynamical quasiparticle model (DQPM) matched to reproduce lattice QCD results in thermodynamic equilibrium. A comparison to the data of the NA60 Collaboration for In+In collisions at 158 AGeV shows that the dilepton spectra are well described by the sum of hadronic and partonic sources, if a collisional broadening of vector mesons is taken into account as well as the off-shell quark-antiquark annihilation (q+qbar->l^+l^- and q+qbar->gl^+l^-) in the QGP. In particular, the observed softening of the mT spectra at intermediate masses is reproduced. The data of the PHENIX collaboration on dilepton production in Au+Au collisions at sqrt(s)=200 GeV for masses above 1 GeV are found to be dominated by the contributions of the QGP radiation and the charm meson decays, while the measured spectrum is underestimated in the mass range from 0.2 to 0.6 GeV. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.0293;Final-state interactions in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering off  the Deuteron; Wim Cosyn,  Misak Sargsian;  Semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering off the Deuteron with production of a slow nucleon in recoil kinematics is studied in the virtual nucleon approximation, in which the final state interaction (FSI) is calculated within general eikonal approximation. The cross section is derived in a factorized approach, with a factor describing the virtual photon interaction with the off-shell nucleon and a distorted spectral function accounting for the final-state interactions. One of the main goals of the study is to understand how much the general features of the diffractive high energy soft rescattering accounts for the observed features of FSI in deep inelastic scattering(DIS). Comparison with the Jefferson Lab data shows good agreement in the covered range of kinematics. Most importantly, our calculation correctly reproduces the rise of the FSI in the forward direction of the slow nucleon production angle. By fitting our calculation to the data we extracted the $W$ and $Q^2$ dependences of the total cross section and slope factor of the interaction of DIS products, $X$, off the spectator nucleon. This analysis shows the $XN$ scattering cross section rising with $W$ and decreasing with an increase of $Q^2$. Finally, our analysis points at a largely suppressed off-shell part of the rescattering amplitude. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"

The study is also extended to the case of two different types of anharmonic oscillations of density. We point several qualitative effects due to the anharmonicity, although quantitatively they appear to be relatively small. We also find that, in most regions of the parameter space, with the exception of the case of a very large amplitude of density oscillations (i.e. 10% and above), nonlinear effects and anharmonicity have a small effect on the interplay of the nonleptonic and semileptonic processes in the bulk viscosity. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.0394;A New Approach to Physics of Nuclei; E. G. Drukarev,  M. G. Ryskin,  V. A. Sadovnikova (Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute);  We employ the QCD sum rules method for description of nucleons in nuclear matter. We show that this approach provides a consistent formalism for solving various problems of nuclear physics. Such nucleon characteristics as the Dirac effective mass $m^*$ and the vector self-energy $\Sigma_V$ are expressed in terms of the in-medium values of QCD condensates. The values of these parameters at saturation density and the dependence on the baryon density and on the neutron-to-proton density ratio is in agreement with the results, obtained by conventional nuclear physics method. The contributions to $m^*$ and $\Sigma_V$ are related to observables and do not require phenomenological parameters. The scalar interaction is shown to be determined by the pion--nucleon $\sigma$-term. The nonlinear behavior of the scalar condensate may appear to provide a possible mechanism of the saturation. The approach provided reasonable results for renormalization of the axial coupling constant, for the contribution of the strong interactions to the neutron--proton mass difference and for the behavior of the structure functions of the in-medium nucleon. The approach enables to solve the problems which are difficult or unaccessible for conventional nuclear physics methods. The method provides guide-lines for building the nuclear forces. The three-body interactions emerge within the method in a natural way. There rigorous calculation will be possible in framework of self-consistent calculation in nuclear matter of the scalar condensate and of the nucleon effective mass $m^*$. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)"

We use a selfconsistent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov formalism based on the Gogny energy density functional with two parametrizations, D1S and D1M, and implemented with the equal filling approximation. We find clear signatures of a sharp shape transition at N=60 in both charge radii and spin-parity of the ground states, which are robust, consistent to each other, and in agreement with experiment. We point out that the combined analysis of these two observables could be used to predict unambiguously new regions where shape transitions might develop. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

It is found that with the help of nuclear effective field theory (NEFT), not only the quark mass dependence of the effective range parameters, but also the leading quark mass dependence of all the low energy deuteron matrix elements can be obtained. The quark mass dependence of deuteron charge radius, magnetic moment, polarizability and the deuteron photodisintegration cross section are shown based on the NPLQCD lattice calculation of the scattering lengths at 354 MeV pion mass and the NEFT power counting scheme of Beane, Kaplan and Vuorinen. Further improvement can be obtained by performing the lattice calculation at smaller quark masses. Our result can be used to constrain the time variation of isoscalar combination of u and d quark mass m_q, to help the anthropic principle study to find the m_q range which allows the existence of life, and to provide a weak test of the multiverse conjecture. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)"

That relation is revealed when these matrix elements are expressed as functions of the relative distance $r$ between the pair of neutrons that are transformed into a pair of protons in the $\beta\beta$ decay. Analyzing this relation allows us to understand the contrasting behavior of these matrix elements when $A$ and $Z$ is changed; while $M^{0\nu}_{GT}$ changes slowly and smoothly, $M^{2\nu}$ has pronounced shell effects. We also discuss the possibility of phenomenological determination of the $M^{2\nu}_{cl}$ and from them of the $M^{0\nu}_{GT}$ values from the experimental study of the $\beta^{\pm}$ strength functions.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.0555;Viscous QCD matter in a hybrid hydrodynamic+Boltzmann approach; Huichao Song (LBNL & Ohio State),  Steffen A. Bass (Duke U.),  Ulrich W. Heinz (Ohio State);  A hybrid transport approach for the bulk evolution of viscous QCD matter produced in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions is presented. The expansion of the dense deconfined phase of the reaction is modeled with viscous hydrodynamics while the dilute late hadron gas stage is described microscopically by the Boltzmann equation. The advantages of such a hybrid approach lie in the improved capability of handling large dissipative corrections in the late dilute phase of the reaction, including a realistic treatment of the non-equilibrium hadronic chemistry and kinetic freeze-out. By varying the switching temperature at which the hydrodynamic output is converted to particles for further propagation with the Boltzmann cascade we test the ability of the macroscopic hydrodynamic approach to emulate the microscopic evolution during the hadronic stage and extract the temperature dependence of the effective shear viscosity of the hadron resonance gas produced in the collision. We find that the extracted values depend on the prior hydrodynamic history and hence do not represent fundamental transport properties of the hadron resonance gas. We conclude that viscous fluid dynamics does not provide a faithful description of hadron resonance gas dynamics with predictive power, and that both components of the hybrid approach are needed for a quantitative description of the fireball expansion and its freeze-out. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.0728;Comparison of radiative energy loss models in a hot QCD medium; Marta Verweij;  The suppression of high $p_{T}$ hadron production in heavy ion collisions is thought to be due to energy loss by gluon radiation off hard partons in a QCD medium. Existing models of QCD radiative energy loss in a color-charged medium give estimates of the coupling strength of the parton to the medium which differ by a factor of $5$. We will present a side-by-side comparison of two different formalisms to calculate the energy loss of light quarks and gluons: the multiple soft scattering approximation (ASW-MS) and the opacity expansion formalism (ASW-SH and WHDG-rad). A common time-temperature profile is used to characterize the medium. The results are compared to the single hadron suppression $R_{AA}$ at RHIC energies. In addition the influcence of homogeneous and non-homogeneous distribution of scattering centers is discussed. We find that using an equivalent brick overestimates the energy loss for long parton trajectories. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

These equations are then used to describe the evolution dynamics of relativistic heavy-ion collisions by taking the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio of $1/4\pi$ for the initial quark-gluon plasma (QGP) phase and of ten times this value for the later hadron-gas (HG) phase. Using the production rate evaluated with particle distributions that take into account the viscous effect, we study dilepton production in central heavy-ion collisions. Compared with results from the ideal hydrodynamics, we find that although the dilepton invariant mass spectra from the two approaches are similar, the transverse momentum spectra are significantly enhanced at high transverse momenta by the viscous effect. We also study the transverse momentum dependence of dileptons produced from QGP for a fixed transverse mass which is essentially absent in the ideal hydrodynamics, and find that this so-called transverse mass scaling is violated in the viscous hydrodynamics, particularly at high transverse momenta. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)"

Then we present in more detail a semiclassical theory of shell effects, also developed by Strutinsky following original ideas of M. Gutzwiller. We emphasize, in particular, the influence of orbit bifurcations on shell structure. We first give a short overview of semiclassical trace formulae, which connect the shell oscillations of a quantum system with a sum over periodic orbits of the corresponding classical system, in what is usually called the ""periodic orbit theory"". We then present a case study in which the gross features of a typical double-humped nuclear fission barrier, including the effects of mass asymmetry, can be obtained in terms of the shortest periodic orbits of a cavity model with realistic deformations relevant for nuclear fission. Next we investigate shell structures in a spheroidal cavity model which is integrable and allows for far-going analytical computation. We show, in particular, how period-doubling bifurcations are closely connected to the existence of the so-called ""superdeformed"" energy minimum which corresponds to the fission isomer of actinide nuclei. Finally, we present a general class of radial power-law potentials which approximate well the shape of a Woods-Saxon potential in the bound region, give analytical trace formulae for it and discuss various limits (including the harmonic oscillator and the spherical box potentials).

Basis set methods such as no-core shell model and coupled-cluster techniques typically use softer non-local potentials because of their more rapid convergence with basis set size. These non-local potentials are usually defined in momentum space and are often based on effective field theory. Comparisons of the results of the two types of methods can be difficult when different potentials are used. We show methods for evaluating the real-space imaginary-time propagators needed to perform quantum Monte Carlo calculations using such non-local potentials. We explore the universality of the large imaginary time propagators for different potentials and discuss how non-local potentials can be used in quantum Monte Carlo calculations. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

They turn out to be capable of producing a qualitative change on the strength distribution in this channel. The effect on the deformation properties is also discussed.

Next, Lambda 8Li, Lambda 8Be, and Lambda 9Li are considered, both to exhibit features of Lambda-Sigma coupling and as possible source of observed, but unassigned, hypernuclear gamma rays. Then, the feasibility of measuring the ground-state doublet spacing of Lambda 10Be, which, like Lambda 9Li, could be studied via the (K-,pi0 gamma) reaction, is investigated. Structural information relevant to the population of states in these hypernuclei in recent (e,e'K+) studies is also given. Finally, the extension of the shell-model calculations to sd-shell hypernuclei is briefly considered. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"

Ducoin;  The equation of state and composition of the inner crust of neutron stars at zero temperature are calculated, using the T = 0 version of the TETFSI (temperature-dependent extended Thomas-Fermi plus Strutinsky integral) method, for each of a family of three functionals based on Skyrme-type forces BSk19, BSk20 and BSk21, which are characterized by different degrees of symmetry-energy stiffness, and also for the SLy4 functional. We also solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations to calculate the distribution of mass within the inner crust. Qualitatively similar results are found for all four functionals, and in particular the number of protons per Wigner-Seitz cell is in all cases equal to 40 throughout the inner crust. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

Mares;  In-medium ${\bar K}N$ scattering amplitudes developed within a new chirally motivated coupled-channel model due to Cieply and Smejkal that fits the recent SIDDHARTA kaonic hydrogen 1s level shift and width are used to construct $K^-$ nuclear potentials for calculations of $K^-$ nuclear quasi-bound states. The strong energy and density dependence of scattering amplitudes at and near threshold leads to $K^-$ potential depths $-Re V_K \approx 80 -120$ MeV. Self-consistent calculations of all $K^-$ nuclear quasi-bound states, including excited states, are reported. Model dependence, polarization effects, the role of p-wave interactions, and two-nucleon $K^-NN\rightarrow YN$ absorption modes are discussed. The $K^-$ absorption widths $\Gamma_K$ are comparable or even larger than the corresponding binding energies $B_K$ for all $K^-$ nuclear quasi-bound states, exceeding considerably the level spacing. This discourages search for $K^-$ nuclear quasi-bound states in any but lightest nuclear systems. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.0234;Effective interactions and operators in no-core shell model; I. Stetcu,  J. Rotureau;"  Solutions to the nuclear many-body problem rely on effective interactions, and in general effective operators, to take into account effects not included in calculations. These include effects due to the truncation to finite model spaces where a numerical calculation is tractable, as well as physical terms not included in the description in the first place. In the no-core shell model (NCSM) framework, we discuss two approaches to the effective interactions based on (i) unitary transformations and (ii) effective field theory (EFT) principles. Starting from a given Hamiltonian, the unitary transformation approach is designed to take into account effects induced by the truncation to finite model spaces in which a numerical calculation is performed. This approach was widely applied to the description of nuclear properties of light nuclei; we review the theory and present representative results. In the EFT approach, a Hamiltonian is always constructed in a truncated model space according to the symmetries of the underlying theory, making use of power counting to limit the number of interactions included in the calculations. Hence, physical terms not explicitly included in the calculation are treated on the same footing with the truncation to a finite model space. In this approach, we review results for both nuclear and trapped atomic systems, for which the effective theories are formally similar, albeit describing different underlying physics. Finally, the application of the EFT method of constructing effective interactions to Gamow shell model is briefly discussed. ";Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

They will probe inverted hierarchy region of the neutrino mass pattern. There is also a revived interest to the resonant neutrinoless double-electron capture, which has also a potential to probe lepton number conservation and to investigate the neutrino nature and mass scale. The primary concern are the nuclear matrix elements. Clearly, the accuracy of the determination of the effective Majorana neutrino mass from the measured 0\nu\beta\beta-decay half-life is mainly determined by our knowledge of the nuclear matrix elements. We review recent progress achieved in the calculation of 0\nu\beta\beta and 0\nu ECEC nuclear matrix elements within the quasiparticle random phase approximation. A considered self-consistent approach allow to derive the pairing, residual interactions and the two-nucleon short-range correlations from the same modern realistic nucleon-nucleon potentials. The effect of nuclear deformation is taken into account. A possibility to evaluate 0\nu\beta\beta-decay matrix elements phenomenologically is discussed. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.0491;Relation of isospin-symmetry breaking correction for superallowed beta  decay to energy of charge-exchange giant monopole resonance; Vadim Rodin;  After application of an analytical transformation, a new exact representation for the nuclear isospin-symmetry breaking correction $\delta_C$ to superallowed beta decay is obtained. The correction is shown to be essentially the reciprocal of the square of an energy parameter $\Omega_M$ which characterizes the charge-exchange monopole strength distribution. The proportionality coefficient in this relation is determined by basic properties of the ground state of the even-even parent nucleus, and should be reliably calculable in any realistic nuclear model. Therefore, the single parameter $\Omega_M$ contains all the information about the properties of excited $0^+$ states needed to describe $\delta_C$. This parameter can possibly be determined experimentally by charge-exchange reactions. Basic quantities of interest are calculated within the isospin-consistent continuum random phase approximation, and the values of $\delta_C$ are compared with the corresponding results from other approaches. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

The modification is made so as to reproduce microscopic results of neutron-matter energies, in addition to the measured binding energies of doubly magic nuclei including $^{100}$Sn and the even-odd mass differences of the Z=50 and N=82 nuclei in the self-consistent mean-field calculations. Separation energies of the proton- or neutron-magic nuclei are shown to be in fair agreement with the experimental data. With the new parameter-sets M3Y-P6 and P7, the isotropic spin-saturated symmetric nuclear matter remains stable in the density range as wide as $\rho\lesssim 6\rho_0$, while keeping desirable results of the previous parameter-set on finite nuclei.

The analysis was done for the case of an exclusive experimental setup where the produced electron and pion are detected in coincidence. The explicit dependence of all polarization observables on two, from five, kinematic variables (the azimuthal angle $\varphi$ and the virtual-photon parameter $\epsilon$), have been obtained assuming one-photon-exchange. The application to the particular case of a mechanism which contains information on time-like proton form factors in the unphysical region is considered in the Born approximation. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)"

Esbensen;  Structures observed in heavy-ion fusion cross sections at energies above the Coulomb barrier are interpreted as caused by the penetration of centrifugal barriers that are well-separated in energy. The structures are most pronounced in the fusion of lighter, symmetric systems, where the separation in energy between successive angular momentum barriers is relatively large. It is shown that the structures or peaks can be revealed by plotting the first derivative of the energy weighted cross section. It is also shown how an orbital angular momentum can be assign to the observed peaks by comparing to coupled-channels calculations. This is illustrated by analyzing high-energy fusion data for $^{12}$C+$^{16}$O and $^{16}$O+$^{16}$O, and the possibility of observing similar structures in the fusion of heavier systems is discussed. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

We define and calculate interaction length scales which we call the causal range and the Cauchy-Schwarz range for all spin channels up to J = 3. For some channels we find that these length scales are as large as 5 fm.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.1523;More is different: 50 years of nuclear BCS; R. A. Broglia;  Many of the concepts which are at the basis of the development associated with a quantitative treatment of the variety of phenomena associated with the spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetry in nuclei have been instrumental in connection with novel studies of soft matter, namely of protein evolution and protein folding. Although the route to these subjects and associated development does not necessarily imply the nuclear physics connection, such a connection has proven qualitatively and quantitatively inspiring. In particular to model protein evolution in terms of the alignment of quasispins displaying twenty different projections, one for each of the twenty amino acids occurring in nature, and the associated symmetry breaking in information (sequence) space. Emergent properties of the corresponding phase transition are domain walls which stabilize local elementary structures (LES), few groups of 10-20 aminoacids which become structured already in the denatured state provide the molecular recognition directing protein folding. In fact, their docking is closely related to the transition state of the process. While the two-step, yes or no, folding process, does not provide direct information concerning LES, one can force LES from virtual to become real, observable final state entities. Getting again inspiration from the nuclear case (virtual processes contributing to pair correlations can be forced to become real with the help of a probe which itself changes particle number by two), one would expect that to make real virtual LES, that is segments of the protein which already at an early stage of the folding process flicker in and out of their native conformation, one needs a probe which itself displays a similar behaviour. Peptides displaying a sequence identical to LES are such probes. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph)"

The second consists in the choice of equations of motion for the dissipative currents. Israel and Stewart used the second moment of the Boltzmann equation, but this is not the only possible choice. In fact, there are infinitely many moments of the Boltzmann equation which can serve as equations of motion for the dissipative currents. All resulting equations of motion have the same form, but the transport coefficients are different in each case. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)"

In order to arrive at the goal, the idea of the quasiparticles is brought up in the conservation of the fermion number. Under the c-number replacement for the three su(2)-generators, the quasiparticles suggested in this paper are reduced to those in the BCS-Bogoliubov approach.

This response is characterized with a set of non-linear response coefficients that determine, for example, the $v_5$ that is produced by an $\epsilon_2$ and an $\epsilon_3$. We analyze how viscosity damps both the linear and non-linear response coefficients, and provide an analytical estimate that qualitatively explains most of the trends observed in more complete simulations. Subsequently, we use these nonlinear response coefficients to determine the linear and non-linear contributions to $v_1$, $v_4$ and $v_5$. For viscous hydrodynamics the nonlinear contribution is dominant for $v_4$, $v_5$ and higher harmonics. For $v_1$, the nonlinear response constitutes an important $\sim 25%$ correction in mid-central collisions. The nonlinear response is also analyzed as a function of transverse momentum for $v_1$, $v_4$ and $v_5$. Finally, recent measurements of correlations between event-planes of different harmonic orders are discussed in the context of non-linear response. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"

For the first-order equation, we explicitly obtain the distribution function in the asymptotic regime as the invariant manifold of the dynamical system, which turns out to be nothing but the matching condition defining the energy frame, i.e., the Landau-Lifshitz one. It is argued that the frame on which the flow of the relativistic hydrodynamic equation is defined must be the energy frame, if the dynamics should be consistent with the underlying RBE. A sketch is also given for derivation of the second-order hydrodynamic equation, i.e., extended thermodynamics, which is accomplished by extending the invariant manifold so that it is spanned by excited modes as well as the zero modes (hydrodynamic modes) of the linearized collision operator. On the basis of thus constructed resummed distribution function, we propose a novel ansatz for the functional form to be used in Grad moment method; it is shown that our theory gives the same expressions for the transport coefficients as those given in the Chapman-Enskog theory as well as the novel expressions for the relaxation times and lengths allowing natural interpretation.

We calculate the excited states in $^{28}$Si using the multi-configuration mixing method based on the $^{16}$O + 3$\alpha$ cluster model. We also include the $^{16}$O + $^{12}$C and $^{24}$Mg + $\alpha$ basis wave functions prepared by the generator coordinate method. To identify the gas-like states, we calculate the isoscalar monopole transition strengths and the overlap of the obtained states with the geometrical cluster wave function and the Tohsaki-Horiuchi-Schuck-R\""{o}pke (THSR) wave function. The results show that the obtained fourth and twelfth states significantly overlap with the THSR wave function. These two states clearly coexist with the $^{16}$O + $^{12}$C cluster states, emerging at similar energies. The calculated isoscalar monopole strengths between those two states are significantly large, indicating that the states are members of the excitation mode. Furthermore, the calculated root-mean-squared (RMS) radii for these states also suggest that a layer of gas-like three $\alpha$ particles could exist around the surface of the $^{16}$O core, which can be described as a ""two-dimensional gas"" in the intermediate state before the Hoyle-like three $\alpha$ states emerge.

For the superfluid subsystem, the difference D_2 is approximately equal to 2\Delta, the gap \Delta being the solution of the gap equation. For the non-superfluid subsystem, D_2 is found by solving the equation for two-particle Green function for normal systems. Both equations under consideration contain the same effective pairing interaction.

Zhang;  With the quantum diffusion approach the behavior of the capture cross-section is investigated in the reactions $^{92,94}$Mo + $^{92,94}$Mo, $^{100}$Ru + $^{100}$Ru, $^{104}$Pd + $^{104}$Pd, and $^{78}$Kr + $^{112}$Sn at deep sub-barrier energies which are lower than the ground state energies of the compound nuclei. Because the capture cross section is the sum of the complete fusion and quasifission cross sections, and the complete fusion cross section is zero at these sub-barrier energies, one can study experimentally the unique quasifission process in these reactions after the capture. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3155;Different Methods for the Two-Nucleon T-Matrix in the Operator Form; J. Golak,  R. Skibinski,  H. Witala,  K. Topolnicki,  W. Gloeckle,  A. Nogga,  H. Kamada;  We compare three methods to calculate the nucleon-nucleon t-matrix based on the three-dimensional formulation of J. Golak et al., Phys. Rev. C 81, 034006, (2010). In the first place we solve a system of complex linear inhomogeneous equations directly for the t-matrix. Our second method is based on iterations and a variant of the Lanczos algorithm. In the third case we obtain the t-matrix in two steps, solving a system of real linear equations for the k-matrix expansion coefficients and then solving an on-shell equation, which connects the scalar coefficients of the k- and t-matrices. A very good agreement among the three methods is demonstrated for selected nucleon-nucleon scattering observables using a chiral next-to-next-to-leading-order neutron-proton potential. We also apply our three-dimensional framework to the demanding problem of proton-proton scattering, using a corresponding version of the nucleon-nucleon potential and supplementing it with the (screened) Coulomb force, taken also in the three-dimensional form. We show converged results for two different screening functions and find a very good agreement with other methods dealing with proton-proton scattering. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

Nogga;  Recently a formalism for a direct treatment of the Faddeev equation for the three-nucleon bound state in three dimensions has been proposed. It relies on an operator representation of the Faddeev component in the momentum space and leads to a finite set of coupled equations for scalar functions which depend only on three variables. In this paper we provide further elements of this formalism and show the first numerical results for chiral NNLO nuclear forces. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3361;Damping of giant dipole resonance in hot rotating nuclei; Nguyen Dinh Dang;  The phonon damping model (PDM) is extended to include the effect of angular momentum at finite temperature. The model is applied to the study of damping of giant dipole resonance (GDR) in hot and noncollectively rotating spherical nuclei. The numerical results obtained for Mo88 and Sn106 show that the GDR width increases with both temperature T and angular momentum M. At T > 4 MeV and M<= 60 hbar the increase in the GDR width slows down for Sn106, whereas at M<= 80 hbar the GDR widths in both nuclei nearly saturate. By adopting the nuclear shear viscosity extracted from fission data at T= 0, it is shown that the maximal value of the angular momentum for Mo88 and Sn106 should be around 46 and 55 hbar, respectively, so that the universal conjecture for the lower bound of the specific shear viscosity for all fluids is not violated up to T= 5 MeV. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3371;Particlization in hybrid models; Pasi Huovinen,  Hannah Petersen;  In hybrid models, which combine hydrodynamical and transport approaches to describe different stages of heavy-ion collisions, conversion of fluid to individual particles, particlization, is a non-trivial technical problem. We describe in detail how to find the particlization hypersurface in a 3+1 dimensional model, and how to sample the particle distributions evaluated using the Cooper-Frye procedure to create an ensemble of particles as an initial state for the transport stage. We also discuss the role and magnitude of the negative contributions in the Cooper-Frye procedure. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3374;Results of Nucleon Resonance Extraction via Dynamical Coupled-Channels  Analysis from Collaboration@EBAC; Hiroyuki Kamano;  We review a global analysis of meson production reactions off the nucleons by a collaboration at Excited Baryon Analysis Center of Jefferson Lab. The analysis is pursued with a dynamical coupled-channels approach, within which the dynamics of multi-channel reaction processes are taken into account in a fully consistent way with the two-body as well as three-body unitarity of the S-matrix. With this approach, new features of nucleon excitations are revealed as resonant particles originating from the non-trivial multi-channel reaction dynamics, which cannot be addressed by static hadron models where the nucleon excitations are treated as stable particles. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3379;Symmetry energy of deformed neutron-rich nuclei; M. K. Gaidarov,  A. N. Antonov,  P. Sarriguren,  E. Moya de Guerra;  The symmetry energy, the neutron pressure and the asymmetric compressibility of deformed neutron-rich even-even nuclei are calculated on the examples of Kr and Sm isotopes within the coherent density fluctuation model using the symmetry energy as a function of density within the Brueckner energy-density functional. The correlation between the thickness of the neutron skin and the characteristics related with the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy is investigated for isotopic chains of these nuclei in the framework of the self-consistent Skyrme-Hartree-Fock plus BCS method. Results for an extended chain of Pb isotopes are also presented. A remarkable difference is found in the trend followed by the different isotopic chains: the studied correlations reveal a smoother behavior in the Pb case than in the other cases. We also notice that the neutron skin thickness obtained for $^{208}$Pb with SLy4 force is found to be in a good agreement with recent data. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)

Kamada;  We compare results from the traditional partial wave treatment of deuteron electro-disintegration with a new approach that uses three dimensional formalism. The new framework for the two-nucleon (2N) system using a complete set of isospin - spin states made it possible to construct simple implementations that employ a very general operator form of the current operator and 2N states. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3407;BCS-BEC crossover in nuclear matter with the relativistic  Hartree-Bogoliubov theory; Ting Ting Sun,  Bao Yuan Sun,  Jie Meng;  Based on the relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory, the influence of the pairing interaction strength on the di-neutron correlations and the crossover from superfluidity of neutron Cooper pairs in the $^{1}S_{0}$ channel to Bose-Einstein condensation of di-neutron pairs is systematically investigated in the nuclear matter. The bare nucleon-nucleon interaction Bonn-B is taken in the particle-particle channel with an effective factor to simulate the medium effects and take into account the possible ambiguity of pairing force, and the effective interaction PK1 is used in the particle-hole channel. If the effective factor is larger than 1.10, a di-neutron BEC state appears in the low-density limit, and if it is smaller than 0.85, the neutron Cooper pairs are found totally in the weak coupling BCS region. The reference values of several characteristic quantities which characterize the BCS-BEC crossover are obtained respectively from the dimensionless parameter $1/(k_{\rm Fn}a)$ with $a$ the scattering length and $k_{\rm{Fn}}$ the neutron Fermi momentum, the zero-momentum transfer density correlation function D(0) and the effective chemical potential $\nu_{\rm n}$. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3481;Multipair approach to pairing in nuclei; M. Sambataro;  The ground state of a general pairing Hamiltonian for a finite nuclear system is constructed as a product of collective, real, distinct pairs. These are determined sequentially via an iterative variational procedure that resorts to diagonalizations of the Hamiltonian in restricted model spaces. Different applications of the method are provided that include comparisons with exact and projected BCS results. The quantities that are examined are correlation energies, occupation numbers and pair transfer matrix elements. In a first application within the picket-fence model, the method is seen to generate the exact ground state for pairing strengths confined in a given range. Further applications of the method concern pairing in spherically symmetric mean fields and include simple exactly solvable models as well as some realistic calculations for middle-shell Sn isotopes. In the latter applications, two different ways of defining the pairs are examined: either with J=0 or with no well-defined angular momentum. The second choice reveals to be more effective leading, under some circumstances, to solutions that are basically exact. ;Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3508;Nuclear Binding Energies and NN uncertainties; R. Navarro Perez,  J. E. Amaro,  E. Ruiz Arriola;  There is an increasing interest in quantifying the predictive power in nuclear structure calculations. We discuss how both experimental and systematic errors at the NN-level can be used to estimate the theoretical uncertainties by rather simple means and without solving the full nuclear many body problem. We emphasize the role of effective interactions defined by coarse graining the NN potential to length scales of the order of the minimal de Broglie wavelength probed between nucleons in nuclei. We find an a priori error of \DeltaB/A \sim 0.1 - 0.4MeV for the binding energy per particle throughout the periodic table for 2 \leq A \leq 208, and a linear growth of the error with density for nuclear matter \DeltaB/A \sim 3.75{\rho}n.m. and neutron matter \DeltaB/N \sim 3.5{\rho}n.. This suggests to limit the computational effort in solving the Nuclear Many Body Problem to such an accuracy. ;"Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3648;Collective modes of the order parameter in a triplet superfluid neutron  liquid; L. B. Leinson;"  The complete spectrum of collective modes of the triplet order parameter in the superfluid neutron matter is examined in the BCS approximation below the pair-breaking threshold. The dispersion equations both for the unitary and nonunitary excitations are derived and solved in the limit of $q\rightarrow0$ by taking into account the anisotropy of the energy gap for the case of $P$-wave pairing. By our analysis, there is only one Goldstone mode which is associated with the broken gauge symmetry. We found no additional Goldstone modes associated with the broken rotational symmetry but found that the oscillations of the total angular momentum are qualitatively similar to the ""normal-flapping"" mode in the A-phase of superfluid Helium. There are also two collective modes associated with internal vibrations of the structure of the order parameter oscillating with $\omega(T=0) =1.20\Delta_{0}$ and $\omega(T=0) =0.61\Delta_{0}$.
