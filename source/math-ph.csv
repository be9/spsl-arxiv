https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.0280;Generating Functionals and Lagrangian PDEs; Joris Vankerschaver,  Cuicui Liao,  Melvin Leok;  We introduce the concept of Type-I/II generating functionals defined on the space of boundary data of a Lagrangian field theory. On the Lagrangian side, we define an analogue of Jacobi's solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for field theories, and we show that by taking variational derivatives of this functional, we obtain an isotropic submanifold of the space of Cauchy data, described by the so-called multisymplectic form formula. We also define a Hamiltonian analogue of Jacobi's solution, and we show that this functional is a Type-II generating functional. We finish the paper by defining a similar framework of generating functions for discrete field theories, and we show that for the linear wave equation, we recover the multisymplectic conservation law of Bridges. ;Mathematical Physics (math-ph)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.0490;Data Set Models and Exponential Families in Statistical Physics and  Beyond; Jan Naudts,  Ben Anthonis;  The exponential family of models is defined in a general setting, not relying on probability theory. Some results of information geometry are shown to remain valid. Exponential families both of classical and of quantum mechanical statistical physics fit into the new formalism. Other less obvious applications are predicted. For instance, quantum states can be modeled as points in a classical phase space and the resulting model belongs to the exponential family. ;Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.0598;Exact solutions for the 2d one component plasma; Timothy D. Andersen;  The 2d one component gas of pointlike charges in a uniform neutralizing background interacting with a logarithmic potential is a common model for plasmas. In its classical equilibrium statistics at fixed temperature (canonical ensemble) it is formally related to certain types of random matrices with Gaussian distribution and complex eigenvalues. In this paper, I present an exact integration of this ensemble for $N$ such particles (or alternatively $N\times N$ matrices) for all even non-negative temperatures, a significant open problem in statistical physics for several decades. I achieve this exact integration via an exact integration of a related ensemble, the two-dimensional Selberg integral. ;Mathematical Physics (math-ph)

Texier;"  A derivation of the spectral determinant of the Schr\""odinger operator on a metric graph is presented where the local matching conditions at the vertices are of the general form classified according to the scheme of Kostrykin and Schrader. To formulate the spectral determinant we first derive the spectral zeta function of the Schr\""odinger operator using an appropriate secular equation.

Andersen;  The one dimensional one component plasma has applications to one dimensional particle systems with logarithmic interactions such as charges in a single channel wire or vortex filaments in a fluid convection stream. The exact integral of this plasma in the canonical ensemble with a gaussian confining potential has already been computed. In this paper, I compute the exact volume of the phase space of the plasma of N particles at fixed energy without a confining potential using a microcanonical ensemble and show that, as in the two-dimensional case, it has negative temperature states, suggesting that one dimensional turbulence can occur from vortex/electron clustering. ;Mathematical Physics (math-ph)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.0751;Continuous Limits of Classical Repeated Interaction Systems; Julien Deschamps;"  We consider the physical model of a classical mechanical system (called ""small system"") undergoing repeated interactions with a chain of identical small pieces (called ""environment""). This physical setup constitutes an advantageous way of implementing dissipation for classical systems, it is at the same time Hamiltonian and Markovian. This kind of model has already been studied in the context of quantum mechanical systems, where it was shown to give rise to quantum Langevin equations in the limit of continuous time interactions ([2]), but it has never been considered for classical mechanical systems yet. The aim of this article is to compute the continuous limit of repeated interactions for classical systems and to prove that they give rise to particular stochastic differential equations in the limit. In particular we recover the usual Langevin equations associated to the action of heat baths. In order to obtain these results, we consider the discrete-time dynamical system induced by Hamilton's equations and the repeated interactions. We embed it into a continuous-time dynamical system and we compute the limit when the time step goes to 0. This way we obtain a discrete-time approximation of stochastic differential equation, considered as a deterministic dynamical system on the Wiener space, which is not exactly of the usual Euler scheme type. We prove the Lp and almost sure convergence of this scheme. We end up with applications to concrete physical exemples such as a charged particule in an uniform electric field or a harmonic interaction. We obtain the usual Langevin equation for the action of a heat bath when considering a damped harmonic oscillator as the small system. ";"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Probability (math.PR)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.0757;Angular momentum decomposition of the three-dimensional Wigner harmonic  oscillator; Gilles Regniers,  Joris Van der Jeugt;  In the Wigner framework, one abandons the assumption that the usual canonical commutation relations are necessarily valid. Instead, the compatibility of Hamilton's equations and the Heisenberg equations are the starting point, and no further assumptions are made about how the position and momentum operators commute. Wigner quantization leads to new classes of solutions, and representations of Lie superalgebras are needed to describe them. For the n-dimensional Wigner harmonic oscillator, solutions are known in terms of the Lie superalgebras osp(1|2n) and gl(1|n). For n=3N, the question arises as to how the angular momentum decomposition of representations of these Lie superalgebras is computed. We construct generating functions for the angular momentum decomposition of specific series of representations of osp(1|6N) and gl(1|3N), with N=1 and N=2. This problem can be completely solved for N=1. However, for N=2 only some classes of representations allow executable computations ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.0777;Generalised Elliptic Functions; Matthew England,  Chris Athorne;  We consider multiply periodic functions, sometimes called Abelian functions, defined with respect to the period matrices associated with classes of algebraic curves. We realise them as generalisations of the Weierstras P-function using two different approaches. These functions arise naturally as solutions to some of the important equations of mathematical physics and their differential equations, addition formulae, and applications have all been recent topics of study. The first approach discussed sees the functions defined as logarithmic derivatives of the sigma-function, a modified Riemann theta-function. We can make use of known properties of the sigma function to derive power series expansions and in turn the properties mentioned above. This approach has been extended to a wide range of non hyperelliptic and higher genus curves and an overview of recent results is given. The second approach defines the functions algebraically, after first modifying the curve into its equivariant form. This approach allows the use of representation theory to derive a range of results at lower computational cost. We discuss the development of this theory for hyperelliptic curves and how it may be extended in the future. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Representation Theory (math.RT)"

Meissner,  Marcin Napiórkowski;  We consider translation invariant quantum systems in thermodynamic limit. We argue that their energy-momentum spectra should have shapes consistent with effective models involving quasiparticles. Our main example is second quantized homogeneous interacting Fermi gas in a large cubic box with periodic boundary conditions, at zero temperature. We expect that its energy-momentum spectrum has a positive energy gap and a positive critical velocity. ;Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.0827;A Study about the Supersymmetry in the context of Quantum Mechanics; Fabricio Marques;  In this work we present an introduction to Supersymmetry in the context of 1-dimensional Quantum Mechanics. For that purpose we develop the concept of hamiltonians factorization using the simple harmonic oscillator as an example, we introduce the supersymmetric oscilator and, next, we generalize these concepts to introduce the fundamentals of Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics. We also discuss useful tools to solve problems in Quantum Mechanics which are intrinsecally related to Supersymmetry as hierarchy of hamiltonians and shape invariance. We present two approximation methods which will be specially useful: the well known Variational Method and the Logarithmic Perturbation Theory, the latter being closely related to the concepts of superpotentials and hierarchy of hamiltonians. Finally, we present problems related to superpotentials which are monomials in even powers of the x coordinate multiplied by the sign function epsilon(x), which seems to be a new class of problems in Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics. ;Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.0861;Invariant-based approach to symmetry class detection; Nicolas Auffray (MSME),  Boris Kolev (LATP),  Michel Petitot (LIFL);  In this paper, the problem of the identification of the symmetry class of a given tensor is asked. Contrary to classical approaches which are based on the spectral properties of the linear operator describing the elasticity, our setting is based on the invariants of the irreducible tensors appearing in the harmonic decomposition of the elasticity tensor [Forte-Vianello, 1996]. To that aim we first introduce a geometrical description of the space of elasticity tensors. This framework is used to derive invariant-based conditions that characterize symmetry classes. For low order symmetry classes, such conditions are given on a triplet of quadratic forms extracted from the harmonic decomposition of the elasticity tensor $C$, meanwhile for higher-order classes conditions are provided in terms of elements of $H^{4}$, the higher irreducible space in the decomposition of $C$. Proceeding in such a way some well known conditions appearing in the Mehrabadi-Cowin theorem for the existence of a symmetry plane are retrieved, and a set of algebraic relations on polynomial invariants characterizing the orthotropic, trigonal, tetragonal, transverse isotropic and cubic symmetry classes are provided. Using a genericity assumption on the elasticity tensor under study, an algorithm to identify the symmetry class of a large set of tensors is finally provided. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Classical Physics (physics.class-ph)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.1050;Unified derivation of exact solutions for a class of quasi-exactly  solvable models; Davids Agboola,  Yao-Zhong Zhang;  We present a unified treatment of exact solutions for a class of four quantum mechanical models, namely the singular anharmonic potential, the generalized quantum isotonic oscillator, the soft-core Coulomb potential, and the non-polynomially modified oscillator. We show that all four cases are reducible to the same basic ordinary differential equation, which is quasi-exactly solvable. A systematic and closed form solution to the basic equation is obtained via the Bethe ansatz method. Using the result, general exact expressions for the energies and the allowed potential parameters are given explicitly for each of the four cases in terms of the roots of a set of algebraic equations. A hidden $sl(2)$ algebraic structure is also discovered in these models. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.1159;Geometric spectral inversion for singular potentials; Richard L. Hall,  Wolfgang Lucha;  The function E = F(v) expresses the dependence of a discrete eigenvalue E of the Schroedinger Hamiltonian H = -\Delta + vf(r) on the coupling parameter v. We use envelope theory to generate a functional sequence \{f^{[k]}(r)\} to reconstruct f(r) from F(v) starting from a seed potential f^{[0]}(r). In the power-law or log cases the inversion can be effected analytically and is complete in just two steps. In other cases convergence is observed numerically. To provide concrete illustrations of the inversion method it is first applied to the Hulth\'en potential, and it is then used to invert spectral data generated by singular potentials with shapes of the form f(r) = -a/r + b\sgn(q)r^q and f(r) = -a/r + b\ln(r), a, b > 0. For the class of attractive central potentials with shapes f(r) = g(r)/r, with g(0)< 0 and g'(r)\ge 0, we prove that the ground-state energy curve F(v) determines f(r) uniquely. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

We show that the equations with constant forcing have a bounded absorbing ball in the $H^1$-norm and that a solution to the unforced equations has its $H^1$-norm decay to 0. From this, we argue that there exists an invariant measure (on $H^1$) for the equations under random kick-forcing. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Dynamical Systems (math.DS)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.1265;Saturated-Unsaturated flow in a Compressible Leaky-unconfined Aquifer; Phoolendra K. Mishra,  Velimir V. Vessilinov,  Kristopher L. Kuhlman;  An analytical solution is developed for three-dimensional flow towards a partially penetrating large-diameter well in an unconfined aquifer bounded below by an aquitard of finite or semi-infinite extent. The analytical solution is derived using Laplace and Hankel transforms, then inverted numerically. Existing solutions for flow in leaky unconfined aquifers neglect the unsaturated zone following an assumption of instantaneous drainage assumption due to Neuman [1972]. We extend the theory of leakage in unconfined aquifers by (1) including water flow and storage in the unsaturated zone above the water table, and (2) allowing the finite-diameter pumping well to partially penetrate the aquifer. The investigation of model-predicted results shows that leakage from an underlying aquitard leads to significant departure from the unconfined solution without leakage. The investigation of dimensionless time-drawdown relationships shows that the aquitard drawdown also depends on unsaturated zone properties and the pumping-well wellbore storage effects. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.1350;Spectral density asymptotics for Gaussian and Laguerre $β$-ensembles  in the exponentially small region; Peter J. Forrester;  The first two terms in the large $N$ asymptotic expansion of the $\beta$ moment of the characteristic polynomial for the Gaussian and Laguerre $\beta$-ensembles are calculated. This is used to compute the asymptotic expansion of the spectral density in these ensembles, in the exponentially small region outside the leading support, up to terms $o(1)$ . The leading form of the right tail of the distribution of the largest eigenvalue is given by the density in this regime. It is demonstrated that there is a scaling from this, to the right tail asymptotics for the distribution of the largest eigenvalue at the soft edge. ;Mathematical Physics (math-ph)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.1460;Curved String Topology and Tangential Fukaya Categories; Daniel Pomerleano;  Given a simply connected manifold M such that its cochain algebra, C^\star(M), is a pure Sullivan dga, this paper considers curved deformations of the algebra C_\star({\Omega}M) and consider when the category of curved modules over these algebras becomes fully dualizable. For simple manifolds, like products of spheres, we are able to give an explicit criterion for when the resulting category of curved modules is smooth, proper and CY and thus gives rise to a TQFT. We give Floer theoretic interpretations of these theories for projective spaces and their products, which involve defining a Fukaya category which counts holomorphic disks with prescribed tangencies to a divisor. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Category Theory (math.CT)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.1463;Determinant and Weyl anomaly of Dirac operator: a holographic derivation; Rodrigo Aros,  Danilo E Diaz;"  We present a holographic formula relating functional determinants: the fermion determinant in the one-loop effective action of bulk spinors in an asymptotically locally AdS background, and the determinant of the two-point function of the dual operator at the conformal boundary. The formula originates from AdS/CFT heuristics that map a quantum contribution in the bulk partition function to a subleading large-N contribution in the boundary partition function. We use this holographic picture to address questions in spectral theory and conformal geometry. As an instance, we compute the type-A Weyl anomaly and the determinant of the iterated Dirac operator on round spheres, express the latter in terms of Barnes' multiple gamma function and gain insight into a conjecture by B\""ar and Schopka.

We use these estimates to improve on the description of finite volume eigenvalues and eigenfunctions obtained in a previous paper. As a consequence of the improved description of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, we revisit a number of results on the spectral statistics in the localized regime and extend their domain of validity, namely : - the local spectral statistics for the unfolded eigenvalues; - the local asymptotic ergodicity of the unfolded eigenvalues; In dimension 1, for the standard Anderson model, the improvement enables us to obtain the local spectral statistics at band edge, that is in the Lifshitz tail regime. In higher dimensions, this works for modified Anderson models. ";Mathematical Physics (math-ph)

This paradox suggests that for a consistent description of spinning particles something more general than a worldline concept should be used.

Through the restriction to the subnet, we construct a new family of Longo-Witten endomorphisms on the U(1)-current net and accordingly interacting wedge-local nets in two-dimensional spacetime. The U(1)-current net admits the structure of particle numbers and the S-matrices of the models constructed here do mix the spaces with different particle numbers of the bosonic Fock space. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Operator Algebras (math.OA)"

In particular two seemingly contradictory approaches are compared: (i) a complex WKB formalism, for which the centres of coherent states naturally evolve along complex trajectories, which leads to a class of complexified coherent states; (ii) the investigation of the dynamical equations for the real expectation values of position and momentum, for which an Ehrenfest theorem has been derived in a previous paper, yielding real but non-Hamiltonian classical dynamics on phase space for the real centres of coherent states. Both approaches become exact for quadratic Hamiltonians. The apparent contradiction is resolved building on an observation by Huber, Heller and Littlejohn, that complexified coherent states are equivalent if their centres lie on a specific complex Lagrangian manifold. A rich underlying complex symplectic geometry is unravelled. In particular a natural complex structure is identified that defines a projection from complex to real phase space, mapping complexified coherent states to their real equivalents.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.2010;The Spectral Zeta Function for Laplace Operators on Warped Product  Manifolds of the type $I\times_{f} N$; Guglielmo Fucci,  Klaus Kirsten;  In this work we study the spectral zeta function associated with the Laplace operator acting on scalar functions defined on a warped product of manifolds of the type $I\times_{f} N$ where $I$ is an interval of the real line and $N$ is a compact, $d$-dimensional Riemannian manifold either with or without boundary. Starting from an integral representation of the spectral zeta function, we find its analytic continuation by exploiting the WKB asymptotic expansion of the eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator on $M$ for which a detailed analysis is presented. We apply the obtained results to the explicit computation of the zeta regularized functional determinant and the coefficients of the heat kernel asymptotic expansion. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)"

We discuss, for G=SU(n), the field-theoretic and algebraic aspects of this phenomenon and show that these renormalization factors are compatible with the natural definitions of quantum determinants possessing the factorization property (i.e., the determinant of a product is equal to the product of determinants, which is a non-trivial fact for matrices with non-commuting entries). ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Quantum Algebra (math.QA)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.2162;A critical phenomenon in the two-matrix model in the quartic/quadratic  case; Maurice Duits,  Dries Geudens;  We study a critical behavior for the eigenvalue statistics in the two-matrix model in the quartic/quadratic case. For certain parameters, the eigenvalue distribution for one of the matrices has a limit that vanishes with an exponent 1/2 in the interior of the support. The main result of the paper is a new kernel that describes the local eigenvalue correlations near that critical point. The kernel is expressed in terms of a 4 x 4 Riemann-Hilbert problem related to the Hastings-McLeod solution of the Painlev\'e II equation. We then compare the new kernel with two other critical phenomena that appeared in the literature before. First, we show that the critical kernel that appears in case of quadratic vanishing of the limiting eigenvalue distribution can be retrieved from the new kernel by means of a double scaling limit. Second, we briefly discuss the relation with the tacnode singularity in non-colliding Brownian motions that was recently analyzed. Although the limiting density in that model also vanishes with an exponent 1/2 at a certain interior point, the process at the local scale is different from the process that we obtain in the two-matrix model. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Complex Variables (math.CV); Probability (math.PR)"

A given quantum walk does not generally admit a continuous limit but some families (1-jets) of quantum walks do. All families (1-jets) admitting a continuous limit are identified.

Kalliadasis;  Consider the generalized Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (gKS) equation. It is a model prototype for a wide variety of physical systems, from flame-front propagation, and more general front propagation in reaction-diffusion systems, to interface motion of viscous film flows. Our aim is to develop a systematic and rigorous low-dimensional representation of the gKS equation. For this purpose, we approximate it by a renormalization group (RG) equation which is qualitatively characterized by rigorous error bounds. This formulation allows for a new stochastic mode reduction guaranteeing optimality in the sense of maximal information entropy. Herewith, noise is systematically added to the reduced gKS equation and gives a rigorous and analytical explanation for its origin. These new results would allow to reliably perform low-dimensional numerical computations by accounting for the neglected degrees of freedom in a systematic way. Moreover, the presented reduction strategy might also be useful in other applications where classical mode reduction approaches fail or are too complicated to be implemented. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Numerical Analysis (math.NA)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.2277;Lorentz Group and Oriented MICZ-Kepler Orbits; Guowu Meng;  The MICZ-Kepler orbits are the non-colliding orbits of the MICZ Kepler problems (the magnetized versions of the Kepler problem). The oriented MICZ-Kepler orbits can be parametrized by the canonical angular momentum $\mathbf L$ and the Lenz vector $\mathbf A$, with the parameter space consisting of the pairs of 3D vectors $(\mathbf A, \mathbf L)$ with ${\mathbf L}\cdot {\mathbf L} > (\mathbf L\cdot \mathbf A)^2$. The recent 4D perspective of the Kepler problem yields a new parametrization, with the parameter space consisting of the pairs of Minkowski vectors $(a,l)$ with $l\cdot l =-1$, $a\cdot l =0$, $a_0>0$. This new parametrization of orbits implies that the MICZ-Kepler orbits of different magnetic charges are related to each other by symmetries: \emph{${\mathrm {SO}}^+(1,3)\times {\mathbb R}_+$ acts transitively on both the set of oriented elliptic MICZ-Kepler orbits and the set of oriented parabolic MICZ-Kepler orbits}.

Over this model two alternative proofs of Takeuti's correspondence, between self adjoint operators and the real numbers of the model, are given. This approach results to be more constructive showing a direct relation with the Gelfand representation theorem, revealing also the importance of these results with respect to the interpretation of Quantum Mechanics in close connection with the Deutsch-Everett multiversal interpretation. Finally, it is shown how in this context the notion of genericity and the corresponding generic model theorem can help to explain the emergence of classicality also in connection with the Deutsch- Everett perspective. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Logic (math.LO); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.2732;On Poisson geometries related to noncommutative emergent gravity; Nikolaj Kuntner,  Harold Steinacker;  We study metric-compatible Poisson structures in the semi-classical limit of noncommutative emergent gravity. Space-time is realized as quantized symplectic submanifold embedded in R^D, whose effective metric depends on the embedding as well as on the Poisson structure. We study solutions of the equations of motion for the Poisson structure, focusing on a natural class of solutions such that the effective metric coincides with the embedding metric. This leads to i-(anti-) self-dual complexified Poisson structures in four space-time dimensions with Lorentzian signature. Solutions on manifolds with conformally flat metric are obtained and tools are developed which allow to systematically re-derive previous results, e.g. for the Schwarzschild metric. It turns out that the effective gauge coupling is related to the symplectic volume density, and may vary significantly over space-time. To avoid this problem, we consider in a second part space-time manifolds with compactified extra dimensions and split noncommutativity, where solutions with constant gauge coupling are obtained for several physically relevant geometries. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.2871;A numerical approach to harmonic non-commutative spectral field theory; Bernardino Spisso;  The object of this work is the numerical investigation of a non-commutative field theory defined via the spectral action principle. The Starting point is a spectral triple (A,H,D) referred to as harmonic. The construction of these data relies on an 8-dimensional Clifford algebra. The spectral action is computed for the product of the triple (A,H,D) with a matrix-valued spectral triple. Renormalization theory associates to the spectral action a probability measure. Its associated correlation functions define then a field theory. In the perturbative approach this measure is constructed as a formal power series. This requires explicit knowledge of the solutions of the Euler-Lagrange equations. For the model under consideration, it turns out impossible to obtain these solutions. An alternative approach consists in a discretization of all variables and a numerical investigation of the behavior of the correlation functions when the discretization becomes finer. Despite the complexity of the approximated spectral action, some reliable numerical results are obtained, showing that a numerical treatment of this kind of models in the Moyal matrix basis is possible. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.2987;Relation of a New Interpretation of Stochastic Differential Equations to  Ito Process; Jianghong Shi,  Tianqi Chen,  Ruoshi Yuan,  Bo Yuan,  Ping Ao;  Stochastic differential equations (SDE) are widely used in modeling stochastic dynamics in literature. However, SDE alone is not enough to determine a unique process. A specified interpretation for stochastic integration is needed. Different interpretations specify different dynamics. Recently, a new interpretation of SDE is put forward by one of us. This interpretation has a built-in Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution and shows the existence of potential function for general processes, which reveals both local and global dynamics. Despite its powerful property, its relation with classical ones in arbitrary dimension remains obscure. In this paper, we will clarify such connection and derive the concise relation between the new interpretation and Ito process. We point out that the derived relation is experimentally testable. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph)"

For any fixed N we get 2N different superextensions of Maxwell algebra with n-extended Poincare superalgebras (1\leq n \leq N) and the internal symmetry sectors obtained by suitable contractions of the real algebra O_R(2N-k|C)\oplus O(k). Finally the comments on possible applications of Maxwell superalgebras are presented. ";"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.3617;Stationary processes with pure point diffraction; Daniel Lenz,  Robert V. Moody;  We consider the construction and classification of some new mathematical objects, called ergodic spatial stationary processes, on locally compact Abelian groups, which provide a natural and very general setting for studying diffraction and the famous inverse problems associated with it. In particular we can construct complete families of solutions to the inverse problem from any given pure point measure that is chosen to be the diffraction. In this case these processes can be classified by the dual of the group of relators based on the set of Bragg peaks, and this gives a solution to the homometry problem for pure point diffraction. An ergodic spatial stationary process consists of a measure theoretical dynamical system and a mapping linking it with the ambient space in which diffracting density is supposed to exist. After introducing these processes we study their general properties and link pure point diffraction to almost periodicity. Given a pure point measure we show how to construct from it and a given set of phases a corresponding ergodic spatial stationary process. In fact we do this in two separate ways, each of which sheds its own light on the nature of the problem. The first construction can be seen as an elaboration of the Halmos--von Neumann theorem, lifted from the domain of dynamical systems to that of stationary processes. The second is a Gelfand construction obtained by defining a suitable Banach algebra out of the putative eigenfunctions of the desired dynamics. ;Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.3703;Existence of Rosseland equation; QiaoFu Zhang,  JunZhi Cui;"  The global boundness, existence and uniqueness are presented for the kind of Rosseland equation with a small parameter. This problem comes from conduction-radiation coupled heat transfer in the composites; it's with coefficients of high order growth and mixed boundary conditions. A linearized map is constructed by fixing the function variables in the coefficients and the right-hand side. The solution to the linearized problem is uniformly bounded based on De Giorgi iteration; it is bounded in the H\""older space from a Sobolev-Campanato estimate. This linearized map is compact and continuous so that there exists a fixed point. All of these estimates are independent of the small parameter. At the end, the uniqueness of the solution holds if there is a big zero-order term and the solution's gradient is bounded. This existence theorem can be extended to the nonlinear parabolic problem.

Namely, the commutator between the Hamiltonian and the conservation law of a finite chain may result in boundary terms only. No reference to techniques used in Suzuki's proof of Mazur bound is made (which strictly applies only to finite-size systems with exact conservation laws), but Lieb-Robinson bounds and exponential clustering theorems of quasi-local C^* quantum spin algebras are invoked instead. Our result has an important application in the transport theory of quantum spin chains, in particular it provides rigorous non-trivial examples of positive finite-temperature spin Drude weight in the anisotropic Heisenberg XXZ spin 1/2 chain [Phys.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.3898;Wigner-PDC description of photon entanglement as a local-realistic  theory; David Rodriguez;"  Regardless of past proposals (already disproved in experimental work by Brida et al), the Wigner picture of Parametric Down Conversion (works by Casado et al) can be interpreted as a local-realistic formalism, without the need to depart from quantum mechanical predictions at any step, at least for the relevant subset of QED-states. This involves reinterpreting the expressions for the detection probabilities, by means of an additional mathematical manipulation; though such manipulation seemingly provides enough freedom to guarantee consistency with the expectable, experimentally testable behavior of detectors, this is, in any case, irrelevant in relation to our main result, of a purely mathematical nature. Besides, the Wigner-PDC approach opens clear room to explain the elusive nature of a loop-hole free proof of the incompatibility of nature with that local-realism, without the need to assume hypothetical technological inefficiencies yet to overcome after several decades of experimental work. In relation to this, we also address the consequences of this framework in relation to: (i) typical Bell experiments; (ii) perhaps the most relevant recent related test (Phys.Rev.Lett. 108, 2012). Additionally, we also propose an extremely simple interpretation on that apparently awkward ""subtraction"" of the average ZPF intensity at the Wigner image of the detection process.

Semiclassical asymptotics of solutions of the Cauchy problem for the Schr\""{o}dinger equation with initial data concentrated in the neighborhood of one point on the edge, generates a classical dynamical system on a graph. In a situation where all times for packets to pass over edges (""edge travel times"") are linearly independent over the rational numbers, a description of the behavior of such systems is related to the number-theoretic problem of counting the number of lattice points in an expanding polyhedron. In this paper we show that for a finite compact graph packets almost always are distributed evenly. A formula for the leading coefficient of the asymptotic behavior of the number of packets with an increasing time is obtained.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.4092;"Detection probability ""enhancement"" and ""unfair sampling"" in Bell  inequalities"; David Rodríguez;"  On one side, so far a great part of the evidence accepted as proof of the alleged quantum non-locality relied on inhomogeneous Bell inequalities involving an additional assumption (no-enhancement) whose role had not been sufficiently examined (in contrast to homogeneous inequalities, where the role of low detection rates is well acknowledged). A first contribution of this paper is to provide explicit examples of how a model of hidden local variables (LHV) defying no-enhancement is able to produce a violation of an inhomogeneous inequality, a possibility that so far was pointed out only in qualitative terms. On the other hand, recent tests have attempted to overcome this reliance on supplementary assumptions, but still give rise to doubt, due to: (i) violations are extremely low, which points to some systematical error (the fact that alleged random errors of the detectors seem to conspire to interfere exactly at such narrow strip around the frontier with local-realism and not a different part of the spectrum that QM would theoretically produce can hardly be considered just coincidence); (ii) the correspondence between the observations and one or another quantum state is not clear either, as recent models cannot be really validated against the available data (they have equal or more parameters than restrictions). Following (ii), it would be convenient to verify a more significant set of quantum predictions, instead of just the few counting rates involved in a particular Bell inequality. Finally, another type of ""no-go"" tests (an instance of which we examine here) also present subtleties which call for serious examination.

Post;  The main aim of this paper is to introduce a new version of the Fokas-Gel'fand formula for immersion of soliton surfaces in Lie algebras. The paper contains a detailed exposition of the technique for obtaining exact forms of 2D-surfaces associated with any solution of a given nonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODE) which can be written in zero-curvature form. That is, for any generalized symmetry of the zero-curvature condition of the associated integrable model, it is possible to construct soliton surfaces whose Gauss-Mainardi-Codazzi equations are equivalent to infinitesimal deformations of the zero-curvature representation of the considered model. Conversely, it is shown (Proposition 1) that for a given immersion function of a 2D-soliton surface in a Lie algebra, it possible to derive the associated generalized vector field in evolutionary form which characterizes all symmetries of the zero-curvature condition. The theoretical considerations are illustrated via surfaces associated with the Painlev\'e equations P1, P2 and P3, including transcendental functions, the special cases of the rational and Airy solutions of P2 and the classical solutions of P3. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI)"

Introducing a transmutation operator relating the involved bicomplex Vekua equation with the Cauchy-Riemann equation we prove the expansion and the Runge approximation theorems corresponding to the constructed family of solutions. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA); Complex Variables (math.CV)"

This is as expected from the viewpoint that the maximal height of the outermost path converges to the maximum of the $\textrm{Airy}_2$ process minus a parabola. Our proof is based on Riemann-Hilbert analysis of a system of discrete orthogonal polynomials with a Gaussian weight in the double scaling limit as this system approaches saturation. We consequently compute the asymptotics of the free energy and the reproducing kernel of the corresponding discrete orthogonal polynomial ensemble in the critical scaling in which the density of particles approaches saturation. Both of these results can be viewed as dual to the case in which the mean density of eigenvalues in a random matrix model is vanishing at one point. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Probability (math.PR)"

In this paper we have presented a group of coordinate transformations which are the symmetries of functions E and V. We showed that the formula for dynamical representation, which has fundamental importance in the symmetry analysis of normal modes of a molecule, follows from these symmetries. In addition, we proved that every molecule has at least one normal mode belonging to the totally symmetric (and therefore Raman-active) irreducible representation of the point group of that molecule. Next, we used symmetries of V and E to analyze possible shapes of some molecule types.

In the previous works it is shown that in these models of classical scattering process of waves, the quantum mechanical description arises as the asymptotics after a small time. In this respect, the proposed models can be considered as examples in which the quantum descriptions arise as approximate ones for certain hypothetical reality. The deviation between the proposed models and the quantum ones can arise, for example, for processes with rapidly changing potential function. Under its action the diffusion scattering process of waves will go out from the states described by quantum mechanics. In the paper it is shown that the proposed models of diffusion scattering of waves possess the property of gauge invariance. This implies that they are described similarly in all inertial coordinate systems, i.e., they are invariant under the Galileo transformations. We propose a program of further research. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.5056;Fundamentals of Geometrothermodynamics; Hernando Quevedo,  Maria N. Quevedo;  We present the basic mathematical elements of geometrothermodynamics which is a formalism developed to describe in an invariant way the thermodynamic properties of a given thermodynamic system in terms of geometric structures. First, in order to represent the first law of thermodynamics and the general Legendre transformations in an invariant way, we define the phase manifold as a Legendre invariant Riemannian manifold with a contact structure. The equilibrium manifold is defined by using a harmonic map which includes the specification of the fundamental equation of the thermodynamic system. Quasi-static thermodynamic processes are shown to correspond to geodesics of the equilibrium manifold which preserve the laws of thermodynamics. We study in detail the equilibrium manifold of the ideal gas and the van der Waals gas as concrete examples of the application of geometrothermodynamics. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.5067;A Geometric Method to Investigate Prolongation Structures for  Differential Systems With Applications to Integrable Systems; Paul Bracken;  A type of prolongation structure for several general systems is discussed. They are based on a set of one-forms in which the underlying structure group of the integrability condition corresponds to the Lie-algebra of SL (2,R), O(3), or SU(3). Each will be considered in turn and the latter two systems represent larger 3by3 cases. This geometric approach is applied to all three of these systems to obatin prolongation structures explicitly. In both 3by3 cases the prolongation structure is reduced to the situation of three smaller 2by2 problems. Many types of conservation laws can be obtained at different stages of the development, and at the end, a single result is developed to show how this can be done. ;Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.5130;Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism in locally covariant field theory; Katarzyna Rejzner;  The present work contains a complete formulation of the Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) formalism in the framework of locally covariant field theory. In the first part of the thesis the classical theory is investigated with a particular focus on the infinite dimensional character of the underlying structures. It is shown that the use of infinite dimensional differential geometry allows for a conceptually clear and elegant formulation. The construction of the BV complex is performed in a fully covariant way and we also generalize the BV framework to a more abstract level, using functors and natural transformations. In this setting we construct the BV complex for classical gravity. This allows us to give a homological interpretation to the notion of diffeomorphism invariant physical quantities in general relativity. The second part of the thesis concerns the quantum theory. We provide a framework for the BV quantization that doesn't rely on the path integral formalism, but is completely formulated within perturbative algebraic quantum field theory. To make such a formulation possible we first prove that the renormalized time-ordered product can be understood as a binary operation on a suitable domain. Using this result we prove the associativity of this product and provide a consistent framework for the renormalized BV structures. In particular the renormalized quantum master equation and the renormalized quantum BV operator are defined. To give a precise meaning to theses objects we make a use of the master Ward identity, which is an important structure in causal perturbation theory. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)"

It is shown that each cluster integral further decomposes into diagrams of intersection patterns that we classify by their loop number. This extends the virial expansion of the free-energy by an expansion in the loop order, with the Rosenfeld functional as its leading contribution. Rosenfeld's weight functions follow then from the derivation of the intersection probability by generalizing the equation of Blaschke, Santalo, and Chern. It is found that the 0-loop order can be derived exactly and reproduces the Rosenfeld functional. We further discuss the influence of particle dimensions, topologies, and geometries on the mathematical structure of the calculation. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)"

The formula is a textbook one in discrete Sturm-Liouville theory and orthogonal polynomials. A two by two matrix approach is developed and applied to Robin boundary conditions. Euler-Rayleigh sums of eigenvalues are computed. A delta potential is introduced as a simple, non-trivial example and extended, in an appendix, to the general case. The continuum limit is considered in a non--rigorous way and a rough comparison with zeta regularised values is made. Vacuum energies are also considered in the free case. Chebyshev polynomials act as free propagators and their properties are developed using the two-matrix formulation, which has some advantages and appears to be novel. A trace formula, rather than a determinant one, is derived for the Gel'fand-Yaglom function. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Spectral Theory (math.SP)"

In this article we do not search for such theories, but ask instead how one of the known candidates for a final theory, loop quantum gravity (LQG), fits into the topos-theoretical approach. In the construction to follow, we apply the 'Bohrification' method developed by Heunen, Landsman and Spitters [10, 11] to the C*-algebra version of LQG introduced by Christian Fleischhack [9]. We then bring together LQG results and methods from topos physics in a proof of the non-sobriety of the external state space S of the Bohrified LQG theory, and show that the construction obeys the standard requirements of diffeomorphism and gauge invariance. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.5755;On the causality of electrodynamics and the Aharonov-Bohm effect; Richard Kowar;  This paper presents a \emph{non-instant field model} for electrodynamics that permits a causal explanation of the \emph{Aharonov-Bohm effect} and a \emph{covariant quantization} of the respective Maxwell equations via the \emph{Gupta-Bleuler method}. Our model satisfies the following \emph{correspondence principle}: if $A^\mu$, $\vE$, $\vB$ denote the four potential, the electric field and the magnetic field of the non-instant field model, then the respective classical quantities are $\A[A^\mu]$, $\A[\vE]$, $\A[\vB]$, where $\A$ is a covariant time averaging operator. Here $\A[A^\mu]$ is interpreted as the best possible measurement of the four potential $A^\mu$. Although the Lorentz condition is not satisfied for $A^\mu$, it is satisfied for $\A[A^\mu]$. The latter fact means that the Lorentz condition does not hold for the quantized field but for its expectation value (cf. \emph{Gupta-Bleuler method} of quantization). Finally, we derive the energy conservation law of our field model and show that the field energy is quantized. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.5794;Classical Helium Atom with Radiation Reaction; G. Camelio,  A. Carati,  L. Galgani;  We study a classical model of Helium atom in which, in addition to the Coulomb forces, the radiation reaction forces are taken into account. This modification brings in the model a new qualitative feature of a global character. Indeed, as pointed out by Dirac, in any model of classical electrodynamics of point particles involving radiation reaction one has to eliminate, from the a priori conceivable solutions of the problem, those corresponding to the emission of an infinite amount of energy. We show that the Dirac prescription solves a problem of inconsistency plaguing all available models which neglect radiation reaction, namely, the fact that in all such models most initial data lead to a spontaneous breakdown of the atom. A further modification is that the system thus acquires a peculiar form of dissipation. In particular, this makes attractive an invariant manifold of special physical interest, the zero--dipole manifold, that corresponds to motions in which no energy is radiated away (in the dipole approximation). We finally study numerically the invariant measure naturally induced by the time--evolution on such a manifold, and this corresponds to studying the formation process of the atom. Indications are given that such a measure may be singular with respect to that of Lebesgue. ;Mathematical Physics (math-ph)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.5843;Fourier Law and Non-Isothermal Boundary in the Boltzmann Theory; Raffaele Esposito,  Yan Guo,  Chanwoo Kim,  Rossana Marra;  In the study of the heat transfer in the Boltzmann theory, the basic problem is to construct solutions to the steady problem for the Boltzmann equation in a general bounded domain with diffuse reflection boundary conditions corresponding to a non isothermal temperature of the wall. Denoted by \delta the size of the temperature oscillations on the boundary, we develop a theory to characterize such a solution mathematically. We construct a unique solution F_s to the Boltzmann equation, which is dynamically asymptotically stable with exponential decay rate. Moreover, if the domain is convex and the temperature of the wall is continuous we show that F_s is continuous away from the grazing set. If the domain is non-convex, discontinuities can form and then propagate along the forward characteristics. We show that they actually form for a suitable smooth temperature profile. We remark that this solution differs from a local equilibrium Maxwellian, hence it is a genuine non equilibrium stationary solution. Our analysis is based on recent studies of the boundary value problems for the Boltzmann equation but with new constructive coercivity estimates for both steady and dynamic cases. A natural question in this setup is to determine if the general Fourier law, stating that the heat conduction vector q is proportional to the temperature gradient, is valid. As an application of our result we establish an expansion in \delta for F_s whose first order term F_1 satisfies a linear, parameter free equation. Consequently, we discover that if the Fourier law were valid for F_s, then the temperature of F_1 must be linear in a slab. Such a necessary condition contradicts available numerical simulations, leading to the prediction of break-down of the Fourier law in the kinetic regime. ;Mathematical Physics (math-ph)

The phase shifts determine the potential therefore a constructive scheme for recovering the scattering potential from a finite set of phase shifts at a fixed energy is of interest. Such a scheme is suggested by Cox and Thompson [3] and their method is revisited here. Also some new results are added arising from investigation of asymptotics of potentials and concerning statistics of colliding particles. A condition is given [2] for the construction of potentials belonging to the class L_1,1 which are the physically meaningful ones. An uniqueness theorem is obtained [2] in the special case of one given phase shift by applying the previous condition. It is shown that if only one phase shift is specified for the inversion procedure the unique potential obtained by the Cox-Thompson scheme yields the one specified phase shift while the others are small in a certain sense. The case of two given phase shifts is also discussed by numerical treatment and synthetic examples are given to illustrate the results. Besides the new results this contribution provides a systematic treatment of the CT method. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

The new set of equations for the normalization constants and the nonphysical (shifted) angular momenta are free of matrix inversion operations. This simplification is a result of treating only the input phase shifts of partial waves of a given parity. Therefore, the proposed method can be applied for identical particle scattering of the bosonic type (or for certain cases of identical fermionic scattering). The new formulae are expected to be numerically more efficient than the previous ones.

Many attempts have been made and several numerical methods have been applied to solve the problem using finite element method (FEM), finite difference method (FDM), or other numerical schemes. Unfortunately most of these attempts failed to overcome the difficulty. As a FEM approach, this work can be regarded as a first promising scheme to solve the spuriousity problem completely.

Depending on natural assumptions that we make on the states, the eigenvalues of their outputs have new properties which we describe. Our motivation is provided by the additivity questions in quantum information theory, and we build on the idea that a Bell state sent through a product of conjugated random channels has at least one large eigenvalue. We generalize this setting in two directions. First, we investigate general entangled pure inputs and show that that Bell states give the least entropy among those inputs in the asymptotic limit. We then study mixed input states, and obtain new multi-scale random matrix models that allow to quantify the difference of the outputs' eigenvalues between a quantum channel and its complementary version in the case of a non-pure input. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Probability (math.PR); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

Employing the formalism of discrete exterior calculus, we introduce a simplicial Dirac structure as a discrete analogue of the Stokes-Dirac structure and demonstrate that it provides a natural framework for deriving finite-dimensional port-Hamiltonian systems that emulate their infinite-dimensional counterparts. The spatial domain, in the continuous theory represented by a finite-dimensional smooth manifold with boundary, is replaced by a homological manifold-like simplicial complex and its augmented circumcentric dual. The smooth differential forms, in discrete setting, are mirrored by cochains on the primal and dual complexes, while the discrete exterior derivative is defined to be the coboundary operator. This approach of discrete differential geometry, rather than discretizing the partial differential equations, allows to first discretize the underlying Stokes-Dirac structure and then to impose the corresponding finite-dimensional port-Hamiltonian dynamics. In this manner, a number of important intrinsically topological and geometrical properties of the system are preserved. ;Mathematical Physics (math-ph)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.6467;Exceptional orthogonal polynomials and new exactly solvable potentials  in quantum mechanics; C. Quesne;  In recent years, one of the most interesting developments in quantum mechanics has been the construction of new exactly solvable potentials connected with the appearance of families of exceptional orthogonal polynomials (EOP) in mathematical physics. In contrast with families of (Jacobi, Laguerre and Hermite) classical orthogonal polynomials, which start with a constant, the EOP families begin with some polynomial of degree greater than or equal to one, but still form complete, orthogonal sets with respect to some positive-definite measure. We show how they may appear in the bound-state wavefunctions of some rational extensions of well-known exactly solvable quantum potentials. Such rational extensions are most easily constructed in the framework of supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSYQM), where they give rise to a new class of translationally shape invariant potentials. We review the most recent results in this field, which use higher-order SUSYQM. We also comment on some recent re-examinations of the shape invariance condition, which are independent of the EOP construction problem. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

This has been obtained in two steps: In the first place the preliminary study of the corresponding field equations led to the construction of a symplectic space of solutions describing the classical theories of the considered fields. Secondly the locally covariant quantum theory of the field under consideration has been obtained through the assignment of the Weyl algebra associated to the symplectic space describing the classical theory. The last part of the thesis has been devoted to the proof of the relative Cauchy evolution for both the Proca field and the Maxwell field. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.6481;Group Fourier transform and the phase space path integral for finite  dimensional Lie groups; Matti Raasakka;  We formulate a notion of group Fourier transform for a finite dimensional Lie group. The transform provides a unitary map from square integrable functions on the group to square integrable functions on a non-commutative dual space. We then derive the first order phase space path integral for quantum mechanics on the group by using a non-commutative dual space representation obtained through the transform. Possible advantages of the formalism include: (1) The transform provides an alternative to the spectral decomposition via representation theory of Lie groups and the use of special functions. (2) The non-commutative dual variables are physically more intuitive, since despite the non-commutativity they are analogous to the corresponding classical variables. The work is expected, among other possible applications, to allow for the metric representation of Lorentzian spin foam models in the context of quantum gravity. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)"

Under certain restrictions on potentials it is proved that the eigenvalues are absorbed at zero energy threshold given that there is no negative energy bound states and zero energy resonances in particle pairs. It is shown that the condition on the absence of zero energy resonances in particle pairs is essential. Namely, we prove that if at least one pair of particles has a zero energy resonance then a square integrable zero energy ground state of three particles does not exist. It is also proved that one can tune the coupling constants of pair potentials so that for any given $R, \epsilon >0$: (a) the bottom of the essential spectrum is at zero; (b) there is a negative energy ground state $\psi(\xi)$ such that $\int |\psi(\xi)|^2 d^6 \xi= 1$ and $\int_{|\xi| \leq R} |\psi(\xi)|^2 d^6 \xi < \epsilon$.

In particular, we discuss the emergence of the Hartree equation in the so-called mean field regime (for example, for systems of gravitating bosons), and we show that the Gross-Pitaevskii equation approximates the dynamics of initially trapped Bose-Einstein condensates. We explain how effective evolution equations can be derived, on the one hand, by analyzing the so called BBGKY hierarchy, describing the time-evolution of reduced density matrices, and, on the other hand, by studying the dynamics of coherent initial states in a Fock-space representation of the many body system. ;Mathematical Physics (math-ph)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.7035;Beta Deformation and Superpolynomials of (n,m) Torus Knots; Shamil Shakirov;  Recent studies in several interrelated areas -- from combinatorics and representation theory in mathematics to quantum field theory and topological string theory in physics -- have independently revealed that many classical objects in these fields admit a relatively novel one-parameter deformation. This deformation, known in different contexts under the names of Omega-background, refinement, or beta-deformation, has a number of interesting mathematical implications. In particular, in Chern-Simons theory beta-deformation transforms the classical HOMFLY invariants into Dunfield-Gukov-Rasmussen superpolynomials -- Poincare polynomials of a triply graded knot homology theory. As shown in arXiv:1106.4305, these superpolynomials are particular linear combinations of rational Macdonald dimensions, distinguished by the polynomiality, integrality and positivity properties. We show that these properties alone do not fix the superpolynomials uniquely, by giving an example of a combination of Macdonald dimensions, that is always a positive integer polynomial but generally is not a superpolynomial. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Representation Theory (math.RT)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.7149;Status of the differential transformation method; C. Bervillier;"  Further to a recent controversy on whether the differential transformation method (DTM) for solving a differential equation is purely and solely the traditional Taylor series method, it is emphasized that the DTM is currently used, often only, as a technique for (analytically) calculating the power series of the solution (in terms of the initial value parameters). Sometimes, a piecewise analytic continuation process is implemented either in a numerical routine (e.g., within a shooting method) or in a semi-analytical procedure (e.g., to solve a boundary value problem). Emphasized also is the fact that, at the time of its invention, the currently-used basic ingredients of the DTM (that transform a differential equation into a difference equation of same order that is iteratively solvable) were already known for a long time by the ""traditional""-Taylor-method users (notably in the elaboration of software packages --numerical routines-- for automatically solving ordinary differential equations). At now, the defenders of the DTM still ignore the, though much better developed, studies of the ""traditional""-Taylor-method users who, in turn, seem to ignore similarly the existence of the DTM. The DTM has been given an apparent strong formalization (set on the same footing as the Fourier, Laplace or Mellin transformations). Though often used trivially, it is easily attainable and easily adaptable to different kinds of differentiation procedures. That has made it very attractive. Hence applications to various problems of the Taylor method, and more generally of the power series method (including noninteger powers) has been sketched. It seems that its potential has not been exploited as it could be. After a discussion on the reasons of the ""misunderstandings"" which have caused the controversy, the preceding topics are concretely illustrated. ";Mathematical Physics (math-ph)

It does not, however, tell us which value of the inner product corresponds to which root. We show that the solution is indeed uniquely determined by these values (up to root system automorphisms) at almost all times. We show by counterexample that it is possible for two different values of q to yield the same set of values for the inner products (\alpha,q). The indeterminacy introduced by the root system automorphisms gives rise to the question when the path crosses the boundary of the fundamental domains. We present an algebraic approach for constructing an indicator function containing this information. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Dynamical Systems (math.DS)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0265;Multi-frequency subspace migration for imaging of perfectly conducting,  arc-like cracks; Won-Kwang Park;  Multi-frequency subspace migration imaging technique are usually adopted for the non-iterative imaging of unknown electromagnetic targets such as cracks in the concrete walls or bridges, anti-personnel mines in the ground, etc. in the inverse scattering problems. It is confirmed that this technique is very fast, effective, robust, and can be applied not only full- but also limited-view inverse problems if suitable number of incident and corresponding scattered field are applied and collected. But in many works, the application of such technique is somehow heuristic. Under the motivation of such heuristic application, this contribution analyzes the structure of imaging functional employed in the subspace migration imaging technique in two-dimensional inverse scattering when the unknown target is arbitrary shaped, arc-like perfectly conducting cracks located in the homogeneous two-dimensional space. Opposite to the Statistical approach based on the Statistical Hypothesis Testing, our approach is based on the fact that subspace migration imaging functional can be expressed by a linear combination of Bessel functions of integer order of the first kind. This is based on the structure of the Multi-Static Response (MSR) matrix collected in the far-field at nonzero frequency in either Transverse Magnetic (TM) mode or Transverse Electric (TE) mode. Explored expression of imaging functionals gives us certain properties of subspace migration and an answer of why multi-frequency enhances imaging resolution. Particularly, we carefully analyze the subspace migration and confirm some properties of imaging when a small number of incident field is applied. Consequently, we simply introduce a weighted multi-frequency imaging functional and confirm that which is an improved version of subspace migration in TM mode. ;Mathematical Physics (math-ph)

From the discretization of the variational principles, we show that our methods are automatically symplectic and, in consequence, with a very good energy behavior. Additionally, the symmetries of the discrete Lagrangian imply that momenta is conserved by the integrator. Moreover, we extend our construction to variational integrators where the lagrangian is explicitly time-dependent. Finally, some motivating applications of higher-order problems are considered; in particular, optimal control problems for explicitly time-dependent underactuated systems and an interpolation problem on Riemannian manifolds.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0860;Quantum Systems and Resolvent Algebras; Detlev Buchholz,  Hendrik Grundling;  This survey article is concerned with the modeling of the kinematical structure of quantum systems in an algebraic framework which eliminates certain conceptual and computational difficulties of the conventional approaches. Relying on the Heisenberg picture it is based on the resolvents of the basic canonically conjugate operators and covers finite and infinite quantum systems. The resulting C*-algebras, the resolvent algebras, have many desirable properties. On one hand they encode specific information about the dimension of the respective quantum system and have the mathematically comfortable feature of being nuclear, and for finite dimensional systems they are even postliminal. This comes along with a surprisingly simple structure of their representations. On the other hand, they are a convenient framework for the study of interacting as well as constrained quantum systems since they allow the direct application of C*-algebraic methods which often simplify the analysis. Some pertinent facts are illustrated by instructive examples. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Operator Algebras (math.OA); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0881;Approximations of quantum-graph vertex couplings by singularly scaled  potentials; Pavel Exner,  Stepan S. Manko;"  We investigate the limit properties of a family of Schr\""odinger operators of the form $H_\varepsilon= -\frac{\mathrm{d}^2}{\mathrm{d}x^2}+ \frac{\lambda(\varepsilon)}{\varepsilon^2}Q \big(\frac{x}{\varepsilon}\big)$ acting on $n$-edge star graphs with Kirchhoff conditions imposed at the vertex. The real-valued potential $Q$ is supposed to have compact support and $\lambda(\cdot)$ to be analytic around $\varepsilon=0$ with $\lambda(0)=1$. We show that if the operator has a zero-energy resonance of order $m$ for $\varepsilon=1$ and $\lambda(1)=1$, in the limit $\varepsilon\to 0$ one obtains the Laplacian with a vertex coupling depending on $1+\frac12 m(2n-m+1)$ parameters. We prove the norm-resolvent convergence as well as the convergence of the corresponding on-shell scattering matrices. The obtained vertex couplings are of scale-invariant type provided $\lambda'(0)=0$; otherwise the scattering matrix depends on energy and the scaled potential becomes asymptotically opaque in the low-energy limit.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0962;Studies on the discrete integrable equations over finite fields; Masataka Kanki;  Discrete dynamical systems over finite fields are investigated and their integrability is discussed. In particular, the discrete Painlev\'{e} equations and the discrete KdV equation are defined over finite fields and their special solutions are obtained. Their investigation over the finite fields has not been done thoroughly, partly because of the indeterminacies that appear in defining the equations. In this paper we introduce two methods to well-define the equations over the finite fields and apply the methods to several classes of discrete integrable equations. One method is to extend the space of initial conditions through blowing-up at the singular points. In case of discrete Painlev\'{e} equations, we prove that an finite field analog of the Sakai theory can be applied to construct the space of initial conditions. The other method is to define the equations over the field of $p$-adic numbers and then reduce them to the finite fields. The mapping whose time evolutions commute with the reduction is said to have a `good reduction'. We generalize good reduction in order to be applied to integrable mappings. The generalized good reduction is formulated as `almost good reduction' and is proved to be a $p$-adic analog of the singularity confinement test. (*Note that this paper is intended for the author's thesis and it draws from several of our already published papers. Also note that several minor modifications have been made from the original thesis.) ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.1214;Determination of all pure quantum states from a minimal number of  observables; Damien Mondragon,  Vladislav Voroninski;  We show that for any positive integer $n$, the maps $x \in \mathbb{C}^n \mapsto \{\left|\langle x, z_i \rangle \right|^2\}_{i=1}^{4n} \in \mathbb{R}^{4n}$, where $z_i$ are the columns of four $n\times n$ unitary matrices, are generically injective modulo multiplication by a global phase factor, yielding a family of embeddings of $\mathbb{C}P^{n-1}$ into $\mathbb{R}^{4n-4}$. In particular, this implies that distribution measurements about a pure state with four generic full-rank observables are informationally complete, which is sharp for $n \geq 6$. To complement this information-theoretic study, we establish in a companion paper that the PhaseLift algorithm yields efficient phase retrieval from quadratic measurements with $O(1)$ unitary matrices, with high probability, where the unitaries are iid according to Haar measure. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Differential Geometry (math.DG); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.1299;A series test of the scaling limit of self-avoiding walks; Anthony J. Guttmann,  Jesper L. Jacobsen;  It is widely believed that the scaling limit of self-avoiding walks (SAWs) at the critical temperature is (i) conformally invariant, and (ii) describable by Schramm-Loewner Evolution (SLE) with parameter $\kappa = 8/3.$ We consider SAWs in a rectangle, which originate at its centre and end when they reach the boundary. We assume that the scaling limit of SAWs is describable by ${\rm SLE}_\kappa,$ with the value of $\kappa$ to be determined. It has previously been shown by Guttmann and Kennedy \cite{GK13} that, in the scaling limit, the ratio of the probability that a SAW hits the side of the rectangle to the probability that it hits the end of the rectangle, depends on $\kappa.$ By considering rectangles of fixed aspect ratio 2, and also rectangles of aspect ratio 10, we calculate the probabilities exactly for larger and larger rectangles. By extrapolating this data to infinite rectangle size, we obtain the estimate $\kappa = 2.66664 \pm 0.00007$ for rectangles of aspect ratio 2 and $\kappa = 2.66675 \pm 0.00015$ for rectangles of aspect ratio 10. We also provide numerical evidence supporting the conjectured distribution of SAWs striking the boundary at various points in the case of rectangles with aspect ratio 2. ;Mathematical Physics (math-ph)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.1430;Large Time Behaviour and Convergence Rate for Non Demolition Quantum  Trajectories; Tristan Benoist,  Clement Pellegrini;  A quantum system S undergoing continuous time measurement is usually described by a jump-diffusion stochastic differential equation. Such an equation is called a stochastic master equation and its solution is called a quantum trajectory. This solution describes actually the evolution of the state of S. In the context of Quantum Non Demolition measurement, we investigate the large time behavior of this solution. It is rigorously shown that, for large time, this solution behaves as if a direct Von Neumann measurement has been performed at time 0. In particular the solution converges to a random pure state which is related to the wave packet reduction postulate. Using theory of Girsanov transformation, we determine precisely the exponential rate of convergence towards this random state. The important problem of state estimation (used in experiment) is also investigated. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Probability (math.PR); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

This is used to compute explicitly the first non-trivial PDE of the corresponding intgerable generalized Drinfeld-Sokolov hierarchies. It turns out that a reduction of the equation corresponding to a short nilpotent is Svinolupov's equation attached to a simple Jordan algebra, while a reduction of the equation corresponding to a minimal nilpotent is an integrable Hamiltonian equation on 2h-3 functions, where h is the dual Coxeter number of g. In the case when g is sl_2 both these equations coincide with the KdV equation. In the case when g is not of type C_n, we associate to the minimal nilpotent element of g yet another generalized Drinfeld-Sokolov hierarchy. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Rings and Algebras (math.RA); Representation Theory (math.RT); Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI)"

The transfer operators for such systems are $J$-unitary on a infinite dimensional Krein space $(\mathcal{K},J)$ and, for energies in the bulk gap, only have discrete spectrum on the unit circle. These eigenvalues have Krein inertia which can be used to define topological invariants determining the nature of the surface modes and allowing to distinguish different topological phases.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2117;Classical integrability for beta-ensembles and general Fokker-Planck  equations; Igor Rumanov;  Beta-ensembles of random matrices are naturally considered as quantum integrable systems, in particular, due to their relation with conformal field theory, and more recently appeared connection with quantized Painlev\'e Hamiltonians. Here we demonstrate that, at least for {\it even integer} beta, these systems are classically integrable, e.g. there are Lax pairs associated with them, which we explicitly construct. To come to the result, we show that a solution of every Fokker-Planck equation in one space (and one time) dimensions can be considered as a component of an eigenvector of a Lax pair. The explicit finding of the Lax pair depends on finding a solution of a governing system -- a closed system of two nonlinear PDEs of hydrodynamic type. This result suggests that there must be a solution for all values of beta. We find the solution of this system for even integer beta in the particular case of quantum Painlev\'e II related to the soft edge of the spectrum for beta-ensembles. The solution is given in terms of Calogero system of $\beta/2$ particles in an additional time-dependent potential. Thus, we find another situation where quantum integrability is reduced to classical integrability. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Probability (math.PR); Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2242;Spectral density of a Wishart model for nonsymmetric Correlation  Matrices; Vinayak;  The Wishart model for real symmetric correlation matrices is defined as $\mathsf{W}=\mathsf{AA}^{t}$, where matrix $\mathsf{A}$ is usually a rectangular Gaussian random matrix and $\mathsf{A}^{t}$ is the transpose of $\mathsf{A}$. Analogously, for nonsymmetric correlation matrices, a model may be defined for two statistically equivalent but different matrices $\mathsf{A}$ and $\mathsf{B}$ as $\mathsf{AB}^{t}$. The corresponding Wishart model, thus, is defined as $\mathbf{C}=\mathsf{AB}^{t}\mathsf{BA}^{t}$. We study the spectral density of $\mathbf{C}$ for the case when $\mathsf{A}$ and $\mathsf{B}$ are not statistically independent. The ensemble average of such nonsymmetric matrices, therefore, does not simply vanishes to a null matrix. In this paper we derive a Pastur self-consistent equation which describes spectral density of large $\mathbf{C}$. We complement our analytic results with numerics. ;Mathematical Physics (math-ph)

In this paper we translate these results to position space. We show that the Schwinger functions are symmetric and invariant under the full Euclidean group. The Schwinger functions only depend on matrix correlation functions at coinciding indices per topological sector, and clustering is violated. We prove that Osterwalder-Schrader reflection positivity of the Schwinger two-point function is equivalent to the question whether the diagonal matrix two-point function is a Stieltjes function. Numerical investigations suggest that this can at best be expected for the wrong sign of the coupling constant. The corresponding Wightman functions would describe particles which interact without momentum transfer. The theory differs from a free theory by the presence of non-trivial topological sectors. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2818;The mathematical foundations of general relativity revisited; Jean-François Pommaret (CERMICS);"  The purpose of this paper is to present for the first time an elementary summary of a few recent results obtained through the application of the formal theory of partial differential equations and Lie pseudogroups in order to revisit the mathematical foundations of general relativity. Other engineering examples (control theory, elasticity theory, electromagnetism) will also be considered in order to illustrate the three fundamental results that we shall provide. The paper is therefore divided into three parts corresponding to the different formal methods used. 1) CARTAN VERSUS VESSIOT: The quadratic terms appearing in the "" Riemann tensor "" according to the "" Vessiot structure equations "" must not be identified with the quadratic terms appearing in the well known "" Cartan structure equations "" for Lie groups and a similar comment can be done for the "" Weyl tensor "". In particular, "" curvature+torsion"" (Cartan) must not be considered as a generalization of ""curvature alone"" (Vessiot). Roughly, Cartan and followers have not been able to "" quotient down to the base manifold "", a result only obtained by Spencer in 1970 through the ""nonlinear Spencer sequence"" but in a way quite different from the one followed by Vessiot in 1903 for the same purpose and still ignored. 2) JANET VERSUS SPENCER: The "" Ricci tensor "" only depends on the nonlinear transformations (called "" elations "" by Cartan in 1922) that describe the ""difference "" existing between the Weyl group (10 parameters of the Poincar\'e subgroup + 1 dilatation) and the conformal group of space-time (15 parameters). It can be defined by a canonical splitting, that is to say without using the indices leading to the standard contraction or trace of the Riemann tensor. Meanwhile, we shall obtain the number of components of the Riemann and Weyl tensors without any combinatoric argument on the exchange of indices. Accordingly, the Spencer sequence for the conformal Killing system and its formal adjoint fully describe the Cosserat/Maxwell/Weyl theory but General Relativity is not coherent at all with this result. 3) ALGEBRAIC ANALYSIS: Contrary to other equations of physics (Cauchy equations, Cosserat equations, Maxwell equations), the Einstein equations cannot be "" parametrized "", that is the generic solution cannot be expressed by means of the derivatives of a certain number of arbitrary potential-like functions, solving therefore negatively a 1000 $ challenge proposed by J. Wheeler in 1970. Accordingly, the mathematical foundations of mathematical physics must be revisited within this formal framework, though striking it may look like for certain apparently well established theories such as electromagnetism and general relativity. We insist on the fact that the arguments presented are of a purely mathematical nature and are thus unavoidable.

The inverse problem is to recover the manifold via the relevant measurements at the boundary (inverse data). We show that the inverse data determine a C*-algebras, whose (topologized) spectra are identical to the manifold. By this, to recover the manifold is to determine a proper algebra from the inverse data, find its spectrum, and provide the spectrum with a Riemannian structure. The paper develops an algebraic version of the boundary control method, which is an approach to inverse problems based on their relations to control theory. ;Mathematical Physics (math-ph)

Moreover, extracting the leading second order contribution to its microscopic entropy production and deriving its entropy production in the van Hove weak coupling regime, we prove that, in the mathematically and physically important XY chain, the van Hove regime reproduces the leading order contribution to the microscopic regime. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.3072;The (n,1)-Reduced DKP Hierarchy, the String Equation and W Constraints; Johan van de Leur;  The total descendent potential of a simple singularity satisfies the Kac-Wakimoto principal hierarchy. Bakalov and Milanov showed recently that it is also a highest weight vector for the corresponding W-algebra. This was used by Liu, Yang and Zhang to prove its uniqueness. We construct this principal hierarchy of type D in a different way, viz. as a reduction of some DKP hierarchy. This gives a Lax type and a Grassmannian formulation of this hierarchy. We show in particular that the string equation induces a large part of the W constraints of Bakalov and Milanov. These constraints are not only given on the tau function, but also in terms of the Lax and Orlov-Schulman operators. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI)"

Klibanov,  Michael A. Fiddy;  The problem to be studied in this work is within the context of coefficient identification problems for the wave equation. More precisely, we consider the problem of reconstruction of the refractive index (or equivalently, the dielectric constant) of an inhomogeneous medium using one backscattering boundary measurement. The goal of this paper is to analyze the performance of a globally convergent algorithm of Beilina and Klibanov on experimental data acquired in the Microwave Laboratory at University of North Carolina at Charlotte. The main challenge working with experimental data is the the huge misfit between these data and computationally simulated data. We present data pre-processing steps to make the former somehow look similar to the latter. Results of both non-blind and blind targets are shown indicating good reconstructions even for high contrasts between the targets and the background medium. ;Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.3187;Convex bodies of states and maps; Janusz Grabowski,  Alberto Ibort,  Marek Kuś,  Giuseppe Marmo;  We give a general solution to the question when the convex hulls of orbits of quantum states on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space under unitary actions of a compact group have a non-empty interior in the surrounding space of all density states. The same approach can be applied to study convex combinations of quantum channels. The importance of both problems stems from the fact that, usually, only sets with non-vanishing volumes in the embedding spaces of all states or channels are of practical importance. For the group of local transformations on a bipartite system we characterize maximally entangled states by properties of a convex hull of orbits through them. We also compare two partial characteristics of convex bodies in terms of largest balls and maximum volume ellipsoids contained in them and show that, in general, they do not coincide. Separable states, mixed-unitary channels and k-entangled states are also considered as examples of our techniques. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

There are no singularities of the metric and curvature in a bounded domain if we avoid very special choices of arbitrary functions of a single variable in our solution. This metric does not describe gravitational instantons because the curvature is not concentrated in a bounded domain.

Zotov;"  We propose multidimensional versions of the Painlev\'e VI equation and its degenerations. These field theories are related to the isomonodromy problems of flat holomorphic infinite rank bundles over elliptic curves and take the form of non-autonomous Hamiltonian equations. The modular parameter of curves plays the role of ""time"". Reduction of the field equations to the zero modes leads to ${\rm SL}(N, {\mathbb C})$ monodromy preserving equations. The latter coincide with the Painlev\'e VI equation for $N\!=\!2$. We consider two types of the bundles. In the first one the group of automorphisms is the centrally and cocentrally extended loop group $L({\rm SL}(N, {\mathbb C}))$ or some multiloop group. In the case of the Painlev\'e VI field theory in D=1+1 four constants of the Painlev\'e VI equation become dynamical fields. The second type of bundles are defined by the group of automorphisms of the noncommutative torus. They lead to the equations in dimension 2+1. In both cases we consider trigonometric, rational and scaling limits of the theories. Generically (except some degenerate cases) the derived equations are nonlocal. We consider Whitham quasiclassical limit to integrable systems. In this way we derive two and three dimensional integrable nonlocal versions of the integrable Euler-Arnold tops.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.3316;12-fold Quasicrystallography from affine F4, B6, and E6; Nazife O.Koca,  Mehmet Koca,  Ramazan Koc;  One possible way to obtain the quasicrystallographic structures is the projections of the higher dimensional lattices into 2D or 3D subspaces. In this work we introduce a general technique applicable to any higher dimensional lattice. We point out that the Coxeter number and the Coxeter exponents of a Coxeter-Weyl group play a crucial role in determining the plane onto which the lattice to be projected as well as the dihedral symmetry of the quasicrystal structure. The eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the Cartan matrix are used to determine the set of orthonormal vectors in nD Euclidean space which lead suitable choices for the projection subspaces. The maximal dihedral subgroup of the Coxeter-Weyl group is identified to determine the symmetry of the quasicrystal structure. We give examples for 12-fold symmetric quasicrystal structures obtained by projecting the higher dimensional lattices determined by the affine Coxeter-Weyl groups Wa(F4), Wa(B6) and Wa(E6) . These groups share the same Coxeter number h=12 with different Coxeter exponents. The dihedral subgroup D12 of the Coxeter groups can be obtained by defining two generators R1 and R2 as the products of generators of the Coxeter-Weyl groups. The reflection generators R1 and R2 operate in the Coxeter planes where the Coxeter element R1R2 of the Coxeter group represents the rotation of order 12. The canonical projections (strip projections) of the lattices determine the nature of the quasicrystallographic structures with 12-fold symmetry as well as the crystallographic structures with 4-fold and 6-fold symmetry. We note that the quasicrystal structures obtained from the lattices Wa(F4) and Wa(B6) and are compatible with the experimental results. ;Mathematical Physics (math-ph)

Such basic solutions are relative equilibria (CW solutions) and relative periodic solutions (MW solutions). It follows from the previous theory that the number of CW solutions grows generically linearly with time delay $\tau$. Here we show, in particular, that the number of relative periodic solutions grows generically as $\tau^2$ when delay increases. Thus, in such systems, the relative periodic solutions are more abundant than relative equilibria. The results are directly applicable to, e.g., Lang-Kobayashi model for the lasers with delayed feedback. We also study stability properties of the solutions for large delays. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD); Optics (physics.optics)"

Ferrari,  Peter Nejjar (Bonn University);  We consider the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process with initial conditions and/or jump rates such that shocks are generated. If the initial condition is deterministic, then the shock at time t will have a width of order t^{1/3}. We determine the law of particle positions in the large time limit around the shock in a few models. In particular, we cover the case where at both sides of the shock the process of the particle positions is asymptotically described by the Airy_1 process. The limiting distribution is a product of two distribution functions, which is a consequence of the fact that at the shock two characteristics merge and of the slow decorrelation along the characteristics. We show that the result generalizes to generic last passage percolation models. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Probability (math.PR)"

This model describes self-propelled particles moving in the plane and trying to synchronize their rotation motion with their neighbors. It combines the Kuramoto model of synchronization and the Vicsek model of swarm formation. We study the mean-field kinetic and hydrodynamic limits of this system within two different scalings. In the small angular velocity regime, the resulting model is a slight modification of the 'Self-Organized Hydrodynamic' model which has been previously introduced by the first author. In the large angular velocity case, a new type of hydrodynamic model is obtained. A preliminary study of the linearized stability is proposed. ;Mathematical Physics (math-ph)

The exponential sum and exponential integral on lattice cones can be viewed as linear maps on this space with values in the space of meromorphic germs with linear poles at zero. We investigate the subdivision properties-- reminiscent of the inclusion-exclusion principle for the cardinal on finite sets-- of such linear maps and establish a compatibility of these properties with respect to the convolution quotient of the coalgebra. Implementing the Algebraic Birkhoff Factorization procedure on the linear maps under consideration, we factorize the exponential sum as a convolution quotient of two maps, with each of the maps in the factorization satisfying a subdivision property. Consequently, the Algebraic Birkhoff Factorization specializes to the Euler-Maclaurin formula on lattice cones and provides a simple formula for the interpolating factor by means of a projection map. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Combinatorics (math.CO); Number Theory (math.NT)"

While reaction networks are mainly studied by chemists, they are equivalent to Petri nets, which are used for similar purposes in computer science and biology. As noted by Doi and others, techniques from quantum field theory can be adapted to apply to such systems. Here we use these techniques to study how the ""master equation"" describing stochastic time evolution for a reaction network reduces is related to the ""rate equation"" describing the deterministic evolution of the expected number of particles of each species in the large-number limit. We show that the relation is especially strong when a solution of master equation is a ""coherent state"", meaning that the numbers of entities of each kind are described by independent Poisson distributions.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.3459;Eigenvalue counting inequalities, with applications to Schrodinger  operators; Alexander Elgart,  Daniel Schmidt;  We derive a sufficient condition for a Hermitian $N \times N$ matrix $A$ to have at least $m$ eigenvalues (counting multiplicities) in the interval $(-\epsilon, \epsilon)$. This condition is expressed in terms of the existence of a principal $(N-2m) \times (N-2m)$ submatrix of $A$ whose Schur complement in $A$ has at least $m$ eigenvalues in the interval $(-K\epsilon, K\epsilon)$, with an explicit constant $K$. We apply this result to a random Schrodinger operator $H_\omega$, obtaining a criterion that allows us to control the probability of having $m$ closely lying eigenvalues for $H_\omega$-a result known as an $m$-level Wegner estimate. We demonstrate its usefulness by verifying the input condition of our criterion for some physical models. These include the Anderson model and random block operators that arise in the Bogoliubov-de Gennes theory of dirty superconductors. ;Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.3510;Calculation of the constant factor in the six-vertex model; Pavel Bleher,  Thomas Bothner;  In the present paper we calculate explicitly the constant factor $C$ in the large $N$ asymptotics of the partition function $Z_N$ of the six-vertex model with domain wall boundary conditions on the critical line between the disordered and ferroelectric phases. On the critical line the weights $a,b,c$ of the model are parameterized by a parameter $\al>1$, as $a=\frac{\al-1}{2}$, $b=\frac{\al+1}{2}$, $c=1$. The asymptotics of $Z_N$ on the critical line was obtained earlier in the paper \cite{BL2} of Bleher and Liechty: $Z_N=CF^{N^2}G^{\sqrt{N}}N^{1/4}\big(1+O(N^{-1/2})\big)$, where $F$ and $G$ are given by explicit expressions, but the constant factor $C>0$ was not known. To calculate the constant $C$, we find, by using the Riemann-Hilbert approach, an asymptotic behavior of $Z_N$ in the double scaling limit, as $N$ and $\al$ tend simultaneously to $\infty$ in such a way that $\frac{N}{\al}\to t\ge 0$. Then we apply the Toda equation for the tau-function to find a structural form for $C$, as a function of $\al$, and we combine the structural form of $C$ and the double scaling asymptotic behavior of $Z_N$ to calculate $C$. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI)"

We provide estimates on the scattering solutions and scattering data and we prove, in particular, that the scattering data at high energies uniquely determine the short range part of the potential up to the knowledge of the long range tail of the potential. The Born approximation at fixed energy of the scattering data is also considered. We then change the definition of the scattering data to study inverse scattering in other asymptotic regimes.

We present a method based on a sum-decomposition of the RDM allowing to treat not only the isotropic trap, but also general anisotropic traps. When focusing on the isotropic trap, the method is analogous to the loop-gas approach developed by W.J. Mullin in [38]. Turning to the case of anisotropic traps, we examine the RDM for some anisotropic trap models corresponding to some quasi-1D and quasi-2D regimes. For such models, we bring out an additional contribution in the local density of particles which arises from the mesoscopic loops. The close connection with the occurrence of generalized-BEC is discussed. Our loop-gas-like approach provides relevant information which can help guide numerical investigations on highly anisotropic systems based on the Path Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) method. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.3782;Integrable Quantum Hydrodynamics in Two Dimensional Phase Space; Eldad Bettelheim;  Quantum liquids in two dimensions represent interesting dynamical quantum systems for several reasons, among them the possibility of the existence of infinite hidden symmetries, such as conformal symmetry or the symmetry associated with area preserving diffeo-morphisms. It is known that when the symmetry algebra is large enough, symmetry may fully prescribe the dynamics. However, the way this is borne out in two dimensional hydrodynamics, both classical and quantum, is not fully understood. Here we take a step in clarifying this issue, by focusing on a particular example, namely that of a two dimensional phase space liquid which emerges when one considers the Calogero model, a many-body one-dimensional system interacting through an inverse square law potential. We demonstrate how the symmetry algebra of conserved quantities of the one dimensional system is expressed in terms of the incompressible Euler hydrodynamics of point vortices in phase space. Due to a formal relation between quantum hydrodynamics and classical stochastic hydrodynamics, which is inherent in the method of stochastic quantization, the ideas and methods developed here may also have application in the study of stochastic classical hydrodynamics, after suitable modifications. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI)"

Forrester;  It is known that the bulk scaling limit of the real eigenvalues for the real Ginibre ensemble is equal in distribution to the rescaled $t \to \infty$ limit of the annihilation process $A + A \to \emptyset$. Furthermore, deleting each particle at random in the rescaled $t \to \infty$ limit of the coalescence process $A + A \to A$, a process equal in distribution to the annihilation process results. We use these inter-relationships to deduce from the existing literature the asymptotic small and large distance form of the gap probability for the real Ginibre ensemble. In particular, the leading form of the latter is shown to be equal to $\exp(-(\zeta(3/2)/(2 \sqrt{2 \pi}))s)$, where $s$ denotes the gap size and $\zeta(z)$ denotes the Riemann zeta function. It is shown how this can be rigorously established using an asymptotic formula for matrix Fredholm operators. A determinant formula is derived for the gap probability in the finite $N$ case, and this is used to illustrate the asymptotic formulas against numerical computations. ;Mathematical Physics (math-ph)

When the particle visits a site x of the lattice it can emit or absorb field quanta of the reservoir at x. Under the assumption that the coupling between the particle and the reservoirs and the driving force are sufficiently small, we establish the following results: The ergodic average over time of the state of the particle approaches a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) describing a non-zero mean drift of the particle. Its motion around the mean drift is diffusive, and the diffusion constant and the drift velocity are related to one another by the Einstein relation. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)"

The main technical results derived in the present paper are $(1)$ an asymptotic perturbation theory applicable for small driving, and, $(2)$ the construction of time-dependent correlation functions of particle observables. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.4507;The heat equation shrinks Ising droplets to points; H. Lacoin,  F. Simenhaus,  F.L. Toninelli;"  Let D be a bounded, smooth enough domain of R^2. For L>0 consider the continuous time, zero-temperature heat bath dynamics for the nearest-neighbor Ising model on (Z/L)^2 (the square lattice with lattice spacing 1/L) with initial condition such that \sigma_x=-1 if x\in D and \sigma_x=+ otherwise. We prove the following classical conjecture due to H. Spohn: In the diffusive limit where time is rescaled by L^2 and L tends to infinity, the boundary of the droplet of ""-"" spins follows a deterministic anisotropic curve-shortening flow, such that the normal velocity is given by the local curvature times an explicit function of the local slope. Locally, in a suitable reference frame, the evolution of the droplet boundary follows the one-dimensional heat equation. To our knowledge, this is the first proof of mean curvature-type droplet shrinking for a lattice model with genuine microscopic dynamics. An important ingredient is our recent work, where the case of convex D was solved. The other crucial point in the proof is obtaining precise regularity estimates on the deterministic curve shortening flow. This builds on geometric and analytic ideas of Grayson, Gage-Hamilton, Gage-Li, Chou-Zhu and others. ";"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Probability (math.PR)"

Ortenzi;  Cohomological and Poisson structures associated with the special tautological subbundles $TB_{W_{1,2,\dots,n}}$ for the Birkhoff strata of Sato Grassmannian are considered. It is shown that the tangent bundles of $TB_{W_{1,2,\dots,n}}$ are isomorphic to the linear spaces of $2-$coboundaries with vanishing Harrison's cohomology modules. Special class of 2-coboundaries is provided by the systems of integrable quasilinear PDEs. For the big cell it is the dKP hierarchy. It is demonstrated also that the families of ideals for algebraic varieties in $TB_{W_{1,2,\dots,n}}$ can be viewed as the Poisson ideals. This observation establishes a connection between families of algebraic curves in $TB_{W_{\hat{S}}}$ and coisotropic deformations of such curves of zero and nonzero genus described by hierarchies of hydrodynamical type systems like dKP hierarchy. Interrelation between cohomological and Poisson structures is noted. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.4645;Elko Spinor Fields and Massive Magnetic Like Monopoles; E. Capelas de Oliveira,  W. A. Rodrigues Jr.,  J. Vaz Jr;  In this paper we recall that by construction Elko spinor fields of {\lambda} and {\rho} types satisfy a coupled system of first order partial differential equations (csfopde) that once interacted leads to Klein-Gordon equations for the {\lambda} and {\rho} type fields. Since the csfopde is the basic one and since the Klein-Gordon equations for {\lambda} and {\rho} possess solutions that are not solutions of the csfopde for {\lambda} and {\rho} we infer that it is legitimate to attribute to those fields mass dimension 3/2 (as is the case of Dirac spinor fields) and not mass dimension 1 as previously suggested in recent literature (see list of references). A proof of this fact is offered by deriving the csfopde for the {\lambda} and {\rho} from a Lagrangian where these fields have indeed mass dimension 3/2. Taking seriously the view that Elko spinor fields due to its special properties given by their bilinear invariants may be the description of some kind of particles in the real world a question then arises: what is the physical meaning of these fields? Here we proposed that the fields {\lambda} and {\rho} serve the purpose of building the fields K and M (see Eq.(38))which are Clifford valued multiform fields representing spinor fields in the Clifford bundle. They are electrically neutral and do not couple to the electromagnetic field but carry magnetic like charges which permit them to couple to a su(2) valued potential. If the potential is of short range the particles described by the K and M fields may be interacting and forming condensates of zero spin particles analogous to dark matter, in the sense that they do not couple with the electromagnetic field (generated by charged particles) and are thus invisible. We calculate the correct propagators for the K and M fields. We discuss also the main difference between Elko and Majorana spinor fields. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)"

The distribution of the smallest eigenvalue for Wishart correlation matrices is particularly interesting in many applications. In the complex and in the real case, we calculate it exactly for arbitrary empirical eigenvalues, i.e., for fully correlated Gaussian Wishart ensembles. To this end, we derive certain dualities of matrix models in ordinary space. We thereby completely avoid the otherwise unsurmountable problem of computing a highly non-trivial group integral. Our results are compact and much easier to handle than previous ones. Furthermore, we obtain a new universality for the distribution of the smallest eigenvalue on the proper local scale. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Statistics Theory (math.ST)"

The thermodynamic limit of the heat kernel and eigenvalue estimates is taken and the results are used to derive bounds for the depletion coefficient. In the case of a weakly interacting gas Bogoliubov approximation is employed. The ground state is analyzed using heat kernel methods and finite size effects on the ground state energy are proposed. The justification of the c-number substitution on a manifold is given. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.4967;Unitarity of the SoV transform for the Toda chain; K. K. Kozlowski;"  The quantum separation of variables method consists in mapping the original Hilbert space where a spectral problem is formulated onto one where the spectral problem takes a simpler ""separated"" form. In order to realise such a program, one should construct the map explicitly and then show that it is unitary. In the present paper, we develop a technique which allows one to prove the unitarity of this map in the case of the quantum Toda chain. Our proof solely builds on objects and relations naturally arising in the framework of the so-called quantum inverse scattering method. Hence, with minor modifications, it should be readily transposable to other quantum integrable models solvable by the quantum separation of variables method. As such, it provides an important alternative to the proof of the map's unitarity based on the group theoretical interpretation of the quantum Toda chain, which is absent for more complex quantum integrable models.

Let $g$ be a complex Lie algebra and let $U(g)$ be the enveloping algebra of $g$. We define a Lie algebra structure on the tensor product space of $H$ and $U(g)$, and obtain the quaternification $g^H$ of $g$. Let $S^3g^H$ be the set of $g^H$-valued smooth mappings over $S^3$. The Lie algebra structure on $S^3g^H$ is induced naturally from that of $g^H$. On $S^3$ exists the space of Laurent polynomial spinors spanned by a complete orthogonal system of eigen spinors of the tangential Dirac operator on $S^3$. Tensoring $U(g)$ we have the space of $U(g)$-valued Laurent polynomial spinors, which is a Lie subalgebra of $S^3g^H$. We introduce a 2-cocycle on the space of $U(g)$-valued Laurent polynomial spinors by the aid of a tangential vector field on $S^3$. Then we have the corresponding central extension $\hat g(a)$ of the Lie algebra of $U(g)$-valued Laurent polynomial spinors. Finally we have the a Lie algebra $\hat g=\hat g(a)+Cd$ which is obtained by adding to $\hat g(a)$ a derivation $d$ which acts on $\hat g(a)$ as the radial derivation.

Equivalently, every exceptional orthogonal polynomial system of Hermite type can be obtained by applying a Darboux-Crum transformation to the classical Hermite polynomials. Exceptional Hermite polynomial systems only exist for even codimension 2m, and they are indexed by the partitions \lambda of m. We provide explicit expressions for their corresponding orthogonality weights and differential operators and a separate proof of their completeness. Exceptional Hermite polynomials satisfy a 2l+3 recurrence relation where l is the length of the partition \lambda. Explicit expressions for such recurrence relations are given. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA); Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.5314;Anomalous g-Factors for Charged Leptons in a Fractional Coarse-Grained  Approach; J. Weberszpil,  J. Abdalla Helayël-Neto;"  In this work, we investigate aspects of the electron, muon and tau gyromagnetic ratios (g-factor) in a fractional coarse-grained scenario, by adopting a Modified Riemann-Liouville (MRL) fractional calculus. We point out the possibility of mapping the experimental values of the specie's g-factors into a theoretical parameter which accounts for fractionality, without computing higher-order QED calculations. We wish to understand whether the value of (g-2) may be traced back to a fractionality of space-time.The justification for the difference between the experimental and the theoretical value g=2 stemming from the Dirac equation is given in the terms of the complexity of the interactions of the charged leptons, considered as pseudo-particles and ""dressed"" by the interactions and the medium. Stepwise, we build up a fractional Dirac equation from the fractional Weyl equation that, on the other hand, was formulated exclusively in terms of the helicity operator. From the fractional angular momentum algebra, in a coarse-grained scenario, we work out the eigenvalues of the spin operator. Based on the standard electromagnetic current, as an analogy case, we write down a fractional Lagrangian density, with the electromagnetic field minimally coupled to the particular charged lepton. We then study a fractional gauge-like invariance symmetry, formulate the covariant fractional derivative and propose the spinor field transformation. Finally, by taking the non-relativistic regime of the fractional Dirac equation, the fractional Pauli equation is obtained and, from that, an explicit expression for the fractional g-factor comes out that is compared with the experimental CODATA value. Our claim is that the different lepton species must probe space-time by experiencing different fractionalities, once the latter may be associated to the effective interactions of the different families with the medium.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.5415;The Euler-Riemann Gases, and Partition Identities; Noureddine Chair;  The Euler theorem in partition theory and its generalization are derived from a non-interacting quantum field theory in which each bosonic mode with a given frequency is equivalent to a sum of bosonic mode whose frequency is twice ($s$-times) as much, and a fermionic (parafermionic) mode with the same frequency. Explicit formulas for the graded parafermionic partition functions are obtained, and the inverse of the graded partition function (IGPPF), turns out to be bosonic (fermionic) partition function depending on the parity of the order $s$ of the parafermions. It is also shown that these partition functions are generating functions of partitions of integers with restrictions. If the parity of the order $s$ is even, then mixing a system of parafermions with a system whose partition function is (IGPPF), results in a system of fermions and bosons. On the other hand, if the parity of $s$ is odd, then, the system we obtain is still a mixture of fermions and bosons but the corresponding Fock space of states is truncated. It turns out that these partition functions are given in terms of the Jacobi theta function $\theta_{4}$, and generate sequences in partition theory. Our partition functions coincide with the overpartitions, and jagged partitions in conformal field theory. Also, The partition functions obtained are related to the Ramond characters of the superconformal minimal models, and in the counting of the Moore-Read edge spectra that appear in the fractional quantum Hall effect. The different partition functions for the Riemann gas that are the counter parts of the Euler gas are obtained by a simple change of variables. In particular the counter part of the Jacobi Theta function is $\frac{\zeta(2t)}{\zeta(t)^2}$. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)"

The latter approach employs Fourier series in two dimensions with direct numerical integration along the third direction. As a result, the MM method converges much quicker to the exact moduli in comparison with the PWE as the number of Fourier coefficients increases. The MM method yields a more explicit formula than previous results, enabling a closed-form upper bound on the effective Christoffel tensor. The MM approach significantly improves the efficiency and accuracy of evaluating effective wave speeds for high-contrast composites and for configurations of closely spaced inclusions, as demonstrated by three-dimensional examples. ;Mathematical Physics (math-ph)

Hahne;"  A calculation is presented that shows that Feynman's path integral implies Ostrogradsky's Hamiltonian for nonsingular Lagrangians with second derivatives. The procedure employs the stationary phase approximation to obtain the limiting change of the wave function per unit time. By way of introduction, the method is applied anew to the case of nonsingular Lagrangians with only first derivatives, but not necessarily quadratic in the velocities. A byproduct of the calculation is an alternate derivation of the Legendre transformation of taking general classical Lagrangians into Hamiltonians. In both the first and second derivative cases, the outcome contains precisely the classical Hamiltonian, which represents the so-called ""symbol"" of a (not necessarily Hermitean) pseudodifferential operator acting on the wave function at an instant of time.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.5854;Hamiltonian treatment of linear field theories in the presence of  boundaries: a geometric approach; J. Fernando Barbero G.,  Jorge Prieto,  Eduardo J. S. Villaseñor;  The purpose of this paper is to study in detail the constraint structure of the Hamiltonian and symplectic-Lagrangian descriptions for the scalar and electromagnetic fields in the presence of spatial boundaries. We carefully discuss the implementation of the geometric constraint algorithm of Gotay, Nester and Hinds with special emphasis on the relevant functional analytic aspects of the problem. This is an important step towards the rigorous understanding of general field theories in the presence of boundaries, very especially when these fail to be regular. The geometric approach developed in the paper is also useful with regard to the interpretation of the physical degrees of freedom and the nature of the constraints when both gauge symmetries and boundaries are present. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.5869;Symmetry Classification of quasi-linear PDE's. II: an exceptional case; Giampaolo Cicogna;"  This short note completes the symmetry analysis of a class of quasi-linear partial differential equations considered in the previous paper (Nonlinear Dynamics, Vol. 51, 309-316 (2008)): it deals with the presence of an ""exceptional"" Lie point symmetry, not previously examined, which is admitted only if the involved parameters are fixed by precise relationships. The peculiarity of this symmetry is enhanced by the fact that it leads to a solution relevant in the theory of plasma physics, and also related to the presence of a nontrivial example of a conditional symmetry of weak type.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.5965;Relativistic particle in multiscale spacetimes; Gianluca Calcagni;  We study the action and the dynamics of a relativistic particle, uncharged or charged, in multiscale spacetimes. Invariance under reparametrizations and Poincar\'e symmetries uniquely determine the action and the line element to be the usual ones, without the weight factors typical of particle mechanics in these geometries. The resulting spacetime is multiscale only along spatial directions. This version of the system is also dictated by recovery of the nonrelativistic limit together with compatibility with Maxwell and electrodynamics field theory. Giving up all these requirements and allowing for a nontrivial weight factor in the time direction produces a modified line element and considerably complicates the dynamics in the case of a charged particle. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)"

In Nambu mechanics, a straightforward consequence of symmetry is just a relative integral invariant, a differential form which only upon integration over a cycle provides a conserved real number. The origin of the difference may be traced back to a shift in degrees of relevant forms present in equations of motion, or, alternatively, to a corresponding shift in degrees of relevant objects in action integral for Nambu mechanics. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Differential Geometry (math.DG); Dynamical Systems (math.DS)"

We observe that the free energy exhibits a third-order phase transition when the cut-off square, increasing in size, reaches the arctic ellipse---the phase separation curve of the original (unmodified) Aztec diamond. We obtain this result by studying the thermodynamic limit of certain nonlocal correlation function of the underlying six-vertex model with domain wall boundary conditions, the so-called emptiness formation probability (EFP). We consider EFP in two different representations: as a tau-function for Toda chains and as a random matrix model integral. The latter has a discrete measure and a linear potential with hard walls; the observed phase transition shares properties with both Gross-Witten-Wadia and Douglas-Kazakov phase transitions.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.6292;An Exact Expression for Photon Polarization in Kerr Geometry; Anusar Farooqui,  Niky Kamran,  Prakash Panangaden;  We analyze the transformation of the polarization of a photon propagating along an arbitrary null geodesic in Kerr geometry. The motivation comes from the problem of an observer trying to communicate quantum information to another observer in Kerr spacetime by transmitting polarized photons. It is essential that the observers understand the relationship between their frames of reference and also know how the photon's polarization transforms as it travels through Kerr spacetime. Existing methods to calculate the rotation of the photon polarization (Faraday rotation) depend on choices of coordinate systems, are algebraically complex and yield results only in the weak-field limit. We give a closed-form expression for a parallel propagated frame along an arbitrary null geodesic using Killing-Yano theory, and thereby solve the problem of parallel transport of the polarization vector in an intrinsic, geometrically-motivated fashion. The symmetries of Kerr geometry are utilized to obtain a remarkably compact expression for the geometrically induced phase of the photon's polarization. We show that this phase vanishes on the equatorial plane and the axis of symmetry. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)"

We obtain in this way four multi-parametric extensions of the known 19-vertex Hamiltonians (such as Zamolodchikov-Fateev, Izergin-Korepin, Bariev Hamiltonians). Apart from the 19-vertex Hamiltonians, there exists 17-vertex and 14-vertex Hamiltonians that cannot be viewed as subcases of the 19-vertex ones. In the case of 17-vertex Hamiltonian, we get a generalization of the genus 5 special branch found by Martins, plus three new ones. We get also two 14-vertex Hamiltonians. We solve all these Hamiltonians using CBA, and provide their spectrum, eigenfunctions and Bethe equations. A special attention is made to provide the specifications of our multi-parametric Hamiltonians that give back known Hamiltonians. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)"

Here we give an explicit recipe to construct the generally anisotropic response of the shell associated to a nanotube of any chirality in terms of the response of the shell associated to a related zigzag or armchair nanotube. The expected coupling of mechanical effects that anisotropy entrains is demonstrated in the case of a torsion problem, where the axial extension accompanying twist is determined analytically and found in good agreement with the available experimental data.

Specifically, we ""geometrize"" what is usually called a complete solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. We use some well-known results about symplectic groupoids, in particular cotangent groupoids, as a keystone for the construction of our framework. Our methodology follows the ambitious program proposed by A. Weinstein, [62], in order to develop geometric formulations of the dynamical behavior of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian systems on Lie algebroids and Lie groupoids. This procedure allows us to take symmetries into account, and, as a by-product, we recover results from [14, 29, 31], but even in these situations our approach is new. A theory of generating functions for the Poisson structures considered here is also developed following the same pattern, solving a longstanding problem of the area: how to obtain a generating function for the identity tranformation and the nearby Poisson automorphisms of Poisson manifolds. A direct application of our results give the construction of a family of Poisson integrators, that is, integrators that conserve the underlying Poisson geometry. These integrators are implemented in the paper in benchmark problems. Some conclusions, current and future directions of research are shown at the end of the paper. ";Mathematical Physics (math-ph)

The deformations considered are generalizations of the isospectral deformation that has arisen in connection with the Camassa-Holm equation for the shallow water waves. It is proved that these new isospectral deformations result in evolution equations on the mass density whose form depends on how the string is tied at the endpoints. Moreover, it is shown that the evolution equations in this class linearize on the spectral side and hence can be solved by the inverse spectral method. In particular, the problem involving a mass density given by a discrete finite measure and arbitrary boundary conditions is shown to be solvable by Stieltjes' continued fractions. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI)"

Assuming the existence and uniqueness of the steady state of the resulting process, we construct a canonical entropy production functional which satisfies the Gallavotti--Cohen fluctuation theorem, i.e., a global large deviation principle with a rate function I(s) obeying the Gallavotti--Cohen fluctuation relation I(-s)-I(s)=s for all s. We also consider perturbations of our functional by quadratic boundary terms and prove that they satisfy extended fluctuation relations, i.e., a global large deviation principle with a rate function that typically differs from I(s) outside a finite interval. This applies to various physically relevant functionals and, in particular, to the heat dissipation rate of the network. Our approach relies on the properties of the maximal solution of a one-parameter family of algebraic matrix Riccati equations. It turns out that the limiting cumulant generating functions of our functional and its perturbations can be computed in terms of spectral data of a Hamiltonian matrix depending on the harmonic potential of the network and the parameters of the Langevin reservoirs. This approach is well adapted to both analytical and numerical investigations. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Dynamical Systems (math.DS); Probability (math.PR); Classical Physics (physics.class-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01578;Group cohomology of the translational group and diffeomorphism invariant  quantum states; James Moffat,  Teodora Oniga,  Charles H.-T. Wang;  We develop a new mathematical approach to diffeomorphism invariant quantum states for the quantisation of general field theories such as general relativity and modified gravity. Treating quantum fields as fibre bundles, we discuss operators acting on the fibre algebra that defines a Hilbert space. The algebras of two types of operators are considered in detail, namely the observables as generic physical variables and the quantum operators suitable for describing symmetries and transformations. We then introduce generalised quantum states of these operators and examine their properties. By establishing a link between the commutativity and group cohomology of the translational group as a subgroup of the Poincar\'e group, we show that this leads to the construction of quantum states invariant under the action of the translational group, as the local gauge group of diffeomorphisms, with unitary representations. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01579;A bound on the averaged spectral shift function and a lower bound on the  density of states for random Schrödinger operators on $\mathbb{R}^d$; Adrian Dietlein,  Martin Gebert,  Peter D. Hislop,  Abel Klein,  Peter Müller;"  We obtain a bound on the expectation of the spectral shift function for alloy-type random Schr\""odinger operators on $\mathbb{R}^d$ in the region of localisation, corresponding to a change from Dirichlet to Neumann boundary conditions along the boundary of a finite volume. The bound scales with the area of the surface where the boundary conditions are changed. As an application of our bound on the spectral shift function, we prove a reverse Wegner inequality for finite-volume Schr\""odinger operators in the region of localisation with a constant locally uniform in the energy. The application requires that the single-site distribution of the independent and identically distributed random variables has a Lebesgue density that is also bounded away from zero. The reverse Wegner inequality implies a strictly positive, locally uniform lower bound on the density of states for these continuum random Schr\""odinger operators. ";Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01616;Surface and corner free energies of the self-dual Potts model; R. J. Baxter;  We consider the bulk, vertical surface, horizontal surface and corner free energies $f_b, f_s, f'_s, f_c$ of the anisotropic self-dual $Q$-state Potts model for $Q > 4$. $f_b$ was calculated in 1973[1]. For $Q<4$, $f_s, f'_s$ were calculated in 1989[2]. Here we extend this last calculation to $Q>4$ and find agreement with the conjectures made in 2012 by Vernier and Jacobsen (VJ)[3] for the isotropic case. All these four free energies satisfy inversion and rotation relations. Together with some plausible analyticity assumptions, these provide a less rigorous, but much simpler, way of determining $f_b, f_s, f'_s$. They also imply that $f_c$ is independent of the anisotropy, being a function only of $Q$, in which respect they resemble the order parameters of the associated six-vertex model. Hence VJ's conjecture for $f_c$ should apply to the full anisotropic model. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)"

Here we establish an extension of the well-known boson-fermion correspondence involving Schur functions and their associated (Bernstein) vertex operators: for each \pi, the modes generated by the plethystic vertex operators and their suitably constructed duals, satisfy the anticommutation relations of a complex Clifford algebra. The combinatorial manipulations underlying the results involve exchange identities exploiting the Hopf-algebraic structure of certain symmetric function series and their plethysms. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02029;The bulk, surface and corner free energies of the square lattice Ising  model; R. J. Baxter;  We use Kaufman's spinor method to calculate the bulk, surface and corner free energies $f_b, f_s, f_s', f_c$ of the anisotropic square lattice zero-field Ising model for the ordered ferromagnetic case. For $f_b, f_s, f'_s$ our results of course agree with the early work of Onsager, McCoy and Wu. We also find agreement with the conjectures made by Vernier and Jacobsen (VJ) for the isotropic case. We note that the corner free energy $f_c$ depends only on the elliptic modulus $k$ that enters the working, and not on the argument $v$, which means that VJ's conjecture applies for the full anisotropic model. The only aspect of this paper that is new is the actual derivation of $f_c$, but by reporting all four free energies together we can see interesting structures linking them. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)"

Using the asymptotic limit of a weak coupling between the pendula, we prove the nonlinear long-time stability of breathers (time-periodic solutions localized in the lattice) by using the Lyapunov method. Breathers are saddle points of the extended energy function, which are located between the continuous bands of positive and negative energy. Nevertheless, we construct an approximate Lyapunov function and estimate its evolution on a long but finite time interval. The nonlinear stability analysis becomes possible for the $\cal PT$-symmetric lattice only because of the existence of a Hamiltonian structure. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Dynamical Systems (math.DS); Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS)"

It turns out that it is a maximal subgroup of both the rank-4 Coxeter groups W(F4) and W(H4) implying that it is a group relevant to the crystallography as well as quasicrystallographic structures in 4-dimensions. First we review the pyritohedral symmetry in 3 dimensional Euclidean space which is a maximal subgroup both in the Coxeter-Weyl groups W(B3)=Aut(D3) and W(H3). The related polyhedra in 3-dimensions are the two dual polyhedra pseudoicosahedron- pyritohedron and the pseudo icosidodecahedron. In quaternionic representations it finds a natural extension to the 4-dimensions.The related polytopes turn out to be the pseudo snub 24-cell and its dual polytope expressed in terms of a parameter x leading to snub 24-cell and its dual in the limit where the parameter x takes the golden ratio.

We exploit the theory of nonclassical symmetry reduction to obtain some exact solutions. Because of the nonlinearities present in the evolution equation, one expects that the wave profile will eventually encounter distortion and steepening which in the limit of vanishing dissipation culminates into a shock wave; and once shock is formed, it will propagate by separating the portions of the continuous region. Here we have shown how the real gas effects, which manifest themselves through the van der Waals parameters $\tilde{a}$ and $\tilde{b}$ influence the wave characteristics, namely the shape, strength, and decay behavior of shocks.

Corresponding to the recurrence relations with constant coefficients for the $M$-indexed orthogonal polynomials, it is expected that the systems satisfy the generalized closure relations. In fact we can verify this statement for small $M$ examples. The generalized closure relation gives the exact Heisenberg operator solution of a certain operator, from which the creation and annihilation operators of the system are obtained. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA); Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI)"

It deals with a beautiful method, developed in the mid-nineties by V.V. Bazhanov, S.L. Lukyanov and A.B. Zamolodchikov and, as such, called BLZ. This method can be interpreted as a field theory version of the quantum inverse scattering (QIS), also known as algebraic Bethe ansatz (ABA). Starting with the case of conformal field theories (CFT) we show how to build the field theory analogues of commuting transfer T matrices and Baxter Q-operators of integrable lattice models. These objects contain the complete information of the integrable structure of the theory, viz. the integrals of motion, and can be used, as we will show, to derive the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz (TBA) and non-linear integral (NLIE) equations. This same method can be easily extended to the description of integrable structures of certain particular massive deformations of CFTs; these, in turn, can be described as quantum group reductions of the quantum sine-Gordon model and it is an easy step to include this last theory in the framework of BLZ approach. Finally we show an interesting and surprising connection of the BLZ structures with classical objects emerging from the study of classical integrable models via the inverse scattering transform method. This connection goes under the name of ODE/IM correspondence and we will present it for the specific case of quantum sine-Gordon model only.

The model contains as special cases the TASEP with parallel update, when $\tilde{p} =0$, and with sequential backward-ordered update, when $\tilde{p} =p$. We construct a two-dimensional matrix-product representation and use it to obtain exact finite-size expressions for the partition function, the current of particles and the two-point correlation function. Our main new result is the derivation of the finite-size pair correlation function. Its behavior is analyzed in different regimes of effective attraction and repulsion between the particles, depending on whether $\tilde{p} >p$ or $\tilde{p} < p$. In particular, we explicitly obtain an analytic expression for the pair correlation function in the limit of irreversible aggregation $\tilde{p}\rightarrow 1$, when the stationary configurations contain just one cluster. ;Mathematical Physics (math-ph)

Different mechanisms, such as vortical flows and emission of gravity waves, emerge from different conservation laws (CLs) for total energy and potential enstrophy. The equations are constructed using exterior differential forms and self-adjoint operators and result in the sum of two Nambu brackets, one for the vortical flow and one for the wave-mean flow interaction, and a Poisson bracket representing the interaction between divergence and geostrophic imbalance. The advantage of this approach is that the Hamiltonian and Nambu forms can be here written in a coordinate independent form. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics (physics.ao-ph); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03584;Symmetries of projective spaces and spheres; György Pál Gehér;  Let $H$ be either a complex inner product space of dimension at least two, or a real inner product space of dimension at least three. Let us fix an $\alpha\in \left(0,\tfrac{\pi}{2}\right)$. The purpose of this paper is to characterize all bijective transformations on the projective space $P(H)$ obtained from $H$ which preserves the angle $\alpha$ between lines in both directions. (We emphasize that we do not assume anything about other angles). For real inner product spaces and when $H=\mathbb{C}^2$ we do this for every $\alpha$, and when $H$ is a complex inner product space of dimension at least three we describe the structure of these transformations for $\alpha\leq\tfrac{\pi}{4}$. As an application, we give an Uhlhorn-type generalization of a famous theorem of Wigner which is considered to be a cornerstone of the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics. Namely, we show that under the above assumptions, every bijective map on the set of pure states of a quantum mechanical system that preserves the transition probability $\cos^2\alpha$ in both directions is a Wigner symmetry (i.e. it automatically preserves all transition probability), except for the case when $H=\mathbb{C}^2$ and $\alpha = \tfrac{\pi}{4}$ where an additional possibility occurs. We note that the classical theorem of Uhlhorn is the solution for the $\alpha = \tfrac{\pi}{2}$ case. Usually in the literature, results which are connected to Wigner's theorem are discussed under the assumption of completeness of $H$, however, here we shall remove this unnecessary hypothesis. Our main tools are a characterization of bijective maps on unit spheres of real inner product spaces which preserve an angle in both directions, and an extension of Uhlhorn's theorem for non-complete inner product spaces. ;Mathematical Physics (math-ph)

For simple Lie algebras, elementary and universal formulas determine the decomposition of a tensor product of an integrable highest-weight representation with the adjoint representation. Using the (refined) affine depth rule, we prove that equally striking results apply to adjoint affine fusion. For diagonal fusion, a coefficient equals the number of nonzero Dynkin labels of the relevant affine highest weight, minus 1. A nice lattice-polytope interpretation follows, and allows the straightforward calculation of the genus-1 1-point adjoint Verlinde dimension, the adjoint affine fusion tadpole. Explicit formulas, (piecewise) polynomial in the level, are written for the adjoint tadpoles of all classical Lie algebras. We show that off-diagonal adjoint affine fusion is obtained from the corresponding tensor product by simply dropping non-dominant representations. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04068;Universal hitting time statistics for integrable flows; Carl P. Dettmann,  Jens Marklof,  Andreas Strömbergsson;"  The perceived randomness in the time evolution of ""chaotic"" dynamical systems can be characterized by universal probabilistic limit laws, which do not depend on the fine features of the individual system. One important example is the Poisson law for the times at which a particle with random initial data hits a small set. This was proved in various settings for dynamical systems with strong mixing properties. The key result of the present study is that, despite the absence of mixing, the hitting times of integrable flows also satisfy universal limit laws which are, however, not Poisson. We describe the limit distributions for ""generic"" integrable flows and a natural class of target sets, and illustrate our findings with two examples: the dynamics in central force fields and ellipse billiards.

Its proof exploits Ratner's measure classification theorem for unipotent flows, and extends earlier work of Elkies and McMullen. ";"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Dynamical Systems (math.DS)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04197;Existence of charge-density waves in two-dimensional ionic Hubbard model; Tadahiro Miyao;  We rigorously investigated the charge-charge correlation function of the ionic Hubbard model in two dimensions by reflection positivity. We prove the existence of charge-density waves for large staggered potential $\Delta$ (i.e., $\frac{\Delta}{2}+2V>U$) at low temperatures, where $U$ and $V$ are the on-site and nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsions, respectively. The results are consistent with previous numerical simulation results. We argue that the absence of charge-density waves for $\Delta=0$ and $U$ are large enough (i.e., $U>\frac{\Delta}{2}$+2V). ;Mathematical Physics (math-ph)

Bleher,  Alfredo Deaño,  Maxim Yattselev;  We prove the topological expansion for the cubic log-gas partition function \[ Z_N(t)= \int_\Gamma\cdots\int_\Gamma\prod_{1\leq j<k\leq N}(z_j-z_k)^2 \prod_{k=1}^Ne^{-N\left(-\frac{z^3}{3}+tz\right)}\mathrm dz_1\cdots \mathrm dz_N, \] where $t$ is a complex parameter and $\Gamma$ is an unbounded contour on the complex plane extending from $e^{\pi \mathrm i}\infty$ to $e^{\pi \mathrm i/3}\infty$. The complex cubic log-gas model exhibits two phase regions on the complex $t$-plane, with one cut and two cuts, separated by analytic critical arcs of the two types of phase transition: split of a cut and birth of a cut. The common point of the critical arcs is a tricritical point of the Painlev\'e I type. In the present paper we prove the topological expansion for $\log Z_N(t)$ in the one-cut phase region. The proof is based on the Riemann--Hilbert approach to semiclassical asymptotic expansions for the associated orthogonal polynomials and the theory of $S$-curves and quadratic differentials. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA)"

The distributional zeta-function is a complex function whose derivative at the origin yields the average free energy of the system as the sum of two contributions: the first one is a series in which all the integer moments of the partition function of the model contribute; the second one, which can not be written as a series of the integer moments, can be made as small as desired. In this paper we present a mathematical rigorous proof that the average free energy of one disordered $\lambda\varphi^{4}$ model defined in a zero-dimensional space can be obtained using the distributional zeta-function technique. We obtain an analytic expression for the average free energy of the model. ";"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05078;Solution of the Kirchhoff-Plateau problem; Giulio G. Giusteri,  Luca Lussardi,  Eliot Fried;  The Kirchhoff-Plateau problem concerns the equilibrium shapes of a system in which a flexible filament in the form of a closed loop is spanned by a liquid film, with the filament being modeled as a Kirchhoff rod and the action of the spanning surface being solely due to surface tension. We establish the existence of an equilibrium shape that minimizes the total energy of the system under the physical constraint of non-interpenetration of matter, but allowing for points on the surface of the bounding loop to come into contact. In our treatment, the bounding loop retains a finite cross-sectional thickness and a nonvanishing volume, while the liquid film is represented by a set with finite two-dimensional Hausdorff measure. Moreover, the region where the liquid film touches the surface of the bounding loop is not prescribed a priori. Our mathematical results substantiate the physical relevance of the chosen model. Indeed, no matter how strong is the competition between surface tension and the elastic response of the filament, the system is always able to adjust to achieve a configuration that complies with the physical constraints encountered in experiments. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05091;Curvature and geodesic instabilities in a geometrical approach to the  planar three-body problem; Govind S. Krishnaswami,  Himalaya Senapati;  The Maupertuis principle allows us to regard classical trajectories as reparametrized geodesics of the Jacobi-Maupertuis (JM) metric on configuration space. We study this geodesic reformulation of the planar three-body problem with both Newtonian and attractive inverse-square potentials. The associated JM metrics possess translation and rotation isometries in addition to scaling isometries for the inverse-square potential with zero energy E. The geodesic flow on the full configuration space $C^3$ (with collision points excluded) leads to corresponding flows on its Riemannian quotients: the center of mass configuration space $C^2$ and shape space $R^3$ (as well as $S^3$ and the shape sphere $S^2$ for the inverse-square potential when E = 0). The corresponding Riemannian submersions are described explicitly in `Hopf' coordinates which are particularly adapted to the isometries. For equal masses subject to inverse-square potentials, Montgomery shows that the zero-energy `pair of pants' JM metric on the shape sphere is geodesically complete and has negative gaussian curvature except at Lagrange points. We extend this to a proof of boundedness and strict negativity of scalar curvatures everywhere on $C^2, R^3$ & $S^3$ with collision points removed. Sectional curvatures are also found to be largely negative, indicating widespread geodesic instabilities. We obtain asymptotic metrics near collisions, show that scalar curvatures have finite limits and observe that the geodesic reformulation `regularizes' pairwise and triple collisions on $C^2$ and its quotients for arbitrary masses and allowed energies. For the Newtonian potential with equal masses and E=0, we find that the scalar curvature on $C^2$ is strictly negative though it could have either sign on $R^3$. However, unlike for the inverse-square potential, geodesics can encounter curvature singularities at collisions in finite geodesic time. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Dynamical Systems (math.DS); Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD)"

In the symmetric gauge, we calculate the $SU(1,1)$ Perelomov number coherent states for this problem in cylindrical coordinates in a closed form. Finally, we show that these Perelomov number coherent states are related to the harmonic oscillator number coherent states by the contraction of the $SU(1,1)$ group to the Heisenberg-Weyl group. ;Mathematical Physics (math-ph)

We define the ensemble by the matrix probability distribution function that is proportional to $$\frac{\det (\mathbf{G} \mathbf{G}^{\dagger})^{2 L}} {\det(1_N+ \mathbf{G} \mathbf{G}^{\dagger})^{2(n+N+L)}}.$$ These matrices can also be constructed via a procedure called `inducing', using a product of a Wishart matrix (with parameters $n,N$) and a rectangular Ginibre matrix of size $(N+L)\times N$. The inducing procedure imposes a repulsion of eigenvalues from $0$ and $\infty$ in the complex plane, with the effect that in the limit of large matrix dimension, they lie in an annulus whose inner and outer radii depend on the relative size of $L$, $n$ and $N$. By using functional differentiation of a generalized partition function, we make use of skew-orthogonal polynomials to find expressions for the eigenvalue $m$-point correlation functions, and in particular the eigenvalue density (given by $m=1$). We find the scaled limits of the density in the bulk (away from the real line) as well as near the inner and outer annular radii, in the four regimes corresponding to large or small values of $n$ and $L$. After a stereographic projection the density is uniform on a spherical annulus, except for a depletion of eigenvalues on a great circle corresponding to the real axis (as expected for a real quaternion ensemble). We also form a conjecture for the behaviour of the density near the real line based on analogous results in the $\beta=1$ and $\beta=2$ ensembles; we support our conjecture with data from Monte Carlo simulations of a large number of matrices drawn from the $\beta=4$ induced spherical ensemble.

Terras;  We consider the XXX open spin-1/2 chain with the most general non-diagonal boundary terms, that we solve by means of the quantum separation of variables (SoV) approach. We compute the scalar products of separate states, a class of states which notably contains all the eigenstates of the model. As usual for models solved by SoV, these scalar products can be expressed as some determinants with a non-trivial dependance in terms of the inhomogeneity parameters that have to be introduced for the method to be applicable. We show that these determinants can be transformed into alternative ones in which the homogeneous limit can easily be taken. These new representations can be considered as generalizations of the well-known determinant representation for the scalar products of the Bethe states of the periodic chain. In the particular case where a constraint is applied on the boundary parameters, such that the transfer matrix spectrum and eigenstates can be characterized in terms of polynomial solutions of a usual T-Q equation, the scalar product that we compute here corresponds to the scalar product between two off-shell Bethe-type states. If in addition one of the states is an eigenstate, the determinant representation can be simplified, hence leading in this boundary case to direct analogues of algebraic Bethe ansatz determinant representations of the scalar products for the periodic chain. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00286;An analytic regularisation scheme on curved spacetimes with applications  to cosmological spacetimes; Antoine Géré,  Thomas-Paul Hack,  Nicola Pinamonti;  We develop a renormalisation scheme for time--ordered products in interacting field theories on curved spacetimes which consists of an analytic regularisation of Feynman amplitudes and a minimal subtraction of the resulting pole parts. This scheme is directly applicable to spacetimes with Lorentzian signature, manifestly generally covariant, invariant under any spacetime isometries present and constructed to all orders in perturbation theory. Moreover, the scheme captures correctly the non--geometric state--dependent contribution of Feynman amplitudes and it is well--suited for practical computations. To illustrate this last point, we compute explicit examples on a generic curved spacetime, and demonstrate how momentum space computations in cosmological spacetimes can be performed in our scheme. In this work, we discuss only scalar fields in four spacetime dimensions, but we argue that the renormalisation scheme can be directly generalised to other spacetime dimensions and field theories with higher spin, as well as to theories with local gauge invariance. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00287;Matrix product formula for Macdonald polynomials; Luigi Cantini,  Jan de Gier,  Michael Wheeler;  We derive a matrix product formula for symmetric Macdonald polynomials. Our results are obtained by constructing polynomial solutions of deformed Knizhnik--Zamolodchikov equations, which arise by considering representations of the Zamolodchikov--Faddeev and Yang--Baxter algebras in terms of $t$-deformed bosonic operators. These solutions form a basis of the ring of polynomials in $n$ variables, whose elements are indexed by compositions. For weakly increasing compositions (anti-dominant weights), these basis elements coincide with non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials. Our formulas imply a natural combinatorial interpretation in terms of solvable lattice models. They also imply that normalisations of stationary states of multi-species exclusion processes are obtained as Macdonald polynomials at $q=1$. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Combinatorics (math.CO); Representation Theory (math.RT)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00334;Dissipative Abelian Sandpile Models; Makoto Katori;  We introduce a family of abelian sandpile models with two parameters $n, m \in {\bf N}$ defined on finite lattices on $d$-dimensional torus. Sites with $2dn+m$ or more grains of sand are unstable and topple, and in each toppling $m$ grains dissipate from the system. Because of dissipation in bulk, the models are well-defined on the shift-invariant lattices and the infinite-volume limit of systems can be taken. From the determinantal expressions, we obtain the asymptotic forms of the avalanche propagators and the height-$(0,0)$ correlations of sandpiles for large distances in the infinite-volume limit in any dimensions $d \geq 2$. We show that both of them decay exponentially with the correlation length $$ \xi(d, a)=(\sqrt{d} \sinh^{-1} \sqrt{a(a+2)} \ )^{-1}, $$ if the dissipation rate $a =m/(2dn)$ is positive. By considering a series of models with increasing $n$, we discuss the limit $a \downarrow 0$ and the critical exponent defined by $\nu_{a}=- \lim_{a \downarrow 0} \log \xi(d, a)/ \log a$ is determined as $$ \nu_{a}=1/2 $$ for all $d \geq 2$. Comparison with the $q \downarrow 0$ limit of $q$-state Potts model in external magnetic field is discussed. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Probability (math.PR); Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00527;Examples of Complete Solvability of 2D Classical Superintegrable Systems; Yuxuan Chen,  Ernie G. Kalnins,  Qiushi Li,  Willard Miller Jr;  Classical (maximal) superintegrable systems in $n$ dimensions are Hamiltonian systems with $2n-1$ independent constants of the motion, globally defined, the maximum number possible. They are very special because they can be solved algebraically. In this paper we show explicitly, mostly through examples of 2nd order superintegrable systems in 2 dimensions, how the trajectories can be determined in detail using rather elementary algebraic, geometric and analytic methods applied to the closed quadratic algebra of symmetries of the system. We treat a family of 2nd order degenerate systems: oscillator analogies on Darboux, nonzero constant curvature, and flat spaces, related to one another via contractions, and obeying Kepler's laws. Then we treat two 2nd order nondegenerate systems, an analogy of a caged Coulomb problem on the 2-sphere and its contraction to a Euclidean space caged Coulomb problem. In all cases the symmetry algebra structure provides detailed information about the trajectories. An interesting example is the occurrence of ''metronome orbits'', trajectories confined to an arc rather than a loop, which are indicated clearly from the structure equations but might be overlooked using more traditional methods. We also treat the Post-Winternitz system, an example of a classical 4th order superintegrable system that cannot be solved using separation of variables. Finally we treat a superintegrable system, related to the addition theorem for elliptic functions, whose constants of the motion are only rational in the momenta, a system of special interest because its constants of the motion generate a closed polynomial algebra. This paper contains many new results but we have tried to present most of the materials in a fashion that is easily accessible to nonexperts, in order to provide entr\'ee to superintegrablity theory. ;Mathematical Physics (math-ph)

A general  approach based on integral kernels; Davide Fermi (Universita' di Milano),  Livio Pizzocchero (Universita' di Milano);"  This is the first one of a series of papers about zeta regularization of the divergences appearing in the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of several local and global observables in quantum field theory. More precisely we consider a quantized, neutral scalar field on a domain in any spatial dimension, with arbitrary boundary conditions and, possibly, in presence of an external classical potential. We analyze, in particular, the VEV of the stress-energy tensor, the corresponding boundary forces and the total energy, thus taking into account both local and global aspects of the Casimir effect. In comparison with the wide existing literature on these subjects, we try to develop a more systematic approach, allowing to treat specific configurations by mere application of a general machinery. The present Part I is mainly devoted to setting up this general framework; at the end of the paper, this is exemplified in a very simple case. In Parts II, III and IV we will consider more engaging applications, indicated in the Introduction of the present work.

New results include clarifications of the structure of linear fields, and a plausible formulation for nonlinear fields. Many mathematical formulations of field theory suffer greatly from either a failure to explicitly define the field configuration space, or else from the choice to define field operators as distributions. A solution to such problems is given by instead using locally square-integrable functions, and by paying close attention to this space's topology. One benefit of this is a clarification of the field multiplication problem: The pointwise product of fields is still not defined for all states, but it is densely defined, and this is shown to be sufficient for specifying dynamics. Significant progress is also made, through this choice of configuration space, in appropriately representing field states with `infinitely many particles', or those which do not go to zero at infinity. ;Mathematical Physics (math-ph)

Our main aim is to show that, up to now, the boundary conditions have not been completely understood for this model. As it turns out, and to our own surprise, restricting the well known boundary conditions stemming from the strain gradient or second gradient models to the particular case of the indeterminate couple stress model, does not always reduce to the Grioli-Koiter-Mindlin-Toupin set of accepted boundary conditions. We present, therefore, a proof of the fact that when specific ""mixed"" kinematical and traction boundary conditions are assigned on the boundary, no ""a priori"" equivalence can be established between Mindlin's and our approach.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.01235;Singularity confinement and full-deautonomisation: a discrete  integrability criterion; Basil Grammaticos,  Alfred Ramani,  Ralph Willox,  Takafumi Mase,  Junkichi Satsuma;  We present a new approach to singularity confinement which makes it an efficient and reliable discrete integrability detector. Our method is based on the full-deautonomisation procedure, which consists in analysing non-autonomous extensions of a given discrete system obtained by adding terms that are initially absent, but whose presence does not alter the singularity pattern. A justification for this approach is given through an algebro-geometric analysis. We also introduce the notions of early and late confinement. While the former is a confinement that may exist already for the autonomous system, the latter corresponds to a singularity pattern longer than that of the autonomous case. Late confinement will be shown to play an important role in the singularity analysis of systems with non-trivial gauge freedom, for which the existence of an undetected gauge in conjunction with a sketchy analysis, might lead to erroneous conclusions as to their integrability. An algebro-geometric analysis of the role of late confinement in this context is also offered. This novel type of singularity confinement analysis will be shown to allow for the exact calculation of the algebraic entropy of a given mapping. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI)"

This clearly demonstrates that the traditional Fourier multiplier representation of $|\Delta |^{1/2}$ becomes defective, while passing from $R$ to a bounded spatial domain $D\subset R$. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Spectral Theory (math.SP); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

We obtain the scaling limit of the correlation functions of Ising free fermions on an arbitrary simply connected two-dimensional domain $D$. Then, we study the analytic and algebraic aspects of the fermionic CFT on $D$, using the Fock space formalism of fields, and the Clifford vertex operator algebra (VOA). These constructions lead to the conformal field theory of the Fock space fields and the fermionic Fock space of states and their relations in case of the Ising free fermions. Furthermore, we investigate the conformal structure of the fermionic Fock space fields and the Clifford VOA, namely the operator product expansions, correlation functions and differential equations. Finally, by using the Clifford VOA and the fermionic CFT, we investigate a rigorous realization of the CFT/SLE correspondence in the Ising model. First, by studying the relation between the operator formalism in the Clifford VOA and the SLE martingale generators, we find an explicit Fock space for the SLE martingale generators. Second, we obtain a subset of the SLE martingale observables in terms of the correlation functions of fermionic Fock space fields which are constructed from the Clifford VOA. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)"

We follow polysymplectic (PS) Hamiltonian formalism on a Legendre bundle over $Y$ provided with a polysymplectic $TX$-valued form. If $X=\mathbb R$, this is a case of time-dependent non-relativistic mechanics. PS Hamiltonian formalism is equivalent to the Lagrangian one if Lagrangians are hyperregular. A non-regular Lagrangian however leads to constraints and requires a set of associated Hamiltonians. We state comprehensive relations between Lagrangian and PS Hamiltonian theories in a case of semiregular and almost regular Lagrangians. Quadratic Lagrangian and PS Hamiltonian systems, e.g. Yang - Mills gauge theory are studied in detail. Quantum PS Hamiltonian field theory can be developed in the frameworks both of familiar functional integral quantization and quantization of the PS bracket. ;Mathematical Physics (math-ph)

Wigner) are consistent with fundamental physical principles, but local fields generating them from the vacuum state cannot exist. While it is known that infinite spin states localized in a spacelike cone are dense in the one-particle space, we show here that the subspace of states localized in any double cone is trivial. This implies that the free field theory associated with infinite spin has no observables localized in bounded regions. In an interacting theory, if the vacuum vector is cyclic for a double cone local algebra, then the theory does not contain infinite spin representations. We also prove that if a Doplicher-Haag-Roberts representation (localized in a double cone) of a local net is covariant under a unitary representation of the Poincar\'e group containing infinite spin, then it has infinite statistics. These results hold under the natural assumption of the Bisognano-Wichmann property, and we give a counter-example (with continuous particle degeneracy) without this property where the conclusions fail. Our results hold true in any spacetime dimension s+1 where infinite spin representations exist, namely s > 1. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Operator Algebras (math.OA)"

The main novelty of this paper is that the Born approximation for the case of the wave-like equation is not considered. It is shown here that the phaseless inverse scattering problem for the 3-d wave-like equation in the frequency domain leads to the well known Inverse Kinematic Problem. Uniqueness theorem follows. Still, since the Inverse Kinematic Problem is very hard to solve, a linearization is applied. More precisely, geodesic lines are replaced with straight lines.

The physical domain of the system can be a bounded region of $\mathbb R^d$ for any $d \ge 1$. We assume that the temperature at the boundary of the domain is prescribed and is nonconstant, so that the system is forced out of equilibrium. Our main result is local thermal equilibrium in the infinite volume limit. In the Hamiltonian context, this would mean that at any location $x$ in the domain, local marginal distributions of NESS tend to a probability with density $\frac{1}{Z} e^{-\beta (x) H}$, permitting one to define the local temperature at $x$ to be $\beta(x)^{-1}$. We prove also that in the infinite volume limit, the mean energy profile of NESS satisfies Laplace's equation for the prescribed boundary condition. Our method of proof is duality: by reversing the sample paths of particle movements, we convert the problem of studying local marginal energy distributions at $x$ to that of joint hitting distributions of certain random walks starting from $x$, and prove that the walks in question become increasingly independent as system size tends to infinity.

We consider the Maxwell-type boundary condition, which has weaker equilibrating effect than the commonly studied diffuse reflection boundary condition. The gas region is the spherical domain in $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d=1,2$. First, without the equilibrating effect of collision, we obtain the algebraic convergence rates to the steady state of free molecular flow with variable boundary temperature. The convergence behavior has intricate dependence on the accommodation coefficient of the Maxwell-type boundary condition. Then we couple the boundary effect with the intermolecular collision and study their interaction. We are able to construct the steady state solutions of the full Boltzmann equation for large Knudsen numbers and small boundary temperature variation. We also establish the nonlinear stability with exponential rate of the stationary Boltzmann solutions. Our analysis is based on the explicit formulations of the boundary condition for symmetric domains. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)"

For the case that q is a root of unity, we propose a formula for the number of admissible solutions of the Bethe ansatz equations in terms of dimensions of irreducible representations of the Temperley-Lieb algebra; and a formula for the degeneracies of the transfer matrix eigenvalues in terms of dimensions of tilting sl(2)_q-modules. These formulas include corrections that appear if two or more tilting modules are spectrum-degenerate. For the XX case (q=exp(i pi/2)), we give explicit formulas for the number of admissible solutions and degeneracies. We also consider the cases of generic q and the isotropic (q->1) limit. Numerical solutions of the Bethe equations up to N=8 are presented. Our results are consistent with the Bethe ansatz solution being complete.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.02110;Generic properties for random repeated quantum iterations; Artur O. Lopes,  M. Sebastiani;  We denote by $M^n$ the set of $n$ by $n$ complex matrices. Given a fixed density matrix $\beta:\mathbb{C}^n \to \mathbb{C}^n$ and a fixed unitary operator $U : \mathbb{C}^n \otimes \mathbb{C}^n \to \mathbb{C}^n \otimes \mathbb{C}^n$, the transformation $\Phi: M^n \to M^n$ $$ Q \to \Phi (Q) =\, \text{Tr}_2 (\,U \, ( Q \otimes \beta )\, U^*\,)$$ describes the interaction of $Q$ with the external source $\beta$. The result of this is $\Phi(Q)$. If $Q$ is a density operator then $\Phi(Q)$ is also a density operator. The main interest is to know what happen when we repeat several times the action of $\Phi$ in an initial fixed density operator $Q_0$. This procedure is known as random repeated quantum iterations and is of course related to the existence of one or more fixed points for $\Phi$. In \cite{NP}, among other things, the authors show that for a fixed $\beta$ there exists a set of full probability for the Haar measure such that the unitary operator $U$ satisfies the property that for the associated $\Phi$ there is a unique fixed point $ Q_\Phi$. Moreover, there exists convergence of the iterates $\Phi^n (Q_0) \to Q_\Phi$, when $n \to \infty$, for any given $Q_0$ We show here that there is an open and dense set of unitary operators $U: \mathbb{C}^n \otimes \mathbb{C}^n \to \mathbb{C}^n \otimes \mathbb{C}^n $ such that the associated $\Phi$ has a unique fixed point. We will also consider a detailed analysis of the case when $n=2$. We will be able to show explicit results. We consider the $C^0$ topology on the coefficients of $U$. In this case we will exhibit the explicit expression on the coefficients of $U$ which assures the existence of a unique fixed point for $\Phi$. Moreover, we present the explicit expression of the fixed point $Q_\Phi$ ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.02112;Fusion rules for the Temperley-Lieb algebra and its dilute  generalisation; Jonathan Belletête;  The Temperley-Lieb (TL) family of algebras is well known for its role in building integrable lattice models. Even though a proof is still missing, it is agreed that these models should go to conformal field theories in the thermodynamic limit and that the limiting vector space should carry a representation of the Virasoro algebra. The fusion rules are a notable feature of the Virasoro algebra. One would hope that there is an analogous construction for the TL family. Such a construction was proposed by Read and Saleur [Nucl. Phys. B 777, 316 (2007)] and partially computed by Gainutdinov and Vasseur [Nucl. Phys. B 868, 223-270 (2013)] using the bimodule structure over the Temperley-Lieb algebras and the quantum group Uq(sl2). We use their definition for the dilute Temperley-Lieb (dTL) family, a generalisation of the original TL family. We develop a new way of computing fusion by using induction and show its power by obtaining fusion rules for both dTL and TL. We recover those computed by Gainutdivov and Vasseur and new ones that were beyond their scope. In particular, we identify a set of irreducible TL- or dTL-representations whose behavior under fusion is that of some irreducibles of the CFT minimal models. ;Mathematical Physics (math-ph)

It is shown that eigenfunction correlator localization of the corresponding effective one-particle Hamiltonian implies a uniform area law bound in expectation for the bipartite entanglement entropy of all eigenstates of the XY chain, i.e. a form of many-body localization at all energies. Here entanglement with respect to arbitrary connected subchains of the chain can be considered. Applications where the required eigenfunction correlator bounds are known include the isotropic XY chain in random field as well as the anisotropic chain in strong or strongly disordered random field. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Spectral Theory (math.SP)"

A parametrization of $SO(m,n)$ is presented, giving rise to the composition law of Lorentz transformations of order $(m,n)$ in terms of parameter composition. The parameter composition, in turn, gives rise to a novel group-like structure called a bi-gyrogroup. Bi-gyrogroups form a natural generalization of gyrogroups where the latter form a natural generalization of groups. Like the abstract gyrogroup, the abstract bi-gyrogroup can play a universal computational role which extends far beyond the domain of pseudo-Euclidean spaces. ;Mathematical Physics (math-ph)

It describes a two-dimensional quantum particle exposed to a potential consisting of two parts. One is an attractive $\delta$-interaction supported by a non-straight, piecewise smooth curve $\mathcal{L}$ dividing the plane into two regions of which one, the `interior', is convex. The other interaction component is a constant positive potential $V_0$ in one of the regions. We show that in the critical case, $V_0=\alpha^2$, the discrete spectrum is non-void if and only if the bias is supported in the interior. We also analyze the non-critical situations, in particular, we show that in the subcritical case, $V_0<\alpha^2$, the system may have any finite number of bound states provided the angle between the asymptotes of $\mathcal{L}$ is small enough. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Spectral Theory (math.SP); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

By using a method inspired by quantum mechanics, and which consist on the deformation of the phase space coordinates of the harmonic oscillator, we generalize the equation of motion of the classical linear harmonic oscillator to several classes of strongly non-linear differential equations. The first integrals, and a number of exact solutions of the corresponding equations are explicitly obtained. The devised method can be further generalized to derive explicit general solutions of nonlinear second order differential equations unrelated to the harmonic oscillator. Applications of the obtained results for the study of the travelling wave solutions of the reaction-convection-diffusion equations, and of the large amplitude free vibrations of a uniform cantilever beam are also presented. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA); Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI)"

In previous studies, expansions of irregular conformal blocks at regular singular points were obtained as degeneration limits of regular conformal blocks; however, such expansions at irregular singular points were not clearly understood. This is because precise definitions of irregular vertex operators had not been provided previously. In this paper, we present precise definitions of irregular vertex operators of two types and we prove that one of our vertex operators exists uniquely. Then, we define irregular conformal blocks with at most two irregular singular points as expectation values of given irregular vertex operators. Our definitions provide an understanding of expansions of irregular conformal blocks and enable us to obtain expansions at irregular singular points. As an application, we propose conjectural formulas of series expansions of the tau functions of the fifth and fourth Painlev\'e equations, using expansions of irregular conformal blocks at an irregular singular point.

In this paper, using the center of mass coordinates and constructing the almost invariant subspace different from theirs, we obtain the reduced Hamiltonian which does not include the vector potential terms. Using the reduced evolution we also obtain the asymptotic expantion of the evolution for a specific localized initial data, which verifies the straight motion of an atom in constatnt magnetic fields. ;Mathematical Physics (math-ph)

Such processes are formed by singular values of random matrix products, and the number of factors in a random matrix product plays a role of a discrete time. We consider in detail the case when the (squared) singular values of the initial random matrix form a polynomial ensemble, and the initial random matrix is multiplied by standard complex Gaussian matrices. In this case we show that the random process is a discrete-time determinantal point process. For three special cases (the case when the initial random matrix is a standard complex Gaussian matrix, the case when it is a truncated unitary matrix, or the case when it is a standard complex Gaussian matrix with a source) we compute the dynamical correlations functions explicitly, and find the hard edge scaling limits of the correlation kernels. The proofs rely on the Eynard-Mehta theorem, and on contour integral representations for the correlation kernels suitable for an asymptotic analysis. ;Mathematical Physics (math-ph)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.02919;Asymptotic analysis of microscopic impenetrability constraints for  atomistic systems; Andrea Braides,  Maria Stella Gelli;  In this paper we analyze a two-dimensional discrete model of nearest-neighbour Lennard-Jones interactions under the microscopical constraint that points on a lattice triangle maintain their order. This can be understood as a microscopical non-interpenetration constraint and amounts to the positiveness of the determinant of the gradient of the piecewise-affine interpolations of the discrete displacement. Under such a constraint we examine the continuum fracture energy deriving from a discrete-to-continuum analysis at a scaling where surface energy is preponderant. We give a lower bound by an anisotropic Griffith energy. This bound is optimal if the macroscopic displacement satisfies some opening-crack conditions on the fracture site. We show that if such conditions are not satisfied then the computation of the energy due to continuum cracks may involve non-local effects necessary to bypass the positive-determinant constraint on crack surfaces and at points where more cracks meet. Even when the limit fracture energy may be described by a surface energy density, this may depend on the crack orientation both in the reference and in the deformed configuration. While these effects lead to very interesting analytical issues, they call into question the necessity of the determinant constraint for fracture problems. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Optimization and Control (math.OC)"

Structure $(M,\boldsymbol{g})$ where $(\boldsymbol{g=i}^{\ast}\boldsymbol{\mathring{g}})$ is a Lorentzian manifold. Structure $(M,\boldsymbol{g,}\tau_{\boldsymbol{g}},\uparrow)$ is primely used to study the energy-momentum conservation law (for a system of physical fields (and particles) living in $M$ and to get the respective equations of motion. We construct two different de Sitter spacetime structures $M^{dSL}=(M,\boldsymbol{g,D},\tau_{\boldsymbol{g}},\uparrow)$ and $M^{dSTP}=(M,\boldsymbol{g,\nabla},\tau_{\boldsymbol{g} },\uparrow)$. Both (metrical compatible) connections are used only as mathematical devices. In particular $M^{dSL}$ is not supposed to be the model of any gravitational field in the(\textbf{GRT}).

A formula for the Komar current and its physical meaning are given. We show also how $F=dA$ satisfy in the Clifford bundle a Maxwell like equation encoding the contents of Einstein equation. We show that in GRT there are infinitely many conserved currents,independently of the fact that the Lorentzian spacetime possess or not Killing vector fields and that even when the appropriate Killing vector fields exist there does not exist a conserved energy-momentum covector (not a covector field) as in SRT. ;Mathematical Physics (math-ph)

The main object in this generalization is a quaternionic extension of the R transform which is a generating function for planar (non-crossing) cumulants. We demonstrate that the quaternionic R transform generates all connected averages of all distinct powers of $X$ and its hermitian conjugate $X^\dagger$: $\langle\langle \frac{1}{N} \mbox{Tr} X^{a} X^{\dagger b} X^c \ldots \rangle\rangle$ for $N\rightarrow \infty$.

For fermionic systems we analyse the case of Atiyah-Patodi-Singer and chiral bag boundary conditions.

In this paper we investigate the underlying geometry of a time discretization scheme for classical Hamiltonian spin systems called the spherical midpoint method. As it turns out, this method displays a range of interesting geometrical features, that yield insights and sets out general strategies for geometric time discretizations of Hamiltonian systems on non-canonical symplectic manifolds. In particular, our study provides two new, completely geometric proofs that the discrete-time spin systems obtained by the spherical midpoint method preserve symplecticity. The study follows two paths. First, we introduce an extended version of the Hopf fibration to show that the spherical midpoint method can be seen as originating from the classical midpoint method on $T^*\mathbf{R}^{2n}$ for a collective Hamiltonian. Symplecticity is then a direct, geometric consequence. Second, we propose a new discretization scheme on Riemannian manifolds called the Riemannian midpoint method. We determine its properties with respect to isometries and Riemannian submersions and, as a special case, we show that the spherical midpoint method is of this type for a non-Euclidean metric. In combination with K\""ahler geometry, this provides another geometric proof of symplecticity. ";"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Symplectic Geometry (math.SG)"

In particular we study the unitary regime, i.e., the case of infinite two-body scattering length. The Hamiltonians describing the system are, by definition, self-adjoint extensions of the free Hamiltonian restricted on smooth functions vanishing at the two-body coincidence planes, i.e., where the positions of two interacting particles coincide. It is known that for $ m $ larger than a critical value $ m^* \simeq (13.607)^{-1} $ a self-adjoint and lower bounded Hamiltonian $ H_0 $ can be constructed, whose domain is characterized in terms of the standard point-interaction boundary condition at each coincidence plane.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04258;Lie algebras of conservation laws of variational partial differential  equations; Emanuele Fiorani,  Sandra Germani,  Andrea Spiro;"  We establish a version of the first Noether Theorem, according to which the (equivalence classes of) conserved quantities of given Euler-Lagrange equations in several independent variables are in one-to-one correspondence with the (equivalence classes of) vector fields satisfying an appropriate pair of geometric conditions, namely: (a) they preserve the class of vector fields tangent to holonomic submanifolds of a jet space; (b) they leave invariant the action, from which the Euler-Lagrange equations are derived, modulo terms identically vanishing along holonomic submanifolds. Such correspondence between symmetries and conservation laws is built on an explicit linear map f_A from the vector fields satisfying (a) and (b) into the conserved differential operators, and not into their divergences as it occurs in other proofs of Noether Theorem. This map f_A is not new: it is the map determined by contracting symmetries with a form of Poincare'-Cartan type A and it is essentially the same considered for instance in a paper by Kupershmidt. There it was shown that f_A determines a bijection between symmetries and conservation laws in a special form. Here we show that, if appropriate regularity assumptions are satisfied, any conservation law is equivalent to one that belongs to the image of f_A, proving that the corresponding induced map F_A between equivalence classes of symmetries and equivalence classes of conservation laws is actually a bijection. All results are given coordinate-free formulations and rely just on basic differential geometric properties of finite-dimensional manifolds. ";Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04298;Models of free quantum field theories on curved backgrounds; Marco Benini,  Claudio Dappiaggi;  Free quantum field theories on curved backgrounds are discussed via three explicit examples: the real scalar field, the Dirac field and the Proca field. The first step consists of outlining the main properties of globally hyperbolic spacetimes, that is the class of manifolds on which the classical dynamics of all physically relevant free fields can be written in terms of a Cauchy problem. The set of all smooth solutions of the latter encompasses the dynamically allowed configurations which are used to identify via a suitable pairing a collection of classical observables. As a last step we use such collection to construct a $*$-algebra which encodes the information on the dynamics and on the canonical commutation or anti-commutation relations depending whether the underlying field is a Fermion or a Boson. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)"

Nieto;  In this contribution to the study of one dimensional point potentials, we prove that if we take the limit $q\to 0$ on a potential of the type $v_0\delta({y})+{2}v_1\delta'({y})+w_0\delta({y}-q)+ {2} w_1\delta'({y}-q)$, we obtain a new point potential of the type ${u_0} \delta({y})+{2 u_1} \delta'({y})$, when $ u_0$ and $ u_1$ are related to $v_0$, $v_1$, $w_0$ and $w_1$ by a law having the structure of a group. This is the Borel subgroup of $SL_2({\mathbb R})$. We also obtain the non-abelian addition law from the scattering data. The spectra of the Hamiltonian in the exceptional cases emerging in the study are also described in full detail. It is shown that for the $v_1=\pm 1$, $w_1=\pm 1$ values of the $\delta^\prime$ couplings the singular Kurasov matrices become equivalent to Dirichlet at one side of the point interaction and Robin boundary conditions at the other side. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04400;Kinematical Foundations of Loop Quantum Cosmology; Christian Fleischhack;"  First, we review the $C^\ast$-algebraic foundations of loop quantization, in particular, the construction of quantum configuration spaces and the implementation of symmetries. Then, we apply these results to loop quantum gravity, focusing on the space of generalized connections and on measures thereon. Finally, we study the realm of homogeneous isotropic loop quantum cosmology: once viewed as the loop quantization of classical cosmology, once seen as the symmetric sector of loop quantum gravity. It will turn out that both theories differ, i.e., quantization and symmetry reduction do not commute. Moreover, we will present a uniqueness result for kinematical measures. These last two key results have originally been due to Hanusch; here, we give drastically simplified and direct proofs.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04505;Explicit Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formulae for some specific Lie  algebras; Alexander Van-Brunt (Victoria University of Wellington),  Matt Visser (Victoria University of Wellington);"  In a previous article, [arXiv:1501.02506, JPhysA {\bf48} (2015) 225207], we demonstrated that whenever $[X,Y] = u X + vY + cI$ the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula reduces to the tractable closed-form expression \[ Z(X,Y)=\ln( e^X e^Y ) = X+Y+ f(u,v) \; [X,Y], \] where $f(u,v)=f(v,u)$ is explicitly given by \[ f(u,v) = {(u-v)e^{u+v}-(ue^u-ve^v)\over u v (e^u - e^v)} = {(u-v)-(ue^{-v}-ve^{-u})\over u v (e^{-v} - e^{-u})}. \] This is much more general than the results usually presented for either the Heisenberg commutator $[P,Q]=-i\hbar I$, or the creation-destruction commutator $[a,a^\dagger]=I$. In the current article we shall further generalize and extend this result, primarily by relaxing the input assumptions. We shall work with the structure constants $f_{ab}{}^c$ of the Lie algebra, (defined by $[T_a,T_b] = f_{ab}{}^c \; T_c$), and identify suitable constraints one can place on the structure constants to make the Baker--Campbell--Hausdorff formula tractable. We shall also develop related results using the commutator sub-algebra $[\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{g}]$ of the relevant Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. Under suitable conditions, and taking $L_A B = [A,B]$ as usual, we shall demonstrate that \[ \ln( e^X e^Y ) = X + Y + {I \over e^{-L_X} - e^{+L_Y} } \left( {I-e^{-L_X}\over L_X} + {I-e^{+L_Y}\over L_Y} \right) [X,Y]. \] ";"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04528;Digital calculus and finite groups in quantum mechanics; Vladimir Garcia-Morales;  By means of a digit function that has been introduced in a recent formulation of classical and quantum mechanics, we provide a new construction of some infinite families of finite groups, both abelian and nonabelian, of importance for theoretical, atomic and molecular physics. Our construction is not based on algebraic relationships satisfied by generators, but in establishing the appropriate law of composition that induces the group structure on a finite set of nonnegative integers (the cardinal of the set being equal to the order of the group) thus making computations with finite groups quite straightforward. We establish the abstract laws of composition for infinite families of finite groups including all cyclic groups (and any direct sums of them), dihedral, dicyclic and other metacyclic groups, the symmetric groups of permutations of $p$ symbols and the alternating groups of even permutations. Specific examples are given to illustrate the expressions for the law of composition obtained in each case. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Group Theory (math.GR)"

The classical r- matrices for these Lie bialgebras and Poisson structures on all of the related four dimensional Poisson-Lie groups are also obtained. Some new integrable models for which the Poisson-Lie group plays the role as a phase space and its dual Lie group plays the role of a symmetry group of the system, are obtained. ;Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04684;Bose-Einstein condensation and condensation of $q$-particles in  equilibrium and non equilibrium thermodynamics: a new approach; Luigi Accardi,  Francesco Fidaleo;  In the setting of the principle of local equilibrium which asserts that the temperature is a function of the energy levels of the system, we exhibit plenty of steady states describing the condensation of free Bosons which are not in thermal equilibrium. The surprising facts are that the condensation can occur both in dimension less than 3 in configuration space, and even in excited energy levels. The investigation relative to non equilibrium suggests a new approach to the condensation, which allows an unified analysis involving also the condensation of $q$-particles, $-1\leq q\leq 1$, where $q=\pm1$ corresponds to the Bose/Fermi alternative. For such $q$-particles, the condensation can occur only if $0<q\leq1$, the case 1 corresponding to the standard Bose-Einstein condensation. In this more general approach, completely new and unexpected states exhibiting condensation phenomena naturally occur also in the usual situation of equilibrium thermodynamics. The new approach proposed in the present paper for the situation of $2^\text{nd}$ quantisation of free particles, is naturally based on the theory of the Distributions, which might hopefully be extended to more general cases ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Operator Algebras (math.OA)"

This involves a proper understanding of how Wick's theorem allows one to evaluate integrals perturbatively, i.e., as a series expansion in a formal parameter irrespective of convergence properties. We establish invariance properties of such a Wick expansion under coordinate changes and the action of a Lie group of symmetries, and we use this to study essential features of path integral manipulations, including coordinate changes, Ward identities, Schwinger-Dyson equations, Faddeev-Popov gauge-fixing, and eliminating fields by their equation of motion. We also discuss the asymptotic nature of the Wick expansion and the implications this has for defining path integrals perturbatively and nonperturbatively. ;"Mathematical Physics (math-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Differential Geometry (math.DG)"

We first formally derive a kinetic model for the fiber and cross-links distribution functions. We then consider the fast linking/unlinking regime in which the model can be reduced to the fiber distribution function only and investigate its diffusion limit. The resulting macroscopic model consists of a system of nonlinear diffusion equations for the fiber density and mean orientation. In the case of a homogeneous fiber density, we show that the model is elliptic. ;Mathematical Physics (math-ph)

These are applied to prove that the local eigenvalue statistics $\xi^\omega_{E}$ and $\xi^\omega_{E^\prime}$, associated with two energies $E$ and $E'$ satisfying $|E - E'| > 4d$, are independent. That is, if $I,J$ are two bounded intervals, the random variables $\xi^\omega_{E}(I)$ and $\xi^\omega_{E'}(J)$, are independent and distributed according to a compound Poisson distribution whose L\'evy measure has finite support. We also prove that the extended Minami estimate implies that the eigenvalues in the localization region have multiplicity at most the rank of the perturbation. ;Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
