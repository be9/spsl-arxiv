https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00154;Representable Chow classes of a product of projective spaces; Federico Castillo,  Binglin Li,  Naizhen Zhang;  Inside a product of projective spaces, we try to understand which Chow classes come from irreducible subvarieties. The answer is closely related to the theory of integer polymatroids. The support of a representable class can be (partially) characterized as some integer point inside a particular polymatroid. If the class is multiplicity-free, we obtain a complete characterization in terms of representable polymatroids. We also generalize some of the results to the case of products of Grassmannians. ;"Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Combinatorics (math.CO)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00184;Remarks on Kawamata's effective non-vanishing conjecture for manifolds  with trivial first Chern classes; Yalong Cao,  Chen Jiang;"  Kawamata proposed a conjecture predicting that every nef and big line bundle on a smooth projective variety with trivial first Chern class has nontrivial global sections. We verify this conjecture for several cases, including (i) all hyperk\""{a}hler varieties of dimension $\leq 6$; (ii) all known hyperk\""{a}hler varieties except for O'Grady's 10-dimensional example; (iii) general complete intersection Calabi-Yau varieties in certain Fano manifolds (e.g. toric ones). Moreover, we investigate the effectivity of Todd classes of hyperk\""{a}hler varieties and Calabi-Yau varieties. We prove that the fourth Todd classes are ""fakely effective"" for all hyperk\""{a}hler varieties and general complete intersection Calabi-Yau varieties in products of projective spaces.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00208;$F$-divided sheaves trivialized by dominant maps are essentially finite; Fabio Tonini,  Lei Zhang;  By a result of Biswas and Dos Santos, on a smooth and projective variety over an algebraically closed field, a vector bundle trivialized by a proper and surjective map is essentially finite, that is it corresponds to a representation of the Nori fundamental group scheme. In this paper we obtain similar results for non-proper non-smooth algebraic stacks over arbitrary fields of characteristic $p>0$. As by-product we have the following partial generalization of the Biswas-Dos Santos' result in positive characteristic: on a pseudo-proper and inflexible stack of finite type over $k$ a vector bundle which is trivialized by a proper and flat map is essentially finite. ;"Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Number Theory (math.NT)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00372;The inertia operator on the motivic Hall algebra; Kai Behrend,  Pooya Ronagh;  We study the action of the inertia operator on the motivic Hall algebra, and prove that it is diagonalizable. This leads to a filtration of the Hall algebra, whose associated graded algebra is commutative. In particular, the degree 1 subspace forms a Lie algebra, which we call the Lie algebra of virtually indecomposable elements, following Joyce. We prove that the integral of virtually indecomposable elements admits an Euler characteristic specialization. In order to take advantage of the fact that our inertia groups are unit groups in algebras, we introduce the notion of algebroid. ;"Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Quantum Algebra (math.QA)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00556;The Eigenvalue Spectrum of the Inertia Operator; Kai Behrend,  Pooya Ronagh;  We view the inertia construction of algebraic stacks as an operator on the Grothendieck groups of various categories of algebraic stacks. We show that the inertia operator is locally finite and diagonalizable. This is proved for the Grothendieck group of Deligne-Mumford stacks over a base scheme and the category of quasi-split Artin stacks defined over a field of characteristic zero. Motivated by the quasi-splitness condition, in [2] we consider the inertia operator of the Hall algebra of algebroids, and applications of it in generalized Donaldson-Thomas theory. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00586;Some remarks on log surfaces; Haidong Liu;  Fujino and Tanaka established the minimal model theory for $\mathbb Q$-factorial log surfaces in characteristic $0$ and $p$, respectively. We prove that every intermediate surface has only log terminal singularities if we run the minimal model program starting with a pair consisting of a smooth surface and a boundary $\mathbb R$-divisor. We further show that such a property does not hold if the initial surface is singular. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00652;Gromov--Witten theory of $[\bC^2/\bZ_{n+1}]\times \bP^1$; Zijun Zhou,  Zhengyu Zong;  We compute the relative orbifold Gromov--Witten invariants of $[\bC^2/\bZ_{n+1}]\times \bP^1$, with respect to vertical fibers. Via a vanishing property of the Hurwitz--Hodge bundle, 2-point rubber invariants are calculated explicitly using Pixton's formula for the double ramification cycle, and the orbifold quantum Riemann--Roch. As a result parallel to its crepant resolution counterpart for $\cA_n$, the GW/DT/Hilb/Sym correspondence is established for $[\bC^2/\bZ_{n+1}]$. The computation also implies the crepant resolution conjecture for relative orbifold Gromov--Witten theory of $[\bC^2/\bZ_{n+1}]\times \bP^1$. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00754;Semi-regular varieties and variational Hodge conjecture; Ananyo Dan,  Inder Kaur;  We know that semi-regular sub-varieties satisfy the variational Hodge conjecture i.e., given a family of smooth projective varieties $\pi:\mathcal{X} \to B$, a special fiber $\mathcal{X}_o$ and a semi-regular subvariety $Z \subset \mathcal{X}_o$, the cohomology class corresponding to $Z$ remains a Hodge class (as $\mathcal{X}_o$ deforms along $B$) if and only if $Z$ remains an algebraic cycle. In this article, we investigate examples of such sub-varieties. In particular, we prove that any smooth projective variety $Z$ of dimension $n$ is a semi-regular sub-variety of a smooth projective hypersurface in $\mathbb{P}^{2n+1}$ of large enough degree. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00756;A note on the determinant map; Ananyo Dan,  Inder Kaur;  Classically, there exists a determinant map from the moduli space of semi-stable sheaves on a smooth, projective variety to the Picard scheme. Unfortunately, if the underlying variety is singular, then such a map does not exist. In the case the underlying variety is a nodal curve, a similar map was produced by Bhosle on a stratification of the moduli space of semi-stable sheaves. In this note, we generalize this result to the higher dimension case. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00792;Moduli of fibered surface pairs from twisted stable maps; Kenneth Ascher,  Dori Bejleri;  We use the theory of twisted stable maps to Deligne-Mumford stacks to construct compactifications of the moduli space of pairs $(X \to C, S + F)$ where $X \to C$ is a fibered surface, $S$ is a sum of sections, $F$ is a sum of marked fibers, and $(X, S + F)$ is a stable pair in the sense of the minimal model program. This generalizes the work of Abramovich-Vistoli, who compactified the moduli space of fibered surfaces without marked fibers. Furthermore, we compare our compactification to Alexeev's space of stable maps and the KSBA compactification of stable pairs. As an application, we describe the boundary of the compactification of the moduli space of elliptic surfaces. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)

The Prym-Green Conjecture is known to hold in odd genus for almost all levels. Probabilistic arguments strongly suggested that the conjecture might fail for level 2 and genus 8 or 16. In this paper, we present three geometric proofs of the surprising failure of the Prym-Green Conjecture in genus 8, hoping that the methods introduced here will shed light on all the exceptions to the Prym-Green Conjecture for genera with high divisibility by 2. ;"Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Commutative Algebra (math.AC)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01048;Rationality of capped descendent vertex in $K$-theory; Andrey Smirnov;  In this paper we analyze the fundamental solution of the \textit{quantum difference equation} (qde) for the moduli space of instantons on two-dimensional projective space. The qde is a $K$-theoretic generalization of the quantum differential equation in quantum cohomology. As in the quantum cohomology case, the fundamental solution of qde provides the capping operator in $K$-theory (the rubber part of the capped vertex). We study the dependence of the capping operator on the equivariant parameters $a_i$ of the torus acting on the instanton moduli space by changing the framing. We prove that the capping operator factorizes at $a_i\to 0$. The rationality of the $K$-theoretic 1-leg capped descendent vertex follows from factorization of the capping operator as a simple corollary. ;"Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Representation Theory (math.RT)"

We determine the defining equation of a cyclic covering of degree $p$ of the projective line by a Mumford curve over a complete discrete valuation field of positive characteristic $p$.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01098;Effective faithful tropicalizations associated to linear systems on  curves; Shu Kawaguchi,  Kazuhiko Yamaki;  For a connected smooth projective curve $X$ of genus $g$, global sections of any line bundle $L$ with $\deg(L) \geq 2g+ 1$ give an embedding of the curve into projective space. We consider an analogous statement for a Berkovich skeleton in nonarchimedean geometry, in which projective space is replaced by tropical projective space, and an embedding is replaced by a homeomorphism onto its image preserving integral structures (called a faithful tropicalization). Let $K$ be an algebraically closed field which is complete with respect to a non-trivial nonarchimedean value. Suppose that $X$ is defined over $K$ and has genus $g \geq 2$ and that $\Gamma$ is a skeleton (that is allowed to have ends) of the analytification $X^{\mathrm{an}}$ of $X$ in the sense of Berkovich. We show that if $\deg(L) \geq 3g-1$, then global sections of $L$ give a faithful tropicalization of $\Gamma$ into tropical projective space. As an application, when $Y$ is a suitable affine curve, we describe the analytification $Y^{\mathrm{an}}$ as the limit of tropicalizations of an effectively bounded degree. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01099;Effective faithful tropicalizations associated to adjoint linear systems; Shu Kawaguchi,  Kazuhiko Yamaki;  Let $R$ be a complete discrete valuation ring of equi-characteristic zero with fractional field $K$. Let $X$ be a connected, smooth projective variety of dimension $d$ over $K$, and let $L$ be an ample line bundle over $X$. We assume that there exist a regular strictly semistable model $\mathscr{X}$ of $X$ over $R$ and a relatively ample line bundle $\mathscr{L}$ over $\mathscr{X}$ with $\mathscr{L}|_{X} \cong L$. Let $S(\mathscr{X})$ be the skeleton associated to $\mathscr{X}$ in the Berkovich analytification $X^{\mathrm{an}}$ of $X$. In this article, we study when $S(\mathscr{X})$ is faithfully tropicalized into tropical projective space by the adjoint linear system $|L^{\otimes m} \otimes \omega_X|$. Roughly speaking, our results show that, if $m$ is an integer such that the adjoint bundle is basepoint free, then the adjoint linear system admits a faithful tropicalization of $S(\mathscr{X})$. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)

Our approach rests on intersection theory and Terracini's classification of defective surfaces. The analogous identifiability result is shown to be false for mixtures of Gaussians in dimension three and higher. Their moments up to third order define projective varieties that are defective. Our geometric study suggests an extension of the Alexander-Hirschowitz Theorem for Veronese varieties to the Gaussian setting. ;"Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Statistics Theory (math.ST)"

We further prove flexibility of total coordinate spaces of Cox rings of del Pezzo surfaces. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)

We show that the rank of the Picard group is either 10, 14 or 18 and the fixed locus is the disjoint union of elliptic curves, rational curves and points, whose number does not exceed 1, 2, respectively 14.

Graber and Pandharipande proved that these classes are nontatoulogical. In this note we show that their result can be extended to prove that $[\overline{\mathcal{B}}_{g}]$ is nontautological for $g\geq 12$ and that $[\mathcal{B}_{12}]$ is nontautological. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)

This is part of a project to use perverse sheaves on the topological reductive Borel-Serre compactification of a Hermitian locally symmetric space as a tool to study perverse sheaves on the Baily-Borel compactification, a projective algebraic variety. We sketch why the decomposition theorem holds for the natural map between the reductive Borel-Serre and the Baily-Borel compactifications. We demonstrate how to calculate extensions of simple perverse sheaves on the reductive Borel-Serre compactification and illustrate with the example of Sp(4,R). ;"Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Algebraic Topology (math.AT); Number Theory (math.NT)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01220;Perverse obstructions to flat regular compactifications; Patrick Brosnan;  Suppose $\pi:W\to S$ is a smooth, proper morphism over a variety $S$ contained as a Zariski open subset in a smooth, complex variety $\bar S$. The goal of this note is to consider the question of when $\pi$ admits a regular, flat compactification. In other words, when does there exists a flat, proper morphism $\bar\pi:\overline{W}\to\bar S$ extending $\pi$ with $\overline{W}$ regular? One interesting recent example of this occurs in the preprint arXiv:1602.05534 of Laza, Sacca and Voisin where $\pi$ is a family of abelian $5$-folds over a Zariski open subset $S$ of $\bar S=\mathbb{P}^5$. In that paper, the authors construct $\overline{W}$ using the theory of compactified Prym varieties and show that it is a holomorphic symplectic manifold (deformation equivalent to O'Grady's $10$-dimensional example). In this note I observe that non-vanishing of the local intersection cohomology of $R^1\pi_*\mathbb{Q}$ in degree at least $2$ provides an obstruction to finding a $\bar\pi$. Moreover, non-vanishing in degree $1$ provides an obstruction to finding a $\bar\pi$ with irreducible fibers. Then I observe that, in some cases of interest, results of Brylinski, Beilinson and Schnell can be used to compute the intersection cohomology. I also give examples involving cubic $4$-folds, and ask a question about palindromicity of hyperplane sections. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01583;Monodromy of the $SL(n)$ and $GL(n)$ Hitchin fibrations; David Baraglia;  We compute the monodromy of the Hitchin fibration for the moduli space of $L$-twisted $SL(n,\mathbb{C})$ and $GL(n,\mathbb{C})$-Higgs bundles for any $n$, on a compact Riemann surface of genus $g>1$. We require the line bundle $L$ to either be the canonical bundle or satisfy $deg(L) > 2g-2$. The monodromy group is generated by Picard-Lefschetz transformations associated to vanishing cycles of singular spectral curves. We construct such vanishing cycles explicitly and use this to show that the $SL(n,\mathbb{C})$ monodromy group is a {\em skew-symmetric vanishing lattice} in the sense of Janssen. Using the classification of vanishing lattices over $\mathbb{Z}$, we completely determine the structure of the monodromy groups of the $SL(n,\mathbb{C})$ and $GL(n,\mathbb{C})$ Hitchin fibrations. As an application we determine the image of the restriction map from the cohomology of the moduli space of Higgs bundles to the cohomology of a non-singular fibre of the Hitchin fibration. ;"Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Differential Geometry (math.DG)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01687;Noncommutative enhancements of contractions; Will Donovan,  Michael Wemyss;  Given a contraction of a variety X to a base Y, we enhance the locus in Y over which the contraction is not an isomorphism with a certain sheaf of noncommutative rings D, under mild assumptions which hold in the case of (1) crepant partial resolutions admitting a tilting bundle with trivial summand, and (2) all contractions with fibre dimension at most one. In all cases, this produces a global invariant. In the crepant setting, we then apply this to study derived autoequivalences of X. We work generally, dropping many of the usual restrictions, and so both extend and unify existing approaches. In full generality we construct a new endofunctor of the derived category of X by twisting over D, and then, under appropriate restrictions on singularities, give conditions for when it is an autoequivalence. We show that these conditions hold automatically when the non-isomorphism locus in Y has codimension 3 or more, which covers determinantal flops, and we also control the conditions when the non-isomorphism locus has codimension 2, which covers 3-fold divisor-to-curve contractions. ;"Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Representation Theory (math.RT)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01731;Generalized Artin-Mumford curves over finite fields; Maria Montanucci,  Giovanni Zini;"  Let $\mathbb{F}_q$ be the finite field of order $q=p^h$ with $p>2$ prime and $h>1$, and let $\mathbb{F}_{\bar{q}}$ be a subfield of $\mathbb{F}_q$. From any two $\bar{q}$-linearized polynomials $L_1,L_2 \in \overline{\mathbb{F}}_q[T]$ of degree $q$, we construct an ordinary curve $\mathcal{X}_{(L_1,L_2)}$ of genus $(q-1)^2$ which is a generalized Artin-Schreier cover of the projective line $\mathbb{P}^1$. The automorphism group of $\mathcal{X}_{(L_1,L_2)}$ over the algebraic closure $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_q$ of $\mathbb{F}_q$ contains a semidirect product $\Sigma \rtimes \Gamma$ of an elementary abelian $p$-group $\Sigma$ of order $q^2$ by a cyclic group $\Gamma$ of order $\bar{q}-1$. We show that for $L_1 \neq L_2$, $\Sigma \rtimes \Gamma$ is the full automorphism group ${\rm Aut}(\mathcal{X}_{(L_1,L_2)})$ over $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_q$; for $L_1=L_2$ there exists an extra involution and ${\rm Aut}(\mathcal{X}_{(L_1,L_1)})=\Sigma \rtimes \Delta$ with a dihedral group $\Delta$ of order $2(\bar{q}-1)$ containing $\Gamma$. Two different choices of the pair $\{L_1,L_2\}$ may produce birationally isomorphic curves, even for $L_1=L_2$. We prove that any curve of genus $(q-1)^2$ whose $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_q$-automorphism group contains an elementary abelian subgroup of order $q^2$ is birationally equivalent to $\mathcal{X}_{(L_1, L_2)}$ for some separable $\bar{q}$-linearized polynomials $L_1,L_2$ of degree $q$. We produce an analogous characterization in the special case $L_1=L_2$. This extends a result on the Artin-Mumford curves, due to Arakelian and Korchm\'aros. ";Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)

The first formula was inspired by the work of Hausel, Letellier, and Rodriguez-Villegas. It provides a new approach for counting absolutely indecomposable quiver representations, vector bundles with parabolic structure on a projective curve, and irreducible etale local systems (via a result of Deligne). Our second formula resembles formulas appearing in the theory of Donaldson-Thomas invariants. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01960;Characterization of Kollár surfaces; Giancarlo Urzúa,  José Ignacio Yáñez;  Koll\'ar introduced in [Ko08] the surfaces $$(x_1^{a_1}x_2+x_2^{a_2}x_3+x_3^{a_3}x_4+x_4^{a_4}x_1=0)\subset \mathbb{P}(w_1,w_2,w_3,w_4)$$ where $w_i=W_i/w^*$, $W_i=a_{i+1}a_{i+2}a_{i+3}-a_{i+2}a_{i+3}+a_{i+3}-1$, and $w^*=$gcd$(W_1,\ldots,W_4)$. The aim was to give many interesting examples of $\mathbb{Q}$-homology projective planes. They occur when $w^*=1$. For that case, we prove that Koll\'ar surfaces are Hwang-Keum [HK12] surfaces. For $w^*>1$, we construct a geometrically explicit birational map between Koll\'ar surfaces and cyclic covers $z^{w^*}=l_1^{a_2 a_3 a_4} l_2^{-a_3 a_4} l_3^{a_4} l_4^{-1}$, where $\{l_1,l_2,l_3,l_4\}$ are four general lines in $\mathbb{P}^2$. In addition, by using various properties on classical Dedekind sums, we prove that: (a) For any $w^*>1$, we have $p_g=0$ iff the Koll\'ar surface is rational. This happens when $a_{i+1} \equiv 1$ or $a_{i}a_{i+1} \equiv -1 ($mod $w^*)$ for some $i$. (b) For any $w^*>1$, we have $p_g=1$ iff the Koll\'ar surface is birational to a K3 surface. We classify this situation. (c) For $w^*>>0$, we have that the smooth minimal model $S$ of a generic Koll\'ar surface is of general type with $K_{S}^2/e(S) \to 1$. ;"Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Number Theory (math.NT)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.02508;Action of the mapping class group on character varieties and Higgs  bundles; Oscar Garcia-Prada,  Graeme Wilkin;"  We consider the action of the orientation preserving mapping class group $Mod^+(S)$ of an oriented compact surface $S$ of genus $g \geq 2$ on the moduli space $\mathcal{R}(S,G)$ of representations of $\pi_1(S)$ in a connected semisimple real Lie group $G$. We identify the fixed points of the action of a finite subgroup $\Gamma \subset Mod^+(S)$ on $\mathcal{R}(S,G)$, in terms of $G$-Higgs bundles equipped with a $\Gamma$-pseudoequivariant structure on a Riemann surface $X=(S,J)$, where $J$ is an element in the Teichm\""uller space of $S$ for which $\Gamma \subset Aut(X)$, whose existence is guaranteed by Kerckhoff's solution of the Nielsen realization problem. The $\Gamma$-equivariant $G$-Higgs bundles are in turn in correspondence with parabolic Higgs bundles on $Y=X/\Gamma$, where the weights on the parabolic points are determined by the $\Gamma$-equivariant structure. This generalizes work of Nasatyr \& Steer for $G=SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ and Boden, Andersen & Grove and Furuta & Steer for $G=SU(n)$.

The main technical advance is to use torsion pairs as an efficient mechanism to track various objects under iterations of the flop functor (respectively, mutation functor). This allows us to relate compositions of the flop functor (respectively, mutation functor) to the theory of Deligne normal form, and to give a criterion for when a finite composition of $3$-fold flops can be understood as a tilt at a single torsion pair. We also use this technique to give a simplified proof of the result of Brav-Thomas for Kleinian singularities. ;"Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Algebraic Topology (math.AT); Representation Theory (math.RT)"

For any $q>1$, we give an exact formula for the $q$-weight of an affine branch point. We also find a formula for the $q$-weight of a point at infinity in the case where $n$ and $d$ are relatively prime. With these formulas, for any fixed $n$, we obtain an asymptotic formula for the ratio of the $q$-weight of the branch points, denoted $BW_q$, to the total $q$-weight of points on the curve: \[ \liminf_{d\to\infty}\frac{BW_q}{g(g-1)^2(2q-1)^2}\geq \frac{n+1}{3(n-1)^2(2q-1)^2},\] with equality when the limit is taken such that $\gcd(n,d)=1$. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)

The goal of this paper is to prove that a similar statement holds when one replaces linear subspaces with algebraic subschemes of the projective space. We exhibit equations of degree 1 and 2 that define schematically the Hilbert schemes $\mathbf{Hilb}^{p}_{\mathbb P^n}$ for all (possibly nonconstant) Hilbert polynomials $p$. The equations are reminiscent of the Pl\""ucker relations on the Grassmannians: they are built formally with permutations on indexes on the Pl\""ucker coordinates. Our method relies on a new construction of the Hilbert scheme as a quotient of a scheme of quiver representations. ";"Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Commutative Algebra (math.AC)"

Assuming zero expected dimension of this space, the de Jonqui\`eres formulas compute the virtual number of de Jonqui\`eres divisors.

The criterion in question is the existence of a Cartan subalgebra bundle of the endomorphism bundle $\text{End}(E)$. As a corollary, a criterion is obtained for $E$ to be the direct image of the structure sheaf under an \'etale morphism.

We prove these results in the case that the Lagrangian is smooth (hence is the conormal bundle to a subGrassmannian). To compute the pushforward to a point, or equivalently to the affinization, we simultaneously degenerate the Lagrangian and sheaf (over the affinization); the sheaf degenerates to a direct sum of cyclic modules over the geometric components, which are in bijection with plane partitions, giving a geometric interpretation to the Razumov-Stroganov correspondence satisfied by the loop model.

This will be obtained geometrically as follows. For every integer $g\ge 1$, we construct a moduli stack $\mathcal{B}_g$ over $\mathbf{Z}$ classifying principally polarized abelian varieties of dimension $g$ equipped with a suitable additional structure: a symplectic-Hodge basis of its first algebraic de Rham cohomology. We prove that $\mathcal{B}_g$ is a smooth Deligne-Mumford stack over $\mathbf{Z}$ of relative dimension $2g^2 + g$ and that $\mathcal{B}_g\otimes \mathbf{Z}[1/2]$ is representable by a smooth quasi-projective scheme over $\mathbf{Z}[1/2]$. Our main result is a description of the tangent bundle $T_{\mathcal{B}_g/\mathbf{Z}}$ in terms of the cohomology of the universal abelian scheme over the moduli stack of principally polarized abelian varieties $\mathcal{A}_g$. We derive from this description a family of $g(g+1)/2$ commuting vector fields $(v_{ij})_{1\le i \le j \le g}$ on $\mathcal{B}_g$; these are the higher Ramanujan vector fields. In the case $g=1$, we show that $v_{11}$ coincides with the vector field associated to the classical Ramanujan equations. This geometric framework taking account of integrality issues is mainly motivated by questions in transcendental number theory. In the upcoming second part of this work, we shall relate the values of a particular analytic solution to the differential equations defined by $v_{ij}$ with Grothendieck's periods conjecture on abelian varieties.

We introduce the tropical Chow hypersurface $\operatorname{Trop}(Z_X)$.

It has been an interesting question to find an intrinsic smoothness criteria for the complex Plateau problem. For $n\ge 3$ and $N=n+1$, Yau found a necessary and sufficient condition for the interior regularity of the Harvey-Lawson solution to the complex Plateau problem by means of Kohn--Rossi cohomology groups on $X$ in 1981. For $n=2$ and $N\ge n+1$, the first and third authors introduced a new CR invariant $g^{(1,1)}(X)$ of $X$. The vanishing of this invariant will give the interior regularity of the Harvey-Lawson solution up to normalization. For $n\ge 3$ and $N>n+1$, the problem still remains open. In this paper, we generalize the invariant $g^{(1,1)}(X)$ to higher dimension as $g^{(\Lambda^n 1)}(X)$ and show that if $g^{(\Lambda^n 1)}(X)=0$, then the interior has at most finite number of rational singularities. In particular, if $X$ is Calabi--Yau of real dimension $5$, then the vanishing of this invariant is equivalent to give the interior regularity up to normalization. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)

In particular, we show that if the canonical divisor $K_X$ defines an abelian cover over $\mathbb{P}^n$, i.e., when $X$ is an \emph{abelian canonical $n$-fold}, then the canonical degree of $X$ is universally upper bounded by a constant which only depends on $n$ for $X$ non-singular. We also construct two examples of non-singular minimal projective $4$-folds of general type with canonical degrees $81$ and $128$. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)

Zinn-Justin;  This is a review/announcement of results concerning the connection between certain exactly solvable two-dimensional models of statistical mechanics, namely loop models, and the equivariant $K$-theory of the cotangent bundle of the Grassmannian. We interpret various concepts from integrable systems ($R$-matrix, partition function on a finite domain) in geometric terms. As a byproduct, we provide explicit formulae for $K$-classes of various coherent sheaves, including structure and (conjecturally) square roots of canonical sheaves and canonical sheaves of conormal varieties of Schubert varieties. ;"Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Combinatorics (math.CO)"

The first part of this paper investigates under which conditions it is the analytic germification of an algebraic isomonodromic deformation. Up to some minor technical conditions, this turns out to be the case if and only if the monodromy of the connection has finite orbit under the action of the mapping class group. The second part of this paper studies the dynamics of this action in the particular case of reducible rank 2 representations and genus g > 0, allowing to classify all finite orbits. Both of these results extend recent ones concerning the genus 0 case. ;"Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Complex Variables (math.CV); Geometric Topology (math.GT)"

Also, we show that Cenkl's algorithm for non-expected dimensional singularities holds dropping the Cenkl's regularity assumption. ;"Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Algebraic Topology (math.AT); Complex Variables (math.CV); Differential Geometry (math.DG); Dynamical Systems (math.DS)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05912;The Geometry of the Artin-Schreier-Mumford Curves over an Algebraically  Closed Field; Gábor Korchmáros,  Maria Montanucci;  For a power $q$ of a prime $p$, the Artin-Schreier-Mumford curve $ASM(q)$ of genus $g=(q-1)^2$ is the nonsingular model $\mathcal{X}$ of the irreducible plane curve with affine equation $(X^q+X)(Y^q+Y)=c,\, c\neq 0,$ defined over a field $\mathbb{K}$ of characteristic $p$. The Artin-Schreier-Mumford curves are known from the study of algebraic curves defined over a non-Archimedean valuated field since for $|c|<1$ they are curves with a large solvable automorphism group of order $2(q-1)q^2 =2\sqrt{g}(\sqrt{g}+1)^2$, far away from the Hurwitz bound $84(g-1)$ valid in zero characteristic. In this paper we deal with the case where $\mathbb{K}$ is an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p$. We prove that the group $Aut(\mathcal{X})$ of all automorphisms of $\mathcal{X}$ fixing $\mathbb{K}$ elementwise has order $2q^2(q-1)$ and it is the semidirect product $Q\rtimes D_{q-1}$ where $Q$ is an elementary abelian group of order $q^2$ and $D_{q-1}$ is a dihedral group of order $2(q-1)$. For the special case $q=p$, this result was proven by Valentini and Madan. Furthermore, we show that $ASM(q)$ has a nonsingular model $\mathcal{Y}$ in the three-dimensional projective space $PG(3,\mathbb{K})$ which is neither classical nor Frobenius classical over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05997;On the absolute irreducibility of hyperplane sections of generalized  Fermat varieties in $\Bbb{P}^3$ and the conjecture on exceptional APN  functions: the Kasami-Welch degree case; Moises Delgado,  Heeralal Janwa;  Let $f$ be a function on a finite field $F$. The decomposition of the generalized Fermat variety $X$ defined by the multivariate polynomial of degree $n$, $\phi(x,y,z)=f(x)+f(y)+f(z)$ in $\Bbb{P}^3(\overline{\mathbb{F}}_2)$, plays a crucial role in the study of almost perfect non-linear (APN) functions and exceptional APN functions. Their structure depends fundamentally on the Fermat varieties corresponding to the monomial functions of exceptional degrees $n=2^k+1$ and $n=2^{2k}-2^k+1$ (Gold and Kasami-Welch numbers, respectively). Very important results for these have been obtained by Janwa, McGuire and Wilson in [12,13]. In this paper we study $X$ related to the Kasami-Welch degree monomials and its decomposition into absolutely irreducible components. We show that, in this decomposition, the components intersect transversally at a singular point. This structural fact implies that the corresponding generalized Fermat hypersurfaces, related to Kasami-Welch degree polynomial families, are absolutely irreducible. In particular, we prove that if $f(x)=x^{2^{2k}-2^k+1}+h(x)$, where ${\rm deg}(h)\equiv 3{\pmod 4}$, then the corresponding APN multivariate hypersurface is absolutely irreducible, and hence $f(x)$ is not exceptional APN function. We also prove conditional result in the case when ${\rm deg}(h)\equiv 5{\pmod 8}$. Since for odd degree $f(x)$, the conjecture needs to be resolved only for the Gold degree and the Kasami-Welch degree cases our results contribute substantially to the proof of the conjecture on exceptional APN functions---in the hardest case: the Kasami-Welch degree. ;"Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Cryptography and Security (cs.CR); Information Theory (cs.IT); Combinatorics (math.CO); Number Theory (math.NT)"

We show that if $Q$ satisfies some (strong) conditions then the space of stability conditions $Stab(A(Q))$ supported on this heart admits a natural family of semisimple Frobenius manifold structures, constructed using the invariants counting semistable objects in $D(Q)$. In the case of $A_n$ evaluating the family at a special point we recover a branch of the Saito Frobenius structure of the $A_n$ singularity $y^2 = x^{n+1}$. We give examples where applying the construction to each mutation of $Q$ and evaluating the families at a special point yields a different branch of the maximal analytic continuation of the same semisimple Frobenius manifold. In particular we check that this holds in the case of $A_n$, $n \leq 5$. ;"Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Differential Geometry (math.DG)"

Specifically we give a formula for the Dolbeault version of the $L^2$ pushforward in terms of a modification of the Dolbeault complex of a Higgs bundle which takes into account the monodromy weight filtration in the normal directions of the horizontal parabolic divisor. The parabolic structure of the higher direct image is obtained by analyzing the V -filtration at a normal crossings point. We prove this algebraic formula for semistable families of curves. ;"Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Differential Geometry (math.DG)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.06810;Automorphism groups of pseudoreal Riemann surfaces; Michela Artebani,  Saúl Quispe,  Cristian Reyes;  A smooth complex projective curve is called pseudoreal if it is isomorphic to its conjugate but is not definable over the reals. Such curves, together with real Riemann surfaces, form the real locus of the moduli space $\mathcal M_g$. This paper deals with the classification of pseudoreal curves according to the structure of their automorphism group. We follow two different approaches existing in the literature: one coming from number theory, dealing more generally with fields of moduli of projective curves, and the other from complex geometry, through the theory of NEC groups. Using the first approach, we prove that the automorphism group of a pseudoreal Riemann surface $X$ is abelian if $X/Z({\rm Aut}(X))$ has genus zero, where $Z({\rm Aut}(X))$ is the center of ${\rm Aut}(X)$. This includes the case of $p$-gonal Riemann surfaces, already known by results of Huggins and Kontogeorgis. By means of the second approach and of elementary properties of group extensions, we show that $X$ is not pseudoreal if the center of $G={\rm Aut}(X)$ is trivial and either ${\rm Out}(G)$ contains no involutions or ${\rm Inn}(G)$ has a group complement in ${\rm Aut}(G)$. This extends and gives an elementary proof (over $\mathbb C$) of a result by D\`ebes and Emsalem. Finally, we provide an algorithm, implemented in MAGMA, which classifies the automorphism groups of pseudoreal Riemann surfaces of genus $g\geq 2$, once a list of all groups acting for such genus, with their signature and generating vectors, are given. This program, together with the database provided by J. Paulhus in \cite{Pau15}, allowed us to classifiy pseudoreal Riemann surfaces up to genus $10$, extending previous results by Bujalance, Conder and Costa. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.06893;Probabilistic Schubert Calculus; Peter Bürgisser,  Antonio Lerario;  We initiate the study of average intersection theory in real Grassmannians. We define the expected degree $\textrm{edeg} G(k,n)$ of the real Grassmannian $G(k,n)$ as the average number of real $k$-planes meeting nontrivially $k(n-k)$ random subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^n$, all of dimension $n-k$, where these subspaces are sampled uniformly and independently from $G(n-k,n)$. We express $\textrm{edeg} G(k,n)$ in terms of the volume of an invariant convex body in the tangent space to the Grassmanian, and prove an explicit upper bound for it that is asymptotically sharp for $n\to\infty$ (in the logarithmic scale). Moreover, we show the asymptotic square root law $$ \textrm{edeg} G(k,n) = \textrm{deg} G_\mathbb{C}(k,n)^{\frac{1}{2} +o(1)} \quad\mbox{for $k,n\to\infty$},$$ where $\textrm{deg} G_\mathbb{C}(k,n)$ denotes the degree of the corresponding complex Grassmannian. In the case of the Grassmannian of lines, we prove the finer asymptotic \begin{equation*} \textrm{edeg} G(2,n+1) = \frac{8}{3\pi^{5/2}\sqrt{n}}\, \left(\frac{\pi^2}{4} \right)^n \left(1+\mathcal{O}(n^{-1})\right). \end{equation*} The expected degree turns out to be the key quantity governing questions of the random enumerative geometry of flats. We associate with a semialgebraic set $X\subseteq\mathbb{R}\textrm{P}^{n-1}$ of dimension $n-k-1$ its Chow hypersurface $Z(X)\subseteq G(k,n)$, consisting of the $k$-planes $A$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ whose projectivization intersects $X$. Denoting $N:=k(n-k)$, we show that $$ \mathbb{E}\#\left(g_1Z(X_1)\cap\cdots\cap g_N Z(X_N)\right) = \textrm{edeg} G(k,n) \cdot \prod_{i=1}^{N} \frac{|X_i|}{|\mathbb{R}\textrm{P}^{m}|}, $$ where each $X_i$ is of dimension $m=n-k-1$, the expectation is taken with respect to independent uniformly distributed $g_1,\ldots,g_m\in O(n)$ and $|X_i|$ denotes the $m$-dimensional volume of $X_i$. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)

On the other hand, the period map of the GIT moduli space of quartic surfaces is significantly more subtle. In our previous paper we introduced a Hassett-Keel-Looijenga program for certain locally symmetric varieties of Type IV. As a consequence, we gave a complete conjectural decomposition into a product of elementary birational modifications of the period map for the GIT moduli spaces of quartic surfaces and of double covers of smooth quadrics branched over a (4,4) curve. The purpose of this note is to provide compelling evidence in favor of our program. Specifically, we propose a matching between the arithmetic strata in the period space and suitable strata of the GIT moduli spaces of quartic surfaces and of double covers of smooth quadrics. We then partially verify that the proposed matching actually holds. In the case of quartic surfaces we do this ""by hand"" for some of the strata. In the case of double covers of quadrics, we set up a VGIT which provides a one-to-one correspondence between the conjectural Mori chamber decomposition for the period space and the chamber decomposition for the moduli space of double covers coming from variation of the polarization defining (semi)stability. We prove that the correspondence holds for half of the chambers, while for the other half further work is required. ";Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)

In place of twistor lines, Verbitsky's work on ergodic complex structures provides the essential global input. On the one hand, our deformation theoretic results are a further generalization of Huybrechts' theorem on deformation equivalence of birational hyperk\""ahler manifolds to the context of singular symplectic varieties. On the other hand, our global moduli theory provides a framework for understanding and classifying the symplectic singularities that arise from birational contractions of irreducible symplectic manifolds, and there are a number of applications to $K3^{[n]}$-type varieties.

We study the moduli of real decompositions, so-called Space of Sums of Powers, naturally included in the Variety of Sums of Powers.

Further, we study the locus of general real forms whose real rank coincides with the complex rank. In case of quaternary quadrics the boundary of this locus is a degree forty hypersurface $J(\sigma_3(v_3(\mathbb{P}^3)),\tau(v_3(\mathbb{P}^3)))$. ;"Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Commutative Algebra (math.AC)"

In an appendix, we construct a K-theoretic Euler class for even-rank vector bundles with quadratic form, refining the Chow-theoretic class introduced by Edidin and Graham.

Let $E$ be a rational $GL_n(k)$-bundle on $X$, and $\rho:GL_n(k)\rightarrow GL_m(k)$ a rational $GL_n(k)$-representation at most degree $d$ such that $\rho$ maps the radical $R(GL_n(k))$ of $GL_n(k)$ into the radical $R(GL_m(k))$ of $GL_m(k)$. We show that if $F_X^{N*}(E)$ is semistable for some integer $N\geq\max\limits_{0<r<m}C^r_m\cdot\log_p(dr)$, then the induced rational $GL_m(k)$-bundle $E(GL_m(k))$ is semistable.

The cohomological data of these spaces can be found by counting their numbers of points over finite fields. The trigonal curves of genus five can be represented by projective plane quintics that have one singularity, which is of delta-invariant one. We use a partial sieve method for plane curves to count the number of trigonal curves over any finite field. The result agrees with the findings of a computer program we have written that counts the number of trigonal curves over the finite fields of two and three elements. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)

We associate with these components and with their codimensions and embedding dimensions, a weighted graph. We prove that the data of this weighted graph is equivalent to the data of the topological type of the singularity. We also determine a component of the jet schemes (or equivalently, a divisor on $\mathbb{A}^3$), that computes the log canonical threshold of the singularity embedded in $\mathbb{A}^3$. This provides us with pairs $X\subset\mathbb{A}^3$ whose log canonical thresholds are not contributed by monomial divisorial valuations. Note that for a pair $C\subset\mathbb{A}^2$, where $C$ is a plane curve, the log canonical threshold is always contributed by a monomial divisorial valuation (in suitable coordinates of $\mathbb{A}^2$). ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)

Each conical point (or a conjugacy class of primitive elliptic elements in the Fuchsian group) gives rise to an extra term in the local index theorem that is proportional to the symplectic form of a new K\""{a}hler metric on the moduli space of Riemann orbisurfaces. We find a simple formula for a local K\""{a}hler potential of the elliptic metric and show that when the order of elliptic element becomes large, the elliptic metric converges to the cuspidal one corresponding to a puncture on the orbisurface (or a conjugacy class of primitive parabolic elements).

In particular, we provide explicit equations defining the Kummer variety $\mathcal K$ as a subvariety of $\mathbb P^7$, together with explicit polynomials giving the duplication map on $\mathcal K$. A careful study of the degenerations of this map then forms the basis for the development of an explicit theory of heights on such Jacobians when $k$ is a number field. We use this input to obtain a good bound on the difference between naive and canonical height, which is a necessary ingredient for the explicit determination of the Mordell-Weil group. We illustrate our results with two examples. ;"Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Number Theory (math.NT)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01074;The role of defect and splitting in finite generation of extensions of  associated graded rings along a valuation; Steven Dale Cutkosky;  Suppose that $R$ is a 2 dimensional excellent local domain with quotient field $K$, $K^*$ is a finite separable extension of $K$ and $S$ is a 2 dimensional local domain with quotient field $K^*$ such that $S$ dominates $R$. Suppose that $\nu^*$ is a valuation of $K^*$ such that $\nu^*$ dominates $S$. Let $\nu$ be the restriction of $\nu^*$ to $K$. The associated graded ring ${\rm gr}_{\nu}(R)$ was introduced by Bernard Teissier. It plays an important role in local uniformization. We show that the extension $(K,\nu)\rightarrow (K^*,\nu^*)$ of valued fields is without defect if and only if there exist regular local rings $R_1$ and $S_1$ such that $R_1$ is a local ring of a blow up of $R$, $S_1$ is a local ring of a blowup of $S$, $\nu^*$ dominates $S_1$, $S_1$ dominates $R_1$ and the associated graded ring ${\rm gr}_{\nu^*}(S_1)$ is a finitely generated ${\rm gr}_{\nu}(R_1)$-algebra. We also investigate the role of splitting of the valuation $\nu$ in $K^*$ in finite generation of the extensions of associated graded rings along the valuation. We will say that $\nu$ does not split in $S$ if $\nu^*$ is the unique extension of $\nu$ to $K^*$ which dominates $S$. We show that if $R$ and $S$ are regular local rings, $\nu^*$ has rational rank 1 and is not discrete and ${\rm gr}_{\nu^*}(S)$ is a finitely generated ${\rm gr}_{\nu}(R)$-algebra, then $\nu$ does not split in $S$. We give examples showing that such a strong statement is not true when $\nu$ does not satisfy these assumptions. We deduce that if $\nu$ has rational rank 1 and is not discrete and if $R\rightarrow R'$ is a nontrivial sequence of quadratic transforms along $\nu$, then ${\rm gr}_{\nu}(R')$ is not a finitely generated ${\rm gr}_{\nu}(R)$-algebra. ;"Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Commutative Algebra (math.AC)"

Some results generalise known facts about $X = A^n$ with diagonal $G$-action, while other results are new also in this basic case.

Further, for a smooth, projective variety X of dimension n>1, we show that g_n acts infinitesimally on the derived moduli space RBun_G(X,x) of G-bundles over X trivialized at the formal neighborhood of a point x of X. Finally, for a representation \phi: G-->GL_r, we construct an associated determinantal line bundle on RBun_G(X,x) and prove that the action of g_n extends to an action of g_{n,P_\phi} on such bundle for P_\phi the (n+1)-st Chern character of \phi. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)

This generalises the classical morphism to the linear series of a basepoint-free line bundle on a scheme. We describe the image of the morphism and present necessary and sufficient conditions for surjectivity in terms of a recollement of a module category. When the morphism is surjective, this gives a fine moduli space interpretation of the image, and as an application we show that for a small, finite subgroup $G\subset \text{GL}(2,k)$, every sub-minimal partial resolution of $\mathbb{A}^2_k/G$ is isomorphic to a fine moduli space $\mathcal{M}(E_C)$ where $E_C$ is a summand of the bundle $E$ defining the reconstruction algebra.

It allows us to construct many examples of pairs $(\mathcal{V},S(\mathcal{V}))$ by perturbing nodal curves. ";Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01807;Matrix divisors on Riemann surfaces and Lax operator algebras; Oleg K. Sheinman;  Matrix divisors are introduced in the work by A.Weil (1938) which is considered as a starting point of the theory of holomorphic vector bundles on Riemann surfaces. In this theory matrix divisors play the role similar to the role of usual divisors in the theory of line bundles. Moreover, they provide explicit coordinates (Tyurin parameters) in an open subset of the moduli space of stable vector bundles. These coordinates turned out to be helpful in integration of soliton equations. We would like to gain attention to one more relationship between matrix divisors of vector G-bundles (where G is a complex semi-simple Lie group) and the theory of integrable systems, namely to the relationship with Lax operator algebras. The result we obtain can be briefly formulated as follows: the moduli space of matrix divisors with certain discrete invariants and fixed support is a homogeneous space. Its tangent space at the unit is naturally isomorphic to the quotient space of M-operators by L-operators, both spaces essentially defined by the same invariants (the result goes back to Krichever, 2001). We give one more description of the same space in terms of root systems. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)

Mamedova;  For a G-invariant holomorphic 1-form with an isolated singular point on a germ of a complex-analytic G-variety with an isolated singular point (G is a finite group) one has notions of the equivariant homological index and of the (reduced) equivariant radial index as elements of the ring of complex representations of the group. We show that on a germ of a smooth complex-analytic G-variety these indices coincide. This permits to consider the difference between them as a version of the equivariant Milnor number of a germ a G-variety with an isolated singular point. ;"Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Geometric Topology (math.GT)"

Eggermont,  Andrew Snowden;  Let $P_3(\mathbf{C}^{\infty})$ be the space of complex cubic polynomials in infinitely many variables. We show that this space is $\mathbf{GL}_{\infty}$-noetherian, meaning that any $\mathbf{GL}_{\infty}$-stable Zariski closed subset is cut out by finitely many orbits of equations. Our method relies on a careful analysis of an invariant of cubics introduced here called q-rank. This result is motivated by recent work in representation stability, especially the theory of twisted commutative algebras. It is also connected to certain stability problems in commutative algebra, such as Stillman's conjecture. ;"Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Commutative Algebra (math.AC)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01898;Monodromy and Vinberg fusion for the principal degeneration of the space  of G-bundles; Simon Schieder;"  We study the geometry and the singularities of the principal direction of the Drinfeld-Lafforgue-Vinberg degeneration of the moduli space of G-bundles Bun_G for an arbitrary reductive group G, and their relationship to the Langlands dual group of G. The article consists of two parts. In the first and main part, we study the monodromy action on the nearby cycles sheaf along the principal degeneration of Bun_G and relate it to the Langlands dual group of G. We determine the weight-monodromy filtration on the nearby cycles, generalizing the results of [Sch1] from the case G=SL_2 to the case of an arbitrary reductive group G: Our description is given in terms of the combinatorics of the Langlands dual group of G and generalizations of the Picard-Lefschetz oscillators found in [Sch1]. Our proofs in the first part use certain local models for the principal degeneration of Bun_G whose geometry may be of independent interest and is studied in the second part. Our local models simultaneously provide two types of degenerations of the Zastava spaces; these degenerations are of very different nature, and together equip the Zastava spaces with the geometric analog of a Hopf algebra structure. The first degeneration corresponds to the usual Beilinson-Drinfeld fusion of divisors on the curve. The second degeneration is new and corresponds to what one might call Vinberg fusion: It is obtained not by degenerating divisors on the curve, but by degenerating the group G via the Vinberg semigroup. Furthermore, on the level of cohomology the degeneration corresponding to the Vinberg fusion gives rise to an algebra structure, while the degeneration corresponding to the Beilinson-Drinfeld fusion gives rise to a coalgebra structure; the compatibility between the two degenerations yields the Hopf algebra axiom.

We prove that maximal $S$-homogeneous toric varieties are in bijection with pairs $(P,\mathcal{A})$, where $P$ is an abelian group and $\mathcal{A}$ is a finite collection of elements in $P$ such that $\mathcal{A}$ generates the group $P$ and for every $a\in\mathcal{A}$ the element $a$ is contained in the semigroup generated by $\mathcal{A}\setminus\{a\}$. We show that any non-degenerate homogeneous toric variety is a big open toric subset of a maximal $S$-homogeneous toric variety. In particular, every homogeneous toric variety is quasiprojective. We conjecture that any non-degenerate homogeneous toric variety is $S$-homogeneous. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)

Our results are based on previous results on stable reduction of superelliptic curves that allow to compute the conductor exponent $f_p$ at the primes $p$ of bad reduction. A careful analysis of the possibilities of the stable reduction at $p$ yields restrictions on the conductor exponent $f_p$. We prove that Picard curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ always have bad reduction at $p=3$, with $f_3\geq 4$. As an application we discuss the question of finding Picard curves with small conductor. ;"Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Number Theory (math.NT)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02176;On the tensor semigroup of affine kac-moody lie algebras; Nicolas Ressayre (ICJ);  In this paper, we are interested in the decomposition of the tensor product of two representations of a symmetrizable Kac-Moody Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$. Let $P\_+$ be the set of dominant integral weights. For $\lambda\in P\_+$ , $L(\lambda)$ denotes the irreducible, integrable, highest weight representation of g with highest weight $\lambda$. Let $P\_{+,\mathbb Q}$ be the rational convex cone generated by $P\_+$. Consider the tensor cone $\Gamma(\mathfrak g) := \{(\lambda\_1 ,\lambda\_2, \mu) $\in$ P\_{+,\mathbb Q}^3\,| \exists N \textgreater{} 1 L(N\mu) \subset L(N \lambda\_1)\otimes L(N \lambda\_2)\}$. If $\mathfrak g$ is finite dimensional, $\Gamma(\mathfrak g)$ is a polyhedral convex cone described in 2006 by Belkale-Kumar by an explicit finite list of inequalities. In general, $\Gamma(\mathfrak g)$ is nor polyhedral, nor closed. In this article we describe the closure of $\Gamma(\mathfrak g)$ by an explicit countable family of linear inequalities, when $\mathfrak g$ is untwisted affine. This solves a Brown-Kumar's conjecture in this case. We also obtain explicit saturation factors for the semigroup of triples $(\lambda\_1, \lambda\_2 , \mu) $\in$ P\_+^3$ such that $L(\mu) $\subset$ L(\lambda\_1) \otimes L(\lambda\_2)$. Note that even the existence of such saturation factors is not obvious since the semigroup is not finitely generated. For example, in type $A , we prove that any integer $d\geq 2$ is a saturation factor, generalizing the case ${\tilde A}\_1$ shown by Brown-Kumar. ;"Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Representation Theory (math.RT)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02186;Transcendency Degree One Function Fields Over a Finite Field with Many  Automorphisms; Gábor Korchmáros,  Maria Montanucci,  Pietro Speziali;"  Let $\mathbb{K}$ be the algebraic closure of a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ of odd characteristic $p$. For a positive integer $m$ prime to $p$, let $F=\mathbb{K}(x,y)$ be the transcendency degree $1$ function field defined by $y^q+y=x^m+x^{-m}$. Let $t=x^{m(q-1)}$ and $H=\mathbb{K}(t)$. The extension $F|H$ is a non-Galois extension. Let $K$ be the Galois closure of $F$ with respect to $H$. By a result of Stichtenoth, $K$ has genus $g(K)=(qm-1)(q-1)$, $p$-rank (Hasse-Witt invariant) $\gamma(K)=(q-1)^2$ and a $\mathbb{K}$-automorphism group of order at least $2q^2m(q-1)$. In this paper we prove that this subgroup is the full $\mathbb{K}$-automorphism group of $K$; more precisely $Aut_{\mathbb {K}}(K)=Q\rtimes D$ where $Q$ is an elementary abelian $p$-group of order $q^2$ and $D$ has a index $2$ cyclic subgroup of order $m(q-1)$. In particular, $\sqrt{m}|Aut_{\mathbb{K}}(K)|> g(K)^{3/2}$, and if $K$ is ordinary (i.e. $g(K)=\gamma(K)$) then $|Aut_{\mathbb{K}}(K)|>g^{3/2}$. On the other hand, if $G$ is a solvable subgroup of the $\mathbb{K}$-automorphism group of an ordinary, transcendency degree $1$ function field $L$ of genus $g(L)\geq 2$ defined over $\mathbb{K}$, then by a result due to Korchm\'aros and Montanucci, $|Aut_{\mathbb{K}}(K)|\le 34 (g(L)+1)^{3/2}<68\sqrt{2}g(L)^{3/2}$. This shows that $K$ hits this bound up to the constant $68\sqrt{2}$. Since $Aut_{\mathbb{K}}(K)$ has several subgroups, the fixed subfield $F^N$ of such a subgroup $N$ may happen to have many automorphisms provided that the normalizer of $N$ in $Aut_{\mathbb{K}}(K)$ is large enough. This possibility is worked out for subgroups of $Q$. ";Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)

Secondly, we show that the two Swan classes in the literature are the same on proper smooth surfaces over a finite field. ;"Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Number Theory (math.NT)"

Assuming potential semi-stable reduction, we show how to correct this by proving that a K3 surface has good reduction if and only if $H^2_{\mathrm{\acute{e}t}}(X_{\overline{K}},\mathbb{Q}_\ell)$ is unramified, and the associated Galois representation over the residue field coincides with the second cohomology of a certain ""canonical reduction"" of $X$.

This is done by first tropicalizing the curve, and then computing the Jacobian of the resulting weighted metric graph. In general, it is not known how to find the abstract tropicalization of a curve defined by polynomial equations, since an embedded tropicalization may not be faithful, and there is no known algorithm for carrying out semistable reduction in practice. We solve this problem in the case of hyperelliptic curves by studying admissible covers. We also describe how to take a weighted metric graph and compute its period matrix, which gives its tropical Jacobian and tropical theta divisor. Lastly, we describe the present status of reversing this process, namely how to compute a curve which has a given matrix as its period matrix. ;"Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Combinatorics (math.CO)"

A surface $S$ in $\mathbb{P}^3$ defines the Hurwitz hypersurface in $\mathrm{Gr}(1,\mathbb{P}^3)$ of all lines which are tangent to $S$. We show that its singular locus has two components for general enough $S$: the congruence of bitangents and the congruence of inflectional tangents. We give new proofs for the bidegrees of the secant, bitangent and inflectional congruences, using geometric techniques such as duality, polar loci and projections.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.03925;Intersection theory of toric $b$-divisors in toric varieties; Ana María Botero;  We introduce toric $b$-divisors on complete smooth toric varieties and a notion of integrability of such divisors. We show that under some positivity assumptions toric $b$-divisors are integrable and that their degree is given as the volume of a convex set. Moreover, we show that the dimension of the space of global sections of a nef toric $b$-divisor is equal to the number of lattice points in this convex set and we give a Hilbert--Samuel type formula for its asymptotic growth. This generalizes classical results for classical toric divisors on toric varieties. Finally, we relate convex bodies associated to $b$-divisors with Newton--Okounkov bodies. The main motivation for studying toric $b$-divisors is that they locally encode the singularities of the invariant metric on an automorphic line bundle over a toroidal compactification of a mixed Shimura variety of non-compact type. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.03951;Connected components of real $CB_{n}$ algebraic varieties; N.C.Combe;  Connected components of real algebraic varieties invariant under the $CB_{n}$-Coxeter group are investigated. In particular, we consider their maximal number and their geometric and topological properties. This provides a decomposition for the space of $CB_{n}$-algebraic varieties. We construct $CB_{n}$-polynomials using Young-posets and partitions of integers. Our results establish bounds on the number of connected components for a given set of coefficients. It turns out that this number can achieve an upper bound of $2^{n}+1$ for specific coefficients. We introduce a new method to characterize the geometry of these real algebraic varieties, using J. Cerf and A. Douady theory for varieties with angular boundary and the theory of chambers and galleries. We provide several examples that bring out the essence of these results. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)

We show that the gradient ideal of a projective hypersurface is of linear type if and only if the corresponding affine curve in the affine chart associated to singular points is locally Eulerian.

The main result shows that the Betti numbers of parabolic Hessenberg varieties decompose into a combination of those of Springer fibers and Schubert varieties associated to the parabolic. As a corollary we show that the Betti numbers of some parabolic Hessenberg varieties in Lie type A are equal to those of a specific union of Schubert varieties.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04488;Remarks on the $\mathrm{CH}_2$ of cubic hypersurfaces; René Mboro;  This paper presents two approaches to reducing problems on $2$-cycles on a smooth cubic hypersurface $X$ over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $\neq 2$, to problems on $1$-cycles on its variety of lines $F(X)$. The first one relies on bitangent lines of $X$ and Tsen-Lang theorem. It allows to prove that $\mathrm{CH}_2(X)$ is generated, via the action of the universal $\mathbb P^1$-bundle over $F(X)$, by $\mathrm{CH}_1(F(X))$. When the characteristic of the base field is $0$, we use that result to prove that if $dim(X)\geq 7$, then $\mathrm{CH}_2(X)$ is generated by classes of planes contained in $X$ and if $dim(X)\geq 9$, then $\mathrm{CH}_2(X)\simeq \mathbb Z$. Similar results, with slightly weaker bounds, had already been obtained by Pan. The second approach consists of an extension to subvarieties of $X$ of higher dimension of an inversion formula developped by Shen in the case of curves of $X$. This inversion formula allows to lift torsion cycles in $\mathrm{CH}_2(X)$ to torsion cycles in $\mathrm{CH}_1(F(X))$. For complex cubic $5$-folds, it allows to prove that the birational invariant provided by the group $\mathrm{CH}^3(X)_{tors,AJ}$ of homologically trivial, torsion codimension $3$ cycles annihilated by the Abel-Jacobi morphism is controlled by the group $\mathrm{CH}_1(F(X))_{tors,AJ}$ which is a birational invariant of $F(X)$, possibly always trivial for Fano varieties. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)

But if the degree $d$ of the hypersurface is $\leq n$, the zeta function is trivial mod $p$ and the Hasse-Witt matrix is zero-by-zero.

We also describe the differential equations satisfied by this matrix and prove that it is generically invertible. ;"Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Number Theory (math.NT)"

The proof is elementary, using standard properties of the logarithmic de Rham-Witt complex. As a corollary, we deduce similar algebraicity lifting results for cohomology classes on varieties over global function fields. Finally, we give a counter example to show that the variational Tate conjecture for divisors cannot hold with $\mathbb{Q}_p$-coefficients. ;"Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Number Theory (math.NT)"

Our original application of this pairing was to answer a question on the Ceresa cycle posed by R. Hain and D. Reed. (This question has since been answered independently by Hain.) Here we apply the pairing to show that a certain analytic line bundle, called the biextension line bundle, defined in terms of normal functions, always extends to any smooth partial compactification of the base. We show that the the pairing on intersection cohomology governs the extension of the natural metric on this line bundle studied by Hain and Reed (as well as, more recently, by several other authors). We also prove a positivity property of the asypmtotic height pairing, which generalize results of a recent preprint of J. Burgos Gill, D.

Moreover, we show that the asymptotic height pairing arises in a natural way from certain Mumford-Grothendieck biextensions associated to normal functions. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)

If $X$ is special, in the sense of B.Hasset, and $F(X) \simeq S^{[2]}$, with $S$ a K3 surface associated to $X$, then we show that the Chow motive $h(X)$ contains as a direct summand a ""transcendental motive"" $t(X)$ such that $t(X)\simeq t_2(S)(1)$. The motive of $X$ is finite dimensional if and only if $S$ has a finite dimensional motive, in which case $t(X)$ is indecomposable.

We present a new algorithm to compute the low rank decomposition of the Hankel operator and the decomposition of its symbol exploiting the properties of the associated Artinian Gorenstein quotient algebra A\_$\sigma$.

The frequencies and the weights are deduced from the generalized eigenvectors of pencils of shifted sub-matrices of H $\sigma$. Explicit formula for the weights in terms of the eigenvectors avoid us to solve a Vandermonde system. This new method is a multivariate generalization of the so-called Pencil method for solving Prony-type decomposition problems. We analyse its numerical behaviour in the presence of noisy input moments, and describe a rescaling technique which improves the numerical quality of the reconstruction for frequencies of high amplitudes.

We derive formulas expressing the Hilbert series and multiplicity of Y at a cominuscule point in terms of the restrictions of classes in T-equivariant K-theory and cohomology to that point. Thus, we can calculate Hilbert series and multiplicities in cases where these were previously unknown. If X is of cominuscule type, then every T-fixed point in Y is cominuscule, and our formulas specialize to previously known formulas. The formulas for Schubert varieties are special cases of more general formulas valid at what we call generalized cominuscule points of schemes with torus actions. ;"Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Combinatorics (math.CO); Representation Theory (math.RT)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06579;Brill-Noether theory for curves of a fixed gonality; David Jensen,  Dhruv Ranganathan;  We prove a generalization of the Brill-Noether theorem for the variety of special divisors $W^r_d(C)$ on a general curve $C$ of prescribed gonality. Our main theorem gives a closed formula for the dimension of $W^r_d(C)$. We build on previous work of Pflueger, who used an analysis of the tropical divisor theory of special chains of cycles to give upper bounds on the dimensions of Brill--Noether varieties on such curves. We prove his conjecture, that this upper bound is achieved for a general curve. Our methods introduce logarithmic stable maps as a systematic tool in Brill-Noether theory. A precise relation between the divisor theory on chains of cycles and the corresponding tropical maps theory is exploited to prove new regeneration theorems for linear series with negative Brill-Noether number. The strategy involves blending an analysis of obstruction theories for logarithmic stable maps with the geometry of Berkovich curves. To show the utility of these methods, we provide a short new derivation of lifting for special divisors on a chain of cycles with generic edge lengths, proved using different techniques by Cartwright, Jensen, and Payne. A crucial technical result is a new realizability theorem for tropical stable maps in obstructed geometries, generalizing a well-known theorem of Speyer on genus one curves to arbitrary genus. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)

We use this approach to prove a purely elementary criterion for proving cases of the Maximal Rank Conjecture, and then apply the criterion to several ranges of cases, giving a new proof of the case of quadrics, and also treating several families in the case of cubics. Our proofs do not require restrictions on direction of approach, so we recover new information on the locus in the moduli space of curves on which the maximal rank condition fails. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06677;Twisted monodromy homomorphisms and Massey products; Andrei Pajitnov;"  Let $\phi: M\to M$ be a diffeomorphism of a $C^\infty$ compact connected manifold, and $X$ its mapping torus. There is a natural fibration $p:X\to S^1$, denote by $\xi\in H^1(X, \mathbb{Z})$ the corresponding cohomology class. Let $\rho:\pi_1(X)\to GL(n,\mathbb{C})$ be a representation, denote by $H^*(X,\rho)$ the corresponding twisted cohomology of $X$. Denote by $\rho_0$ the restriction of $\rho$ to $\pi_1(M)$, and by $\rho^*_0$ the antirepresentation conjugate to $\rho_0$. We construct from these data an automorphism of the group $H_*(M,\rho^*_0)$, that we call the twisted monodromy homomorphism $\phi_*$. The aim of the present work is to establish a relation between Massey products in $H^*(X,\rho)$ and Jordan blocks of $\phi_*$. Given a non-zero complex number $\lambda$ define a representation $\rho_\lambda:\pi_1(X)\to GL(n,\mathbb{C})$ as follows: $\rho_\lambda(g)=\lambda^{\xi(g)}\cdot\rho(g)$. Denote by $J_k(\phi_*, \lambda)$ the maximal size of a Jordan block of eigenvalue $\lambda$ of the automorphism $\phi_*$ in the homology of degree $k$. The main result of the paper says that $J_k(\phi_*, \lambda)$ is equal to the maximal length of a non-zero Massey product of the form $\langle \xi, \ldots , \xi, x\rangle$ where $x\in H^k(X,\rho)$ (here the length means the number of entries of $\xi$). In particular, $\phi_*$ is diagonalizable, if a suitable formality condition holds for the manifold $X$. This is the case if $X$ a compact K\""ahler manifold and $\rho$ is a semisimple representation. The proof of the main theorem is based on the fact that the above Massey products can be identified with differentials in a Massey spectral sequence, which in turn can be explicitly computed in terms of the Jordan normal form of $\phi_*$.

The importance of this generalization is, that it is closely related to Hilbert's 1888 theorem about tenary quartics. In fact, if such a generalization exits, then one can state a Hilbert-like theorem, where positivity is only demanded on some semi-algebraic set. We will show that such a generalization is not possible, at least not without additional conditions. To prove this, we will use and generalize certain tools developed by Netzer ([Ne]). These new tools will allow us to conclude that this generalization of the S-lemma is not possible because of geometric reasons. Furthermore, we are able to establish a link between geometric reasons and algebraic reasons. This will be accomplished within the framework of quadratic modules. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)

In order to reconstruct a scene from its picture under the different cameras it is important to be able to find the critical points of the function which measures the distance between a general point $u\in\mathbb{P}^{2N}$ and the multiview variety. In this paper we calculate a specific degree $3$ polynomial that computes the number of critical points as a function of $N$. In order to do this, we construct a resolution of the multiview variety, and use it to compute its Chern-Mather class. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)

The moduli map $\mathcal V\to \mathcal M_g$ of an irreducible component $\mathcal V$ of $\mathcal V_{m,\delta}$ is generically of maximal rank if and only if certain cohomology vanishings hold. Assuming there are suitable semistable degenerations of the surfaces in $\mathcal B$, we provide sufficient conditions for the existence of an irreducible component $\mathcal V$ where these vanishings are verified. As a test, we apply this to $K3$ surfaces and give a new proof of a result recently independently proved by Kemeny and by the present authors. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)

We also extend this result to strong approximation with Brauer-Manin obstruction for groupic varieties of which all invertible functions are constant. As a by-product of the fibration method, we provide an example which satisfies strong approximation with Brauer-Manin obstruction over $\mathbb{Q}$ and fails to satisfy such a property after some finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}$. We prove that any open subset $U$ of a semi-simple simply connected quasi-split linear algebraic group $G$ with ${codim} (G\setminus U, G)\geq 2$ over a number field satisfies strong approximation by establishing a fibration of $G$ over a toric variety. We also prove a similar result of strong approximation withBrauer-Manin obstruction for a partial equivariant smooth compactification of a homogeneous space where all invertible functions are constant and the semi-simple part of the linear algebraic group is quasi-split.

As one of the consequences of this, we prove that if $V_n$ is semistable in characteristic 0, then its reduction mod $p$ is strongly semistable, for $p$ in a Zariski dense set of primes. Moreover, for any given finitely many such semistable bundles $V_n$, there is a common Zariski dense set of such primes. ;"Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Commutative Algebra (math.AC)"

The space $\mathcal Q_0^{\mathbb R}(-7)$ is the moduli space of meromorphic quadratic differentials on the Riemann sphere with one pole of order 7 with real periods; it appears naturally in the study of a neighbourhood of the Witten's cycle $W_1$ in the combinatorial model based on Jenkins-Strebel quadratic differentials of $\mathcal M_{g,n}$. The space $\mathcal Q^{\mathbb R}_0([-3]^2)$ is the moduli space of meromorphic quadratic differentials on the Riemann sphere with two poles of order at most 3 with real periods; it appears in description of a neighbourhood of Kontsevich's boundary $W_{-1,-1}$ of the combinatorial model. The application of the formalism of the Bergman tau-function to the combinatorial model (with the goal of computing analytically Poincare dual cycles to certain combinations of tautological classes) requires the study of special sections of circle bundles over $\mathcal Q_0^{\mathbb R}(-7)$ and $\mathcal Q^{\mathbb R}_0([-3]^2)$; in the case of the space $\mathcal Q_0^{\mathbb R}(-7)$ a section of this circle bundle is given by the argument of the modular discriminant.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.00511;Interplay between opers, quantum curves, WKB analysis, and Higgs bundles; Olivia Dumitrescu,  Motohico Mulase;  Quantum curves were introduced in the physics literature. We develop a mathematical framework for the case associated with Hitchin spectral curves. In this context, a quantum curve is a Rees $\mathcal{D}$-module on a smooth projective algebraic curve, whose semi-classical limit produces the Hitchin spectral curve of a Higgs bundle. We give a method of quantization of Hitchin spectral curves by concretely constructing one-parameter deformation families of opers. We propose a generalization of the topological recursion of Eynard-Orantin and Mirzakhani for the context of singular Hitchin spectral curves. We show a surprising result that a PDE version of the topological recursion provides all-order WKB analysis for the Rees $\mathcal{D}$-modules, defined as the quantization of Hitchin spectral curves associated with meromorphic $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$-Higgs bundles. Topological recursion is thus identified as a process of quantization of Hitchin spectral curves. We prove that these two quantizations, one via the construction of families of opers, and the other via the PDE topological recursion, agree for holomorphic and meromorphic $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$-Higgs bundles. Classical differential equations such as the Airy differential equation provides a typical example. Through these classical examples, we see that quantum curves relate Higgs bundles, opers, a conjecture of Gaiotto, and quantum invariants, such as Gromov-Witten invariants. ;"Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01173;Characterization of $n$-dimensional normal affine $SL_n$ -varieties; Andriy Regeta;  We show that any normal irreducible affine $n$-dimensional $SL_n$-variety $X$ is determined by its automorphism group in the category of normal irreducible affine varieties: if $Y$ is an irreducible affine normal algebraic variety such that $Aut(X) \cong Aut(Y)$ as ind-groups, then $Y \cong X$ as varieties. If we drop the condition of normality on $Y$ , then $X$ is not uniquely determined and we classify all such varieties. In case $n \ge 3$, all the above results hold true if we replace $Aut(X)$ by $U(X)$, where $U(X)$ is the subgroup of $Aut(X)$ generated by all one-dimensional unipotent subgroups. In dimension $2$ we have some very interesting exceptions. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)

A combinatorial characterization, the $(\star)$-property, is known in $\mathbb P^1 \times \mathbb P^1$. We propose a combinatorial property, $(\star_n)$, that directly generalizes the $(\star)$-property to $(\mathbb P^1)^n$ for larger $n$. We show that $X$ is ACM if and only if it satisfies the $(\star_n)$-property.

We show the Zariski-density of the rational points of $\mathscr{E}$ when $\mathscr{E}$ is isotrivial with non-zero $j$-invariant and when $\mathscr{E}$ is non-isotrivial with a fiber of type $II^*$, $III^*$, $IV^*$ or $I^*_m$ ($m\geq0$).

https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01914;The stratification by rank for homogeneous polynomials with border rank  5 which essentially depend on 5 variables; Edoardo Ballico;  We give the stratification by the symmetric tensor rank of all degree $d \ge 9$ homogeneous polynomials with border rank $5$ and which depend essentially on at least 5 variables, extending previous works (A. Bernardi, A. Gimigliano, M. Id\`{a}, E. Ballico) on lower border ranks. For the polynomials which depend on at least 5 variables only 5 ranks are possible: $5$, $d+3$, $2d+1$, $3d-1$, $4d-3$, but each of the ranks $3d-1$ and $2d+1$ is achieved in two geometrically different situations. These ranks are uniquely determined by a certain degree 5 zero-dimensional scheme $A$ associated to the polynomial. The polynomial $f$ depends essentially on at least 5 variables if and only if $A$ is linearly independent (in all cases $f$ essentially depends on exactly 5 variables). The polynomial has rank $4d-3$ (resp $3d-1$, resp. $2d+1$, resp. $d+3$, resp. $5$) if $A$ has $1$ (resp. $2$, resp. $3$, resp. $4$, resp. $5$) connected components. The assumption $d\ge 9$ guarantees that each polynomial has a uniquely determined associated scheme $A$. In each case we describe the dimension of the families of the polynomials with prescribed rank, each irreducible family being determined by the degrees of the connected components of the associated scheme $A$. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)

This paper explores whether and if so, how, this can be extended to (a) several derivations, (b) one automorphism. Under a natural notion of ""generalized Picard-Vessiot extension"" (in the case of several derivations), we give a counterexample. We also have a counterexample in the case of one automorphism.

We use flat cohomology to classify the quadratic \Gamma-forms defined over $\mathcal{O}_S$ that are locally \Gamma-isomorphic for the flat topology to (V,q) and compare between the genus c(q) and the \Gamma-genus c_{\Gamma}(q) of q. We show that c_{\Gamma}(q) should not inject in c(q). The suggested obstruction arises from the failure of the Witt cancellation theorem for $\mathcal{O}_S$. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05313;Enumerating superspecial curves of genus $4$ over prime fields; Momonari Kudo,  Shushi Harashita;  In this paper we enumerate nonhyperelliptic superspecial curves of genus $4$ over prime fields of characteristic $p\le 11$. Our algorithm works for nonhyperelliptic curves over an arbitrary finite field in characteristic $p \ge 5$. We execute the algorithm for prime fields of $p\le 11$ with our implementation on a computer algebra system Magma. Thanks to the fact that the cardinality of $\mathbb{F}_{p^a}$-isomorphism classes of superspecial curves over $\mathbb{F}_{p^a}$ of a fixed genus depends only on the parity of $a$, this paper contributes to the odd-degree case for genus $4$, whereas our previous paper contributes to the even-degree case. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)

For $\mathcal{F}\ell_4$ and $\mathcal{F}\ell_5$ we compare toric degenerations arising from string polytopes and the FFLV polytope with those obtained from the tropicalization of the flag varieties. We also present a general procedure to find toric degenerations in the cases where the initial ideal arising from a cone of the tropicalization of a variety is not prime. ;"Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Commutative Algebra (math.AC); Combinatorics (math.CO); Representation Theory (math.RT)"

We define a $\delta$-invariant and a $\mu$-invariant for an INNS and prove necessary and sufficient numerical conditions for equinormalizability and weak equinormalizability using $\delta$ and $\mu$. Moreover, we determine the number of connected components of the Milnor fibre of an arbitrary INNS. For families of generically reduced curves, we investigate the topological behavior of the Milnor fibre and characterize topological triviality of such families. Finally we state some open problems and conjectures. In addition we give a survey of classical results about equisingularity and equinormalizability so that the article may be useful as a reference source. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05661;Rank two topological and infinitesimal embedded jump loci of  quasi-projective manifolds; Stefan Papadima,  Alexander I. Suciu;  We study the germs at the origin of $G$-representation varieties and the degree 1 cohomology jump loci of fundamental groups of quasi-projective manifolds. Using the Morgan-Dupont model associated to a convenient compactification of such a manifold, we relate these germs to those of their infinitesimal counterparts, defined in terms of flat connections on those models. When the linear algebraic group $G$ is either $\textrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ or its standard Borel subgroup and the depth of the jump locus is 1, this dictionary works perfectly, allowing us to describe in this way explicit irreducible decompositions for the germs of these embedded jump loci. On the other hand, if either $G=\textrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{C})$ for some $n\ge 3$, or the depth is greater than 1, then certain natural inclusions of germs are strict. ;"Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Algebraic Topology (math.AT); Group Theory (math.GR)"

For all integer $m$ with $n:=\dim(X) \leq m < N$, we show that the contact locus on $X$ of a general tangent $m$-plane is a linear variety if the $m$-th Gauss map is separable. We also show that for smooth $X$ with $n < N-2$, the $(n+1)$-th Gauss map is birational if it is separable, unless $X$ is the Segre embedding $\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^n \subset \mathbb{P}^{2n-1}$.

For a noetherian scheme $X$, there are two kind of motives associated with $X$ in the homotopy category $\operatorname{Ho}(\mathcal{M}ot^{\operatorname{nilp}}_{\operatorname{dg}})$, namely $M_{\operatorname{nilp}}(X)$ and $M_{\operatorname{nilp}}'(X)$. In general $M_{\operatorname{nilp}}(X)$ is not isomorphic to $M'_{\operatorname{nilp}}(X_{\operatorname{red}})$. But there exists a canonical isomorphism $M_{\operatorname{nilp}}'(X)\simeq M_{\operatorname{nilp}}'(X_{\operatorname{red}})$ and if $X$ is regular noetherian separated, $M(X)$ is canonically isomorphic to $M'(X)$. ;"Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Commutative Algebra (math.AC); K-Theory and Homology (math.KT)"

Our main result is a direct geometric proof of the holomorphic anomaly equation in the precise form predicted by B-model physics. The method yields new holomorphic anomaly equations for an infinite class of twisted theories on projective spaces. An example of such a twisted theory is the formal quintic defined by a hyperplane section of CP4 in all genera via the Euler class of a complex. The formal quintic theory is found to satisfy the holomorphic anomaly equations conjectured for the true quintic theory. Therefore, the formal quintic theory and the true quintic theory should be related by transformations which respect the holomorphic anomaly equations. ;"Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)"

Motivated by Hassett's weighted pointed stable curves, we use the log minimal model program to construct compact moduli spaces parameterizing these objects. Moreoever, we show that the domain of weights admits a wall and chamber structure, we describe the induced wall crossing morphisms on the moduli spaces as the weight vector varies, and describe the surfaces that appear on the boundary of the moduli space.

The population is naturally partitioned into an infinite collection of complex cells $\mathbb{C}^m$, where $m$ are some positive integers. For each cell we define an injective rational map $\mathbb{C}^m \to M(A^{(2)}_{2n})$ of the cell to the space $M(A^{(2)}_{2n})$ of Miura opers of type $A^{(2)}_{2n}$. We show that the image of the map is invariant with respect to all mKdV flows on $M(A^{(2)}_{2n})$ and the image is point-wise fixed by all mKdV flows $\frac\partial{\partial t_r}$ with index $r$ greater than $4m$. ;"Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI)"

In this paper we consider a $16$-dimensional family of special Horikawa surfaces which are certain bidouble covers of $\mathbb{P}^2$. The construction is motivated by that of special Kunev surfaces which are counterexamples for infinitesimal Torelli and generic global Torelli problem. The main result of the paper is a generic global Torelli theorem for special Horikawa surfaces. To prove the theorem, we relate the periods of special Horikawa surfaces to the periods of certain lattice polarized $K3$ surfaces using eigenperiod maps and then apply a Torelli type result proved by Laza. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)

In particular the algorithm determines the stable cohomology of the matroidal partial compactification, in terms of simple regular matroids that are irreducible with respect to the 1-sum operation, and their automorphism groups. The algorithm also applies to compute the stable Betti numbers in close to top degree for the perfect cone toroidal compactification. This suggests the existence of an algebra structure on the stable cohomology of the perfect cone compactification in close to top degree. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)

The $P_{12}$-theorem is a precise version of the rough classification of algebraic surfaces, in particular the conditions $P_{12} = 0$, $P_{12} = 1$,$P_{12} \geq 2$ are respectively equivalent to : Kodaira dimension $-\infty, 0 , \geq 1$. The result relies on a main theorem describing the growth of the plurigenera for properly-elliptic or properly quasi-elliptic surfaces (surfaces with Kodaira dimension equal to 1). We also discuss the limit cases, i.e. the families of surfaces which show that the results of the main theorem are sharp. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00497;The moduli space of stable coherent sheaves via non-archimedean geometry; Yunfeng Jiang;  We provide a construction of the moduli space of stable coherent sheaves in the world of non-archimedean geometry, where we use the notion of Berkovich non-archimedean analytic spaces. The motivation for our construction is Tony Yue Yu's non-archimedean enumerative geometry in Gromov-Witten theory. The construction of the moduli space of stable sheaves using Berkovich analytic spaces will give rise to the non-archimedean version of Donaldson-Thomas invariants. In this paper we give the moduli construction over a non-archimedean field $\kk$. We use the machinery of formal schemes, that is, we define and construct the formal moduli stack of (semi)-stable coherent sheaves over a discrete valuation ring $R$, and taking generic fiber we get the non-archimedean analytic moduli of semistable coherent sheaves over the fractional non-archimedean field $\kk$. For a moduli space of stable sheaves of an algebraic variety $X$ over an algebraically closed field $\kappa$, the analytification of such a moduli space gives an example of the non-archimedean moduli space. We generalize Joyce's $d$-critical scheme structure in \cite{Joyce} or Kiem-Li's virtual critical manifolds in \cite{KL} to the world of formal schemes, and Berkovich non-archimedean analytic spaces. As an application, we provide a proof for the motivic localization formula for a $d$-critical non-archimedean $\kk$-analytic space using global motive of vanishing cycles and motivic integration on oriented formal $d$-critical schemes. This generalizes Maulik's motivic localization formula for motivic Donaldson-Thomas invariants. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)

Given such a wall crossing, I construct a perverse sheaf of categories on a disk, singular at a point, with half-monodromies recovering these equivalences, and with behaviour at the singular point controlled by a GIT quotient stack associated to the wall. Taking complexified Grothendieck groups gives a perverse sheaf of vector spaces: I characterise when this is an intersection cohomology complex of a local system on the punctured disk. ;"Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Representation Theory (math.RT)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00636;Non-geodesic variations of Hodge structure of maximum dimension; James A. Carlson,  Domingo Toledo;  There are a number of examples of variations of Hodge structure of maximum dimension. However, to our knowledge, those that are global on the level of the period domain are totally geodesic subspaces that arise from an orbit of a subgroup of the group of the period domain. That is, they are defined by Lie theory rather than by algebraic geometry. In this note, we give an example of a variation of maximum dimension which is nowhere tangent to a geodesic variation. The period domain in question, which classifies weight two Hodge structures with $h^{2,0} = 2$ and $h^{1,1} = 28$, is of dimension $57$. The horizontal tangent bundle has codimension one, thus it is an example of a holomorphic contact structure, with local integral manifolds of dimension 28. The group of the period domain is $SO(4,28)$, and one can produce global integral manifolds as orbits of the action of subgroups isomorphic to $SU(2,14)$. Our example is given by the variation of Hodge structure on the second cohomology of weighted projective hypersurfaces of degree $10$ in a weighted projective three-space with weights $1, 1, 2, 5$ ;"Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Differential Geometry (math.DG)"

The generalized null correlation bundles constituting open dense subsets of these components are defined as cohomology bundles of monads whose members are direct sums of line bundles of degrees depending on nonnegative integers $a,b,c$, where $b\ge a$ and $c>a+b$. We show that, in the wide range when $c>2a+b-e,\ b>a,\ (e,a)\ne(0,0)$, the Ein components are rational, and in the rest cases they are at least stably rational. As a consequence, the union of the spaces $M(e,n)$ over all $n\ge1$ contains an infinite series of rational components. An explicit construction of rationality of Ein components under the above conditions on $e,a,b,c$ and, respectively, of their stable rationality in the rest cases, is given. In case of rationality, we also construct universal families of generalized null correlation bundles over certain open subsets of Ein components showing that these components are fine moduli spaces. Thus, the union of the spaces the $M(e,n)$ over all $n\ge1$ contains an infinite series of rational components. As a by-product of this construction, for $c_1=0$ and $n$ even, these open subsets provide, perhaps the first known, examples of fine moduli spaces not satisfying a usual sufficient condition ""$n$ is odd"" for fineness.

For some of these toric surfaces, the question whether the blow-up is a Mori Dream Space is equivalent to countably many planar interpolation problems.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00905;Euler Characteristics of Crepant Resolutions of Weierstrass Models; Mboyo Esole,  Patrick Jefferson,  Monica Jinwoo Kang;  Based on an identity of Jacobi, we prove a simple formula that computes the pushforward of analytic functions of the exceptional divisor of a blowup of a projective variety along a smooth complete intersection with normal crossing. We apply this pushforward formula to derive generating functions for Euler characteristics of crepant resolutions of singular Weierstrass models given by Tate's algorithm. Since these Euler characteristics depend only on the sequence of blowups and not on the Kodaira fiber itself, nor the associated group, several distinct Tate models have the same Euler characteristic. In the case of elliptic Calabi-Yau threefolds, we also compute the Hodge numbers. For elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau fourfolds, our results also prove a conjecture of Blumenhagen-Grimm-Jurke-Weigand based on F-theory/heterotic string duality. ;"Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)"

In the Rokhlin-Nikulin classification, there are 56 topological types, refined into 64 rigid isotopy classes. We developed software that determines the topological type of a given sextic and used it to compute empirical probability distributions on the various types. We list 64 explicit representatives with integer coefficients, and we perturb these to draw many samples from each class. This allows us to explore how many of the bitangents, inflection points and tensor eigenvectors are real. We also study the real tensor rank, the construction of quartic surfaces with prescribed topology, and the avoidance locus, which is the locus of all real lines that do not meet a given sextic. This is a union of up to 46 convex regions, bounded by the dual curve. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01684;Unmixing the mixed volume computation; Tianran Chen;  Computing mixed volume of convex polytopes is an important problem in computational algebraic geometry. This paper establishes sufficient conditions under which the mixed volume of several convex polytopes exactly equals the normalized volume of the convex hull of their union. Under these conditions the problem of computing mixed volume of several polytopes can be transformed into a volume computation problem for a single polytope in the same dimension. We demonstrate through problems from real world applications that substantial reduction in computational costs can be achieved via this transformation in situations where the convex hull of the union of the polytopes has less complex geometry than the original polytopes. We also discuss the important implications of this result in the polyhedral homotopy method for solving polynomial systems. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01710;A trace formula for the distribution of rational $G$-orbits in ramified  covers, adapted to representation stability; Nir Gadish;  A standard observation in algebraic geometry and number theory is that a ramified cover of an algebraic variety $\widetilde{X}\rightarrow X$ over a finite field $F_q$ furnishes the rational points $x\in X(F_q)$ with additional arithmetic structure: the Frobenius action on the fiber over $x$. For example, in the case of the Vieta cover of polynomials over $F_q$ this structure describes a polynomial's irreducible decomposition type. Furthermore, the distribution of these Frobenius actions is encoded in the cohomology of $\widetilde{X}$ via the Grothendieck-Lefschetz trace formula. This note presents a version of the trace formula that is suited for studying the distribution in the context of representation stability: for certain sequences of varieties $(\widetilde{X}_n)$ the cohomology, and therefore the distribution of the Frobenius actions, stabilizes in a precise sense. We conclude by fully working out the example of the Vieta cover of the variety of polynomials. The calculation includes the distribution of cycle decompositions on cosets of Young subgroups of the symmetric group, which might be of independent interest. ;"Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Combinatorics (math.CO); Number Theory (math.NT)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01869;About the Fricke-Macbeath curve; Ruben A. Hidalgo;"  A Hurwitz curve is a closed Riemann surface of genus $g \geq 2$ whose group of conformal automorphisms has order $84(g-1)$. In 1895, Wiman proved that for $g=3$ there is, up to isomorphisms, a unique Hurwitz curve; this being Klein's plane quartic curve. Moreover, he also proved that there is no Hurwitz curve of genus $g=2,4,5,6$. Later, in 1965, Macbeath proved the existence, up to isomorphisms, of a unique Hurwitz curve of genus $g=7$; this known as the Fricke-Macbeath curve. Equations were also provided; that being the fiber product of suitable three elliptic curves. In the same year, Edge constructed such a genus seven Hurwitz curve by elementary projective geometry. Such a construction was provided by first constructing a $4$-dimensional family of closed Riemann surfaces $S_{\mu}$ admitting a group $G_{\mu} \cong {\mathbb Z}_{2}^{3}$ of conformal automorphisms so that $S_{\mu}/G_{\mu}$ has genus zero. In this paper we discuss the above curves in terms of fiber products of classical Fermat curves and we provide a geometrical explanation of the three elliptic curves in Wiman's description. We also observe that the jacobian variety of the surface $S_{\mu}$ is isogenous to the product of seven elliptic curves (explicitly given) and, for the particular Fricke-Macbeath curve, we obtain the well known fact that its jacobian variety is isogenous to $E^{7}$ for a suitable elliptic curve $E$.

By introducing scaling coefficients to the monomial parameterization of the toric variety, one can change the ML degree. We show that the ML degree is equal to the degree of the toric variety for generic scalings, while it drops if and only if the scaling vector is in the locus of the principal $A$-determinant. We also illustrate how to compute the ML estimate of a toric variety numerically via homotopy continuation from a scaled toric variety with low ML degree. Throughout, we include examples motivated by algebraic geometry and statistics. We compute the ML degree of rational normal scrolls and a large class of Veronese-type varieties. In addition, we investigate the ML degree of scaled Segre varieties, hierarchical loglinear models, and graphical models. ;"Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Statistics Theory (math.ST); Computation (stat.CO)"

All previously known examples have at most 5 positive solutions. Tropical geometry is a powerful tool to construct polynomial systems with many positive solutions. The classical combinatorial patchworking method arises when the tropical hypersurfaces intersect transversally. In this paper, we prove that a system as above constructed using this method has at most 6 positive solutions. We also show that this bound is sharp. Moreover, using non-transversal intersections of tropical curves, we construct a system as above having 7 positive solutions. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)

In particular, we are interested in the systematic construction and classification of these varieties. Our main result is the full classification of threefolds isogenous to a product of mixed type with $\chi(\mathcal O_X)=-1$ assuming that any automorphism in $G$, which restricts to the trivial element in $Aut(C_i)$ for some $C_i$, is the identity on the product. Since the holomorphic Euler-Poincar\'e-characteristic of a smooth threefold of general type with ample canonical class is always negative, these examples lie on the boundary, in the sense of threefold geography. To achieve our result we use techniques from computational group theory. Indeed, we develop a MAGMA algorithm to classify these threefolds for any given value of $\chi(\mathcal O_X)$. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02325;Homological algebra in characteristic one; Alain Connes,  Caterina Consani;  This article develops several main results for a general theory of homological algebra in categories such as the category of sheaves of idempotent modules over a topos. In the analogy with the development of homological algebra for abelian categories the present paper should be viewed as the analogue of the development of homological algebra for abelian groups. Our selected prototype, the category Bmod of modules over the Boolean semifield B is the replacement for the category of abelian groups. We show that the semi-additive category Bmod fulfills analogues of the axioms AB1 and AB2 for abelian categories. By introducing a precise comonad on Bmod we obtain the conceptually related Kleisli and Eilenberg-Moore categories. The latter category Bmod^s is simply Bmod in the topos of sets endowed with an involution and as such it shares with Bmod most of its abstract categorical properties. The three main results of the paper are the following. First, when endowed with the natural ideal of null morphisms, the category Bmod^s is a semi-exact, homological category in the sense of M. Grandis. Second, there is a far reaching analogy between Bmod^s and the category of operators in Hilbert space, and in particular results relating null kernel and injectivity for morphisms. The third fundamental result is that, even for finite objects of Bmod^s the resulting homological algebra is non-trivial and gives rise to a computable Ext functor. We determine explicitly this functor in the case provided by the diagonal morphism of the Boolean semiring into its square. ;"Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Algebraic Topology (math.AT); Category Theory (math.CT); Number Theory (math.NT)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02513;Enumeration of singular varieties with tangency conditions; Yu-jong Tzeng;  We construct the algebraic cobordism theory of bundles and divisors on varieties. It has a simple basis (over Q) from projective spaces and its rank is equal to the number of Chern numbers. An application of this algebraic cobordism theory is the enumeration of singular subvarieties with give tangent conditions with a fixed smooth divisor, where the subvariety is the zero locus of a section of a vector bundle. We prove that the generating series of numbers of such subvarieties gives a homomorphism from the algebraic cobordism group to the power series ring. This implies that the enumeration of singular subvarieties with tangency conditions is governed by universal polynomials of Chern numbers, when the vector bundle is sufficiently ample. This result combines and generalizes the Caporaso-Harris recursive formula, Gottsche's conjecture, classical De Jonquiere's Formula and node polynomials from tropical geometry. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02637;Effective identifiability criteria for tensors and polynomials; Alex Massarenti,  Massimiliano Mella,  Giovanni Staglianò;  A tensor $T$, in a given tensor space, is said to be $h$-identifiable if it admits a unique decomposition as a sum of $h$ rank one tensors. A criterion for $h$-identifiability is called effective if it is satisfied in a dense, open subset of the set of rank $h$ tensors. In this paper we give effective $h$-identifiability criteria for a large class of tensors. We then improve these criteria for some symmetric tensors. For instance, this allows us to give a complete set of effective identifiability criteria for ternary quintic polynomial. Finally, we implement our identifiability algorithms in Macaulay2. ;"Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Computational Geometry (cs.CG)"

In particular, the smoothability of finite schemes does not depend on the embedding into a smooth variety or on base field extensions.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02954;Higher Ramanujan equations II: periods of abelian varieties and  transcendence questions; Tiago J. Fonseca;"  In the first part of this work, we have considered a moduli space $B_g$ classifying principally polarized abelian varieties of dimension $g$ endowed with a symplectic-Hodge basis, and we have constructed the higher Ramanujan vector fields $(v_{kl})_{1\le k\le l \le g}$ on it. In this second part, we study these objects from a complex analytic viewpoint. We construct a holomorphic map $\varphi_g : \mathbf{H}_g \to B_g(\mathbf{C})$, where $\mathbf{H}_g$ denotes the Siegel upper half-space of genus $g$, satisfying the system of differential equations $\frac{1}{2\pi i}\frac{\partial \varphi_g}{\partial \tau_{kl}}=v_{kl}\circ \varphi_g$, $1\le k\le l \le g$. When $g=1$, we prove that $\varphi_1$ may be identified with the triple of Eisenstein series $(E_2,E_4,E_6)$, so that the previous differential equations coincide with Ramanujan's classical relations concerning Eisenstein series. We discuss the relation between the values of $\varphi_g$ and the fields of periods of abelian varieties, and we explain how this relates to Grothendieck's periods conjecture. Finally, we prove that every leaf of the holomorphic foliation on $B_g(\mathbf{C})$ induced by the vector fields $v_{kl}$ is Zariski-dense in $B_{g,\mathbf{C}}$. This last result implies a ""functional version"" of Grothendieck's periods conjecture for abelian varieties. ";"Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Number Theory (math.NT)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03014;Degree-optimal moving frames for rational curves; Hoon Hong,  Zachary Hough,  Irina A. Kogan,  Zijia Li;  We present an algorithm that, for a given vector $\mathbf{a}$ of $n$ relatively prime polynomials in one variable over an arbitrary field $\mathbb{K}$, outputs an $n\times n$ invertible matrix $P$ with polynomial entries such that it forms a $\mathit{\text{degree-optimal moving frame}}$ for the rational curve defined by $\mathbf{a}$. From an algebraic point of view, the first column of the matrix $P$ consists of a minimal-degree B\'ezout vector (a minimal-degree solution to the univariate effective Nullstellensatz problem) of $\mathbf{a}$, and the last $n-1$ columns comprise an optimal-degree basis, called a $\mu$-basis, of the syzygy module of $\mathbf{a}$. To develop the algorithm, we prove several new theoretical results on the relationship between optimal moving frames, minimal-degree B\'ezout vectors, and $\mu$-bases. In particular, we show how the degrees bounds of these objects are related. The theory developed in this paper allows us to compute an optimal moving frame by extension of a $\mu$-basis algorithm presented earlier by Hong, Hough, and Kogan. The main step of the algorithm is a partial row-echelon reduction of a $(2d+1)\times(nd+n+1)$ matrix over $\mathbb{K}$, where $d$ is the maximum degree of the input $\mathbf{a}$. Our literature search did not yield any other algorithms for computing degree-optimal moving frames or minimal-degree B\'ezout vectors. We compare our algorithm with a non-optimal moving frame algorithm based on a generalized version of Euclid's extended gcd algorithm. ;"Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Commutative Algebra (math.AC)"

We show that all linear $A$-hypergeometric transformations arise from symmetries of the corresponding polytope.

For affine B, a perfect obstruction theory gives rise to a virtual fundamental class in a twisted Borel-Moore E-homology for arbitrary E. This includes motivic cohomology (homotopy invariant) K-theory algebraic cobordism and the oriented Chow groups of Barge-Morel and Fasel. In the case of motivic cohomology, we recover the constructions of Behrend-Fantechi, with values in the Chow group. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)

A semistable Riemann-Hurwitz formula for these abelian coverings will be proved, which will be based on the Laplacian operator for intersection graphs. We will then reconstruct the Berkovich minimal skeleton of $\mathcal{C}$ from the minimal skeleton of $\mathcal{D}$.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03081;Enriques surfaces with normal K3-like coverings; Stefan Schröer;  We study simply-connected Enriques surface in characteristic two whose K3-like covering is normal, building on the work of Ekedahl, Hyland and Shepherd-Barron. We develop general methods to construct examples in a systematic fashion, including the case that the K3-like covering is a normal rational surface rather then a normal K3 surface. Among other things, we show that an elliptic double point actually may occur. In this case, there are no other singularities present. Furthermore, we show that each of the 110 possible configuration of Kodaira types on rational elliptic surfaces with only reduced fibers actually do occur on a simply-connected Enriques surface whose K3-like covering has only rational double points, with one possible exception. Our results hinge on Lang's classification of rational elliptic surfaces, the determination of their Mordell--Weil lattices by Shioda and Oguiso, and the behavior of unstable fibers under Frobenius pullback via Ogg's Formula. The main idea is to apply suitable flops to the Frobenius pullback of a rational elliptic surface, to get the desired K3-like covering. Along the way, we develop a theory of Zariski singularities in arbitrary dimension, which is tightly interwoven with the theory of actions of height-one group schemes and restricted Lie algebras. Furthermore, we determine under what conditions tangent sheaves are locally free, and introduce a theory of canonical coverings for arbitrary proper algebraic schemes. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03144;Folding procedure for Newton-Okounkov polytopes of Schubert varieties; Naoki Fujita;  The theory of Newton-Okounkov polytopes is a generalization of that of Newton polytopes for toric varieties, and it gives a systematic method of constructing toric degenerations of a projective variety. In the case of Schubert varieties, their Newton-Okounkov polytopes are deeply connected with representation theory. Indeed, Littelmann's string polytopes and Nakashima-Zelevinsky's polyhedral realizations are obtained as Newton-Okounkov polytopes of Schubert varieties. In this paper, we apply the folding procedure to a Newton-Okounkov polytope of a Schubert variety, which relates Newton-Okounkov polytopes of Schubert varieties of different types. As an application of this result, we obtain a new interpretation of Kashiwara's similarity of crystal bases. ;"Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Quantum Algebra (math.QA); Representation Theory (math.RT)"

Using a different approach, we generalize this to an arbitrary connected algebraic subgroup $G \subset {\bf GL}(V)$ and a complex manifold containing an immersed rational curve. We also prove a partial converse: a construction of a holomorphic $G$-structure on a homogeneous complex manifold containing smooth rational curves, under the condition that $G$ has no nonzero fixed vector in $V$ and the prolongation of the Lie algebra of $G$ is finite-dimensional and nonzero. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)

Our results together form a flexible framework for doing analysis over local fields in a field-independent way. As corollaries, we obtain many new transfer principles, for example, for local constancy, continuity, and existence of various kinds of limits.

The derived series of this group reflects an iteration of Cox rings of surface singularities. We extend this picture to log terminal singularities in any dimension coming with a torus action of complexity one. In this setting, the previously finite groups become solvable torus extensions.

These are the non-archimedean analytic spaces which admit an affine special formal scheme as model over a complete discrete valuation ring, such as for example open or closed polydiscs or polyannuli. Using Weil restrictions and Galois fixed loci for semi-affinoid spaces and their formal models, we describe a formal model of a $K$-analytic space $X$, provided that $X\otimes_KL$ is semi-affinoid for some finite tamely ramified extension $L$ of $K$. As an application, we study the forms of analytic annuli that are trivialized by a wide class of Galois extensions that includes totally tamely ramified extensions. In order to do so, we first establish a Weierstrass preparation result for analytic functions on annuli, and use it to linearize finite order automorphisms of annuli. Finally, we explain how from these results one can deduce a non-archimedean analytic proof of the existence of resolutions of singularities of surfaces in characteristic zero. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)

Beauville's conjectural splitting property predicts that each Chow group of $X$ should split in a finite number of pieces. The Bloch-Beilinson conjectures predict how $G$ should act on these pieces of the Chow groups: certain pieces should be invariant under $G$, while certain other pieces should not contain any non-trivial $G$-invariant cycle. We can prove this for two pieces of the Chow groups when $X$ is the Hilbert scheme of a $K3$ surface and $G$ consists of natural automorphisms. This has consequences for the Chow ring of the quotient $X/G$. ";Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)

The method is interesting in other contexts: our key lemmas turn out to give a simple proof that, if $f:X\to Y$ is a separated morphism of quasicompact, quasiseparated schemes such that $Rf_*:D_{qc}(X)\to D_{qc}(Y)$ takes perfect complexes to complexes of bounded-below Tor-amplitude, then $f$ must be of finite Tor-dimension. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)

Since a polynomial $f$ is stable if and only if $\mathcal{I}(f) \cap \mathbb{R}_{>0}^n \ = \ \emptyset$, the notion offers a novel geometric view underlying stability questions of polynomials. In this article, we study the relation between the imaginary projections and hyperbolicity cones, where the latter ones are only defined for homogeneous polynomials. Building upon this, for homogeneous polynomials we provide a tight upper bound for the number of components in the complement $\mathcal{I}(f)^{c}$ and thus for the number of hyperbolicity cones of $f$.

In this paper we extend the method to include an additional step of second descent. Assuming finiteness of the relevant Tate-Shafarevich groups, we use the extended method to show that the Brauer-Manin obstruction is the only obstruction to the Hasse principle on Kummer varieties associated to abelian varieties with all rational 2-torsion, under mild additional hypotheses. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05062;An application of random plane slicing to counting $\mathbb{F}_q$-points  on hypersurfaces; Kaloyan Slavov;  Let $X$ be an absolutely irreducible hypersurface of degree $d$ in $\mathbb{A}^n$, defined over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$. The Lang-Weil bound gives an interval that contains $#X(\mathbb{F}_q)$. We exhibit an explicit interval, which does not contain $#X(\mathbb{F}_q)$, and which overlaps with the Lang-Weil interval. In particular, we sharpen the best known nontrivial lower bound for $#X(\mathbb{F}_q)$. The proof uses a combinatorial probabilistic technique. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05197;Normalization of closed Ekedahl-Oort strata; Jean-Stefan Koskivirta;  We apply our theory of partial flag spaces developed in previous articles to study a group-theoretical generalization of the canonical filtration of a truncated Barsotti-Tate group of level 1. As an application, we determine explicitly the normalization of the Zariski closures of Ekedahl-Oort strata of Shimura varieties of Hodge-type as certain closed coarse strata in the associated partial flag spaces. ;"Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Group Theory (math.GR)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05226;Graded linearisations; Gergely Bérczi,  Brent Doran,  Frances Kirwan;  When the action of a reductive group on a projective variety has a suitable linearisation, Mumford's geometric invariant theory (GIT) can be used to construct and study an associated quotient variety. In this article we describe how Mumford's GIT can be extended effectively to suitable actions of linear algebraic groups which are not necessarily reductive, with the extra data of a graded linearisation for the action. Any linearisation in the traditional sense for a reductive group action induces a graded linearisation in a natural way. The classical examples of moduli spaces which can be constructed using Mumford's GIT are moduli spaces of stable curves and of (semi)stable bundles over a fixed nonsingular curve. This more general construction can be used to construct moduli spaces of unstable objects, such as unstable curves or unstable bundles (with suitable fixed discrete invariants in each case, related to their singularities or Harder--Narasimhan type). ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05266;Classification of Minimal Polygons with Specified Singularity Content; Daniel Cavey,  Edwin Kutas;  It is known that there are only finitely many mutation-equivalence classes with a given singularity content, and each of these equivalence classes contains only finitely many minimal polygons. We describe an efficient algorithm to classify these minimal polygons. To illustrate this algorithm we compute all mutation-equivalence classes of Fano polygons with a fixed basket of singularities in two examples. ;Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05362;Chow-Witt rings of classifying spaces for symplectic and special linear  groups; Jens Hornbostel,  Matthias Wendt;  We compute the Chow-Witt rings of the classifying spaces for the symplectic and special linear groups. In the structural description we give, contributions from real and complex realization are clearly visible. In particular, the computation of cohomology with $\mathbf{I}^j$-coefficients is done closely along the lines of Brown's computation of integral cohomology for special orthogonal groups. The computations for the symplectic groups show that Chow-Witt groups are a symplectically oriented ring cohomology theory. Using our computations for special linear groups, we also discuss the question when an oriented vector bundle of odd rank splits off a trivial summand. ;"Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Algebraic Topology (math.AT); K-Theory and Homology (math.KT)"
