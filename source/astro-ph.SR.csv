https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.0001;Binary Contamination in the SEGUE sample: Effects on SSPP Determinations  of Stellar Atmospheric Parameters; Katharine J. Schlesinger,  Jennifer A. Johnson,  Young Sun Lee,  Thomas Masseron,  Brian Yanny,  Constance M. Rockosi,  B. Scott Gaudi,  Timothy C. Beers;"  Using numerical modeling and a grid of synthetic spectra, we examine the effects that unresolved binaries have on the determination of various stellar atmospheric parameters for SEGUE targets measured using the SEGUE Stellar Parameter Pipeline (SSPP). To model undetected binaries that may be in the SEGUE sample, we use a variety of mass distributions for the primary and secondary stars in conjunction with empirically determined relationships for orbital parameters to determine the fraction of G-K dwarf stars, as defined by SDSS color cuts, that will be blended with a secondary companion. We focus on the G-K dwarf sample in SEGUE as it records the history of chemical enrichment in our galaxy. To determine the effect of the secondary on the spectroscopic parameters, we synthesize a grid of model spectra from 3275 to 7850 K (~0.1 to 1.0 \msun) and [Fe/H]=-0.5 to -2.5 from MARCS model atmospheres using TurboSpectrum. We analyze both ""infinite"" signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) models and degraded versions, at median S/N of 50, 25 and 10. By running individual and combined spectra (representing the binaries) through the SSPP, we determine that ~10% of the blended G-K dwarf pairs with S/N>=25 will have their atmospheric parameter determinations, in particular temperature and metallicity, noticeably affected by the presence of an undetected secondary. To account for the additional uncertainty from binary contamination at a S/N~10, uncertainties of ~140 K and ~0.17 dex in [Fe/H] must be added in quadrature to the published uncertainties of the SSPP.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.0025;Magnetic Doppler imaging of alpha^2 Canum Venaticorum in all four Stokes  parameters. Unveiling the hidden complexity of stellar magnetic fields; O. Kochukhov,  G.A. Wade;"  Strong organized magnetic fields have been studied in the upper main sequence chemically peculiar stars for more than half a century. However, only recently have observational methods and numerical techniques become sufficiently mature to allow us to record and interpret high-resolution four Stokes parameter spectra, leading to the first assumption-free magnetic field models of these stars. Here we present a detailed magnetic Doppler imaging analysis of the spectropolarimetric observations of the prototypical magnetic Ap star alpha^2 CVn. The surface abundance distributions of Fe and Cr and a full vector map of the stellar magnetic field are reconstructed in a self-consistent inversion using our state-of-the-art magnetic Doppler imaging code Invers10. We succeeded in reproducing most of the details of the available spectropolarimetric observations of alpha^2 CVn with a magnetic map which combines a global dipolar-like field topology with localized spots of higher field intensity. We demonstrate that these small-scale magnetic structures are inevitably required to fit the linear polarization spectra; however, their presence cannot be inferred from the Stokes I and V observations alone. Our magnetic Doppler imaging analysis of alpha^2 CVn and previous results for 53 Cam support the view that the upper main sequence stars can harbour fairly complex surface magnetic fields which resemble oblique dipoles only at the largest spatial scales. Spectra in all four Stokes parameters are absolutely essential to unveil and meaningfully characterize this field complexity in Ap stars. We therefore suggest that understanding magnetism of stars in other parts of the H-R diagram is similarly incomplete without investigation of their linear polarization spectra.

Uitenbroek;  We investigated the radiative emission of different types of solar features in the spectral range of the Ca II K line. We analyzed full-disk 2k x 2k observations from the PSPT Precision Solar Photometric Telescope. The data were obtained by using three narrow-band interference filters that sample the Ca II K line with different pass bands. Two filters are centered in the line core, the other in the red wing of the line. We measured the intensity and contrast of various solar features, specifically quiet Sun (inter-network), network, enhanced network, plage, and bright plage (facula) regions. Moreover, we compared the results obtained with those derived from the numerical synthesis performed for the three PSPT filters with a widely used radiative code on a set of reference semi-empirical atmosphere models. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.0288;VLT-MAD observations of the core of 30 Doradus; M. A. Campbell (IfA, University of Edinburgh),  C. J. Evans,  A. D. Mackey,  M. Gieles,  J. Alves,  J. Ascenso,  N. Bastian,  A. J. Longmore;"  We present H- and Ks-band imaging of three fields at the centre of 30 Doradus in the Large Magellanic Cloud, obtained as part of the Science Demonstration programme with the Multi-conjugate Adaptive optics Demonstrator (MAD) at the Very Large Telescope. Strehl ratios of 15-30% were achieved in the Ks-band, yielding near-infrared images of this dense and complex region at unprecedented angular resolution at these wavelengths. The MAD data are used to construct a near-infrared luminosity profile for R136, the cluster at the core of 30 Dor. Using cluster profiles of the form used by Elson et al., we find the surface brightness can be fit by a relatively shallow power-law function (gamma~1.5-1.7) over the full extent of the MAD data, which extends to a radius of ~40"" (~10pc). We do not see compelling evidence for a break in the luminosity profile as seen in optical data in the literature, arguing that cluster asymmetries are the dominant source, although extinction effects and stars from nearby triggered star-formation likely also contribute. These results highlight the need to consider cluster asymmetries and multiple spatial components in interpretation of the luminosity profiles of distant unresolved clusters. We also investigate seven candidate young stellar objects reported by Gruendl & Chu from Spitzer observations, six of which have apparent counterparts in the MAD images. The most interesting of these (GC09: 053839.24-690552.3) appears related to a striking bow-shock--like feature, orientated away from both R136 and the Wolf-Rayet star Brey 75, at distances of 19.5"" and 8"" (4.7 and 1.9pc in projection), respectively.

Kohl,  Mari Paz Miralles,  Adriaan A. van Ballegooijen (Harvard-Smithsonian CfA);  This paper reviews our growing understanding of the physics behind coronal heating (in open-field regions) and the acceleration of the solar wind. Many new insights have come from the last solar cycle's worth of observations and theoretical work. Measurements of the plasma properties in the extended corona, where the primary solar wind acceleration occurs, have been key to discriminating between competing theories. We describe how UVCS/SOHO measurements of coronal holes and streamers over the last 14 years have provided clues about the detailed kinetic processes that energize both fast and slow wind regions. We also present a brief survey of current ideas involving the coronal source regions of fast and slow wind streams, and how these change over the solar cycle. These source regions are discussed in the context of recent theoretical models (based on Alfven waves and MHD turbulence) that have begun to successfully predict both the heating and acceleration in fast and slow wind regions with essentially no free parameters. Some new results regarding these models - including a quantitative prediction of the lower density and temperature at 1 AU seen during the present solar minimum in comparison to the prior minimum - are also shown. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Johns-Krull,  J. N. Winn,  J. A. Johnson,  R. Mundt;"  Na I D lines in the spectrum of the young binary KH 15D have been analyzed in detail. We find an excess absorption component that may be attributed to foreground interstellar absorption, and to gas possibly associated with the solids in the circumbinary disk. The derived column density is log N_NaI = 12.5 cm^-2, centered on a radial velocity that is consistent with the systemic velocity. Subtracting the likely contribution of the ISM leaves log N_NaI ~ 12.3 cm^-2. There is no detectable change in the gas column density across the ""knife edge"" formed by the opaque grain disk, indicating that the gas and solids have very different scale heights, with the solids being highly settled. Our data support a picture of this circumbinary disk as being composed of a very thin particulate grain layer composed of millimeter-sized or larger objects that are settled within whatever remaining gas may be present. This phase of disk evolution has been hypothesized to exist as a prelude to the formation of planetesimals through gravitational fragmentation, and is expected to be short-lived if much gas were still present in such a disk. Our analysis also reveals the presence of excess Na I emission relative to the comparison spectrum at the radial velocity of the currently visible star that plausibly arises within the magnetosphere of this still-accreting young star.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.0397;Coherent Lateral Motion of Penumbral Filaments during X-class Flare; S. Gosain,  P. Venkatakrishnan,  Sanjiv Kumar Tiwari;  The high-resolution pictures of the solar photosphere from space based 50 cm Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) on-board Hinode spacecraft, are now routinely observed. Such images of a delta-sunspot in NOAA 10930 were obtained by Hinode during 13 December 2006 while a X-class flare occurred in this active region. Two bright ribbons were visible even in white light and G-band images apart from chromospheric Ca II H images. We register the sunspot globally using cross-correlation technique and analyse local effects during flare interval. We find that during flare the penumbral filaments show lateral motion. Also, we locate two patches, one in either polarity, which show converging motion towards the polarity inversion line (PIL). In Ca II H images we find kernel with pre-flare brightening which lie along the PIL. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.0413;Statistical properties of flares and sunspots over the solar cycle; M. Temmer;  The present paper reviews results derived from statistical studies on solar activity indices. The prolonged minimum phase of cycle 23 raised the question of peculiarities inherent in cycle 23. The most important solar activity index is the relative sunspot number and though most of other indices are closely related, shifts are obtained between their peak activity of the order of 1-2 years. These shifts reveal a 22-yr pattern which can be attributed to solar interior or dynamo related processes. The minimum phase of cycle 23 is not found to be exceptional. Investigating the relative sunspot numbers over the past 150 years, solar cycles of more prolonged minima are observed. Since 1920 solar activity is quite high ('modern maximum') and cycle 23 might be the herald of the end of this phase. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.0469;Three-Dimensional Propagation of Magnetohydrodynamic Waves in Solar  Coronal Arcades; S. Rial,  I. Arregui,  J. Terradas,  R. Oliver,  J.L. Ballester;  We numerically investigate the excitation and temporal evolution of oscillations in a two-dimensional coronal arcade by including the three-dimensional propagation of perturbations. The time evolution of impulsively generated perturbations is studied by solving the linear, ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations in the zero-beta approximation. As we neglect gas pressure the slow mode is absent and therefore only coupled MHD fast and Alfven modes remain. Two types of numerical experiments are performed. First, the resonant wave energy transfer between a fast normal mode of the system and local Alfven waves is analyzed. It is seen how, because of resonant coupling, the fast wave with global character transfers its energy to Alfvenic oscillations localized around a particular magnetic surface within the arcade, thus producing the damping of the initial fast MHD mode. Second, the time evolution of a localized impulsive excitation, trying to mimic a nearby coronal disturbance, is considered. In this case, the generated fast wavefront leaves its energy on several magnetic surfaces within the arcade. The system is therefore able to trap energy in the form of Alfvenic oscillations, even in the absence of a density enhancement such as that of a coronal loop. These local oscillations are subsequently phase-mixed to smaller spatial scales. The amount of wave energy trapped by the system via wave energy conversion strongly depends on the wavelength of perturbations in the perpendicular direction, but is almost independent from the ratio of the magnetic to density scale heights. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.0506;Low magnetic-Prandtl number flow configurations for cold astrophysical  disk models: speculation and analysis; O. M. Umurhan;  Simulations of astrophysical disks in the shearing box that are subject to the magnetorotational instability (MRI) show that activity appears to be reduced as the magnetic Prandtl number (Pm) is lowered. On the other hand, calculations for laboratory experiments show that saturation is achieved through modification of the background shear for Pm << 1. Guided by the results of calculations appropriate for laboratory experiments when Pm is very low, the axisymmetric stability of inviscid disturbances in a shearing box model immersed in a constant vertical background magnetic field is considered under a variety of shear profiles and boundary conditions in order to evaluate the hypothesis that modifications of the shear bring about saturation of the instability. It is found that the emergence and stability of the MRI is sensitive to the boundary conditions adopted. Channel modes do not appear to be stabilized through any modification of the background shear whose average remains Keplerian. However, systems that have non-penetrative boundaries can saturate the MRI through modification of the background shear. Conceptually equating the qualitative results from laboratory experiments to the conditions in a disk may therefore be misleading. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM)"

These properties make it a member of the intermediate-mass class of binary pulsar (IMBP) systems. We have been timing this pulsar since its discovery in 2002. Concentrated observations at the Green Bank Telescope, augmented with data from the Parkes and Nancay observatories, have allowed us to determine the general relativistic Shapiro delay. This has yielded pulsar and white dwarf mass measurements of 1.24(11) and 0.78(4) solar masses (68% confidence), respectively. The low mass of the pulsar, the high mass of the WD companion, the short orbital period, and the pulsar spin period may be explained by the system having gone through a common-envelope phase in its evolution. We argue that selection effects may contribute to the relatively small number of known IMBPs. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.0596;X-Ray Studies of Supernova Remnants: A Different View of Supernova  Explosions; Carles Badenes;  The unprecedented spatial and spectral resolutions of Chandra have revolutionized our view of the X-ray emission from supernova remnants. The excellent data sets accumulated on young, ejecta dominated objects like Cas A or Tycho present a unique opportunity to study at the same time the chemical and physical structure of the explosion debris and the characteristics of the circumstellar medium sculpted by the progenitor before the explosion. Supernova remnants can thus put strong constraints on fundamental aspects of both supernova explosion physics and stellar evolution scenarios for supernova progenitors. This view of the supernova phenomenon is completely independent of, and complementary to, the study of distant extragalactic supernovae at optical wavelengths. The calibration of these two techniques has recently become possible thanks to the detection and spectroscopic follow-up of supernova light echoes. In this paper, I will review the most relevant results on supernova remnants obtained during the first decade of Chandra, and the impact that these results have had on open issues in supernova research. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO)"

Levesque,  Peter J. Challis,  Inese I. Ivans,  James E. Rhoads,  Alicia M. Soderberg;"  Despite both being outbursts of luminous blue variables (LBVs), SN 2009ip and UGC 2773 OT2009-1 have very different progenitors, spectra, circumstellar environments, and possibly physical mechanisms that generated the outbursts. From pre-eruption HST images, we determine that SN 2009ip and UGC 2773 OT2009-1 have initial masses of >60 and >25 M_sun, respectively. Optical spectroscopy shows that at peak SN 2009ip had a 10,000 K photosphere and its spectrum was dominated by narrow H Balmer emission, similar to classical LBV giant outbursts, also known as ""supernova impostors."" The spectra of UGC 2773 OT2009-1, which also have narrow H alpha emission, are dominated by a forest of absorption lines, similar to an F-type supergiant. Blueshifted absorption lines corresponding to ejecta at a velocity of 2000 - 7000 km/s are present in later spectra of SN 2009ip -- an unprecedented observation for LBV outbursts, indicating that the event was the result of a supersonic explosion, rather than a subsonic outburst. The velocity of the absorption lines increases between two epochs, suggesting that there were two explosions in rapid succession. A rapid fading and rebrightening event concurrent with the onset of the high-velocity absorption lines is consistent with the double-explosion model. A near-infrared excess is present in the spectra and photometry of UGC 2773 OT2009-1 that is consistent with ~2100 K dust emission. We compare the properties of these two events and place them in the context of other known massive star outbursts such as eta Car, NGC 300 OT2008-1, and SN 2008S. This qualitative analysis suggests that massive star outbursts have many physical differences which can manifest as the different observables seen in these two interesting objects.

Low-resolution 0.8-2.4 micron spectroscopy obtained with IRTF/SpeX shows strong H2O and CH4 absorption bands, consistent with a T7.5 spectral type, and we see possible indications of NH3 absorption in the 1.0-1.3 micron region. More importantly, the spectrum of ULAS J1416+1348 shows a broadened Y-band peak and highly suppressed K-band flux, both indicative of high surface gravity and/or subsolar metallicity. These traits are verified through spectral model fits, from which we derive atmospheric parameters Teff = 650+/-60 K, log g = 5.2+/-0.4 cgs, [M/H] <= -0.3 and Kzz = 10^4 cm^2/s, the temperature being significantly warmer than that estimated by Burningham et al. These fits also indicate a model-dependent spectroscopic distance of 10.6(+3.0,-2.8) pc for ULAS J1416+1348, formally consistent with the 7.9+/-1.7 pc astrometric distance for SDSS J1416+1348 from Scholz.

We utilise V band and white-light photometry to obtain a light curve and period of the system, and spectra at different resolutions to calculate preliminary orbital parameters and spectral classes for the components. Our results suggest that B17 is an eclipsing, double-lined, spectroscopic binary with a period of 4.0217+/-0.0004 days, with two massive evolved components with preliminary classifications of O7 and O9 supergiants.

Ayala;  We present an observational study of the planetary nebula (PN) NGC 7354 consisting of narrowband Halpha and [NII]6584 imaging as well as low- and high-dispersion long-slit spectroscopy and VLA-D radio continuum. According to our imaging and spectroscopic data, NGC 7354 has four main structures: a quite round outer shell and an elliptical inner shell, a collection of low-excitation bright knots roughly concentrated on the equatorial region of the nebula, and two symmetrical jet-like features, not aligned either with the shells' axes, or with each other. We have obtained physical parameters like electron temperature and electron density as well as ionic and elemental abundances for these different structures. Electron temperature and electron density slightly vary throughout the nebula. The local extinction coefficient c_Hbeta shows an increasing gradient from south to north and a decreasing gradient from east to west consistent with the number of equatorial bright knots present in each direction. Abundance values show slight internal variations but most of them are within the estimated uncertainties. In general, abundance values are in good agreement with the ones expected for PNe. Radio continuum data are consistent with optically thin thermal emission. We have used the interactive three-dimensional modeling tool SHAPE to reproduce the observed morphokinematic structures in NGC 7354 with different geometrical components. Our SHAPE model is in very good agreement with our imaging and spectroscopic observations. Finally, after modeling NGC 7354 with SHAPE, we suggest a possible scenario for the formation of the nebula. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Olshevsky,  M. Collados;"  We present comparison of numerical simulations of propagation of MHD waves,excited by subphotospheric perturbations, in two different (""deep"" and ""shallow"") magnetostatic models of the sunspots. The ""deep"" sunspot model distorts both the shape of the wavefront and its amplitude stronger than the ""shallow"" model. For both sunspot models, the surface gravity waves (f-mode) are affected by the sunspots stronger than the acoustic p-modes. The wave amplitude inside the sunspot depends on the photospheric strength of the magnetic field and the distance of the source from the sunspot axis. For the source located at 9 Mm from the center of the sunspot, the wave amplitude increases when the wavefront passes through the central part of the sunspot. For the source distance of 12 Mm, the wave amplitude inside the sunspot is always smaller than outside. For the same source distance from the sunspot center but for the models with different strength of the magnetic field, the wave amplitude inside the sunspot increases with the strength of the magnetic field. The simulations show that unlike the case of the uniform inclined background magnetic field, the p- and f-mode waves are not spatially separated inside the sunspot where the magnetic field is strongly non-uniform. These properties have to be taken into account for interpretation of observations of MHD waves traveling through sunspot regions. ";Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

In order to explain the observed orbit of the third body in V505 Sagittarii and also other observable quantities, namely the minima timings of the eclipsing binary and two different radial velocities in the spectrum, we thoroughly test a fourth-body hypothesis - a perturbation by a dim, yet-unobserved object. We use an N-body numerical integrator to simulate future and past orbital evolution of 3 or 4 components in this system. We construct a suitable chi^2 metric from all available speckle-interferometry, minima-timings and radial-velocity data and we scan a part of a parameter space to get at least some of allowed solutions. In principle, we are able to explain all observable quantities by a presence of a fourth body, but the resulting likelihood of this hypothesis is very low. We also discuss other theoretical explanations of the minima timings variations. Further observations of the minima timings during the next decade or high-resolution spectroscopic data can significantly constrain the model. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

In particular, we investigated the shape of the profile, the radiance distribution and the line shape-to-radiance interrelation. We also compare Ly-a data to co-temporal 1206 Si III data. Results: We find that the average profile of Ly-a has a blue-peak dominance and is more reversed, if the line-of-sight is perpendicular to the field lines. The contrast of Ly-a prominence emission rasters is very low and the radiance distribution differs from the log-normal distribution of the disk. Features seen in the Si III line are not always co-spatial with Ly-a emission. Conclusions: Our empirical results support recent multi-thread models, which predict that asymmetries and depths of the self-reversal depend on the orientation of the prominence axis relative to the line-of-sight. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

However, theoretical predictions of the system's properties seem inconsistent with observations: i. The more massive (primary) component is observed to be cooler than the less massive (secondary) one. ii. The secondary is more luminous (by roughly 10^{24} W) than expected. We study the impact of tidal heating to the energy budget of both components. We also compare various plausible tidal models to determine a range of predicted properties. We apply two versions of two different, well-known models for tidal interaction, respectively, (i.) the 'constant-phase-lag' model and (ii.) the 'constant-time-lag' model, and incorporate the predicted tidal heating into a model of BD structure. We find that the contribution of heat from tides in 2M0535-05 alone may only be large enough to account for the discrepancies between observation and theory in an unlikely region of the parameter space. The tidal quality factor of BDs, Q_{BD}, would have to be 10^{3.5} and the secondary needs a spin-orbit misalignment greater than 50 degrees. However, tidal synchronization time scales for 2M0535-05 restrict the tidal dissipation function Q_{BD} to values greater than 10^{4.5} and rule out intense tidal heating in 2M0535-05. We provide the first constraint on Q_{BD}. Tidal heating alone is unlikely to be responsible for the surprising temperature reversal within 2M0535-05. But an evolutionary embedment of tidal effects and a coupled treatment with the structural evolution of the BDs is necessary to corroborate or refute this result. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)"

A previous study detected infrared excess, indicative of circumstellar dust, in a large population of stars in 47 Tuc, spanning the entire Red Giant Branch (RGB). We show that those results suffered from effects caused by stellar blending and imaging artifacts and that it is likely that no stars below about 1 mag from the tip of the RGB are producing dust. The only stars that appear to harbor dust are variable stars, which are also the coolest and most luminous stars in the cluster. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.1360;Generation of Alfven Waves by Magnetic Reconnection; Hiromitsu Kigure,  Kunio Takahashi,  Kazunari Shibata,  Takaaki Yokoyama,  Satoshi Nozawa;"  In this paper, results of 2.5-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations are reported for the magnetic reconnection of non-perfectly antiparallel magnetic fields. The magnetic field has a component perpendicular to the computational plane, that is, guide field. The angle theta between magnetic field lines in two half regions is a key parameter in our simulations whereas the initial distribution of the plasma is assumed to be simple; density and pressure are uniform except for the current sheet region. Alfven waves are generated at the reconnection point and propagate along the reconnected field line. The energy fluxes of the Alfven waves and magneto-acoustic waves (slow mode and fast mode) generated by the magnetic reconnection are measured. Each flux shows the similar time evolution independent of theta. The percentage of the energies (time integral of energy fluxes) carried by the Alfven waves and magneto-acoustic waves to the released magnetic energy are calculated. The Alfven waves carry 38.9%, 36.0%, and 29.5% of the released magnetic energy at the maximum (theta=80^\circ) in the case of beta=0.1, 1, and 20 respectively, where beta is the plasma beta (the ratio of gas pressure to magnetic pressure). The magneto-acoustic waves carry 16.2% (theta=70^\circ), 25.9% (theta=60^\circ), and 75.0% (theta=180^\circ) of the energy at the maximum. Implications of these results for solar coronal heating and acceleration of high-speed solar wind are discussed. ";Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.1401;Novae With Long-Lasting Supersoft Emission That Drive a High Accretion  Rate; Bradley E. Schaefer,  Andrew C. Collazzi (Louisiana State University);  We identify a new class of novae characterized by the post-eruption quiescent light curve being more than roughly a factor of ten brighter than the pre-eruption light curve. Eight novae (V723 Cas, V1500 Cyg, V1974 Cyg, GQ Mus, CP Pup, T Pyx, V4633 Sgr, and RW UMi) are separated out as being significantly distinct from other novae. This group shares a suite of uncommon properties, characterized by the post-eruption magnitude being much brighter than before eruption, short orbital periods, long-lasting supersoft emission following the eruption, a highly magnetized white dwarf, and secular declines during the post-eruption quiescence. We present a basic physical picture which shows why all five uncommon properties are causally connected. Most novae do not have adequate accretion for continuous hydrogen burning, but some can achieve this if the companion star is nearby (with short orbital period) and a magnetic field channels the matter onto a small area on the white dwarf so as to produce a locally high accretion rate. The resultant supersoft flux irradiates the companion star and drives a higher accretion rate (with a brighter post-eruption phase), which serves to keep the hydrogen burning and the supersoft flux going. The feedback loop cannot be perfectly self-sustaining, so the supersoft flux will decline over time, forcing a decline in the accretion rate and the system brightness. We name this new group after the prototype, V1500 Cyg. V1500 Cyg stars are definitely not progenitors of Type Ia supernovae. The V1500 Cyg stars have similar physical mechanisms and appearances as predicted for nova by the hibernation model, but with this group accounting for only 14% of novae. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.1452;The first galactic stars and chemical enrichment in the halo; Piercarlo Bonifacio (CIFIST, Gepi, Oat);"  The cosmic microwave background and the cosmic expansion can be interpreted as evidence that the Universe underwent an extremely hot and dense phase about 14 Gyr ago. The nucleosynthesis computations tell us that the Universe emerged from this state with a very simple chemical composition: H, 2H, 3He, 4He, and traces of 7Li. All other nuclei where synthesised at later times. Our stellar evolution models tell us that, if a low-mass star with this composition had been created (a ""zero-metal"" star) at that time, it would still be shining on the Main Sequence today. Over the last 40 years there have been many efforts to detect such primordial stars but none has so-far been found. The lowest metallicity stars known have a metal content, Z, which is of the order of 10e-4Z_Sun. These are also the lowest metallicity objects known in the Universe. This seems to support the theories of star formation which predict that only high mass stars could form with a primordial composition and require a minimum metallicity to allow the formation of low-mass stars. Yet, since absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, we cannot exclude the existence of such low-mass zero-metal stars, at present. If we have not found the first Galactic stars, as a by product of our searches we have found their direct descendants, stars of extremely low metallicity (Z<=10e-3Z_Sun). The chemical composition of such stars contains indirect information on the nature of the stars responsible for the nucleosynthesis of the metals. Such a fossil record allows us a glimpse of the Galaxy at a look-back time equivalent to redshift z=10, or larger. The last ten years have been full of exciting discoveries in this field, which I will try to review in this contribution. ";Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.1525;Planetary Nebulae: Observational Properties, Mimics, and Diagnostics; David J. Frew,  Quentin A. Parker;  The total number of true, likely and possible planetary nebulae (PN) now known in the Milky Way is nearly 3000, double the number known a decade ago. The new discoveries are a legacy of the recent availability of wide field, narrowband imaging surveys, primarily in the light of H-alpha. In this paper, we summarise the various PN discovery techniques, and give an overview of the many types of objects which mimic PN and which appear as contaminants in both Galactic and extragalactic samples. Much improved discrimination of classical PN from their mimics is now possible based on the wide variety of high-quality multiwavelength data sets that are now available. We offer improved taxonomic and observational definitions for the PN phenomenon based on evaluation of these better diagnostic capabilities. However, we note that evidence is increasing that the PN phenomenon is heterogeneous, and PN are likely to be formed from multiple evolutionary scenarios. In particular, the relationships between some collimated symbiotic outflows and bipolar PN remain uncertain. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Our analysis suggests the presence of a magnetic complexity zone with a mean field strength <B> > 30 G lying just below the sudden transition region to the coronal temperatures. The chromospheric plasma directly underneath is very weakly magnetized, with <B> ~ 1 G. The possible existence of this abrupt change in the degree of magnetization of the upper chromosphere of the quiet Sun might have large significance for our understanding of chromospheric (and, therefore, coronal) heating. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Brown;"  We present a deep optical/near-infrared imaging survey of the Serpens molecular cloud. This survey constitutes the complementary optical data to the Spitzer ""Core To Disk"" (c2d) Legacy survey in this cloud. The survey was conducted using the Wide Field Camera at the Isaac Newton Telescope. About 0.96 square degrees were imaged in the R and Z filters, covering the entire region where most of the young stellar objects identified by the c2d survey are located. 26524 point-like sources were detected in both R and Z bands down to R=24.5 mag and Z=23 mag with a signal-to-noise ratio better than 3. The 95% completeness limit of our catalog corresponds to 0.04 solar masses for members of the Serpens star forming region (age 2 Myr and distance 260 pc) in the absence of extinction. Adopting the typical extinction of the observed area (Av=7 mag), we estimate a 95% completeness level down to 0.1 solar masses. The astrometric accuracy of our catalog is 0.4 arcsec with respect to the 2MASS catalog. Our final catalog contains J2000 celestial coordinates, magnitudes in the R and Z bands calibrated to the SDSS photometric system and, where possible, JHK magnitudes from 2MASS for sources in 0.96 square degrees in the direction of Serpens. This data product has been already used within the frame of the c2d Spitzer Legacy Project analysis in Serpens to study the star/disk formation and evolution in this cloud; here we use it to obtain new indications of the disk-less population in Serpens.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.1609;Dynamism in the solar core; Attila Grandpierre;  Recent results of a mixed shell model heated asymmetrically by transient increases in nuclear burning indicate the transient generation of small hot spots inside the Sun somewhere between 0.1 and 0.2 solar radii. These hot bubbles are followed by a nonlinear differential equation system with finite amplitude non-homologous perturbations which is solved in a solar model. Our results show the possibility of a direct connection between the dynamic phenomena of the solar core and the atmospheric activity. Namely, an initial heating about DQ_0 ~ 10^{31}-10^{37} ergs can be enough for a bubble to reach the outer convective zone. Our calculations show that a hot bubble can arrive into subphotospheric regions with DQ_final ~ 10^{28} - 10^{34} ergs with a high speed, up to 10 km s-1, approaching the local sound speed. We point out that the developing sonic boom transforms the shock front into accelerated particle beam injected upwards into the top of loop carried out by the hot bubble above its forefront traveling from the solar interior. As a result, a new perspective arises to explain flare energetics. We show that the particle beams generated by energetic deep-origin hot bubbles in the subphotospheric layers have masses, energies, and chemical compositions in the observed range of solar chromospheric and coronal flares. It is shown how the emergence of a hot bubble into subphotospheric regions offers a natural mechanism that can generate both the eruption leading to the flare and the observed coronal magnetic topology for reconnection. We show a list of long-standing problems of solar physics that our model explains. We present some predictions for observations, some of which are planned to be realized in the near future. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.1638;Tau Boo b: Hunting for reflected starlight; F. Rodler,  M. Kuerster,  T. Henning;  Aims. We attempt to detect starlight reflected from the hot Jupiter orbiting the main-sequence star Tau Boo, in order to determine the albedo of the planetary atmosphere, the orbital inclination of the planetary system and the exact mass of the planetary companion. Methods. We analyze high-precision, high-resolution spectra, collected over two half nights using UVES at the VLT/UT2, by way of data synthesis. We interpret our data using two different atmospheric models for hot Jupiters. Results. Although a weak candidate signal appears near the most probable radial velocity amplitude, its statistical significance is insufficient for us to claim a detection. However, this feature agrees very well with a completely independently obtained result by another research group, which searched for reflected light from Tau Boo b. As a consequence of the non-detection of reflected light, we place upper limits to the planet-to-star flux ratio at the 99.9% significance level. For the most probable orbital inclination around i = 46 degrees, we can limit the relative reflected radiation to be less than 5.7 x 10^-5 for grey albedo. This implies a geometric albedo smaller than 0.40, assuming a planetary radius of 1.2 R_Jup . ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Bisikalo (2) ((1) Institute of Astronomy, Bulgarian Academy of Science, National Astronomical Observatory Rozhen, (2) Institute of Astronomy of the Russian Academy of Science);  High resolution observations in the region of the lines Halpha, He II 4686 and Hgamma of the spectrum of the symbiotic binary Z And were performed during its small-amplitude brightening at the end of 2002. The profiles of the hydrogen lines were double-peaked. These profiles give a reason to suppose that the lines can be emitted mainly by an optically thin accretion disc. The Halpha line is strongly contaminated by the emission of the envelope, therefore for consideration of accretion disc properties we use the Hgamma line. The Halpha line had broad wings which are supposed to be determined mostly from radiation damping but high velocity stellar wind from the compact object in the system can also contribute to their appearance. The Hgamma line had a broad emission component which is assumed to be emitted mainly from the inner part of the accretion disc. The line He II 4686 had a broad emission component too, but it is supposed to appear in a region of a high velocity stellar wind. The outer radius of the accretion disc can be calculated from the shift between the peaks. Assuming, that the orbit inclination can ranges from 47$^\circ$ to 76$^\circ$, we estimate the outer radius as 20 - 50 R_sun. The behaviour of the observed lines can be considered in the framework of the model proposed for interpretation of the line spectrum during the major 2000 - 2002 brightening of this binary. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Cornide;  Aims: We present a compilation of spectroscopic data from a survey of 144 chromospherically active young stars in the solar neighborhood which may be used to investigate different aspects of the formation and evolution of the solar neighborhood in terms of kinematics and stellar formation history. The data have already been used by us in several studies. With this paper, we make all these data accessible to the scientific community for future studies on different topics. Methods: We performed spectroscopic observations with echelle spectrographs to cover the entirety of the optical spectral range simultaneously. Standard data reduction was performed with the IRAF ECHELLE package. We applied the spectral subtraction technique to reveal chromospheric emission in the stars of the sample. The equivalent width of chromospheric emission lines was measured in the subtracted spectra and then converted to fluxes using equivalent width-flux relationships. Radial and rotational velocities were determined by the cross-correlation technique. Kinematics, equivalent widths of the lithium line 6707.8 angstroms and spectral types were also determined. Results: A catalog of spectroscopic data is compiled: radial and rotational velocities, space motion, equivalent widths of optical chromospheric activity indicators from Ca II H & K to the calcium infrared triplet and the lithium line in 6708 angstroms. Fluxes in the chromospheric emission lines and R'HK are also determined for each observation of star in the sample. We used these data to investigate the emission levels of our stars. The study of the Halpha emission line revealed the presence of two different populations of chromospheric emitters in the sample, clearly separated in the log F(Halpha)/Fbol - (V-J) diagram. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Ludwig,  L. Sbordone,  J.I. González Hernández,  E. Caffau;  The origin of carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars enriched with both s and r elements is highly debated. Detailed abundances of these types of stars are crucial to understand the nature of their progenitors. The aim of this investigation is to study in detail the abundances of SDSS J1349-0229, SDSS J0912+0216 and SDSS J1036+1212, three dwarf CEMP stars, selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Using high resolution VLT/UVES spectra (R ~ 30 000) we determine abundances for Li, C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Ca, Sc, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni and 21 neutron-capture elements. We made use of CO^5BOLD 3D hydrodynamical model atmospheres in the analysis of the carbon, nitrogen and oxygen abundances. NLTE corrections for C I and O I lines were computed using the Kiel code. We classify SDSS J1349-0229 and SDSS J0912+0216 as CEMP-r+s stars. SDSS J1036+1212 belongs to the class CEMP-no/s, with enhanced Ba, but deficient Sr, of which it is the third member discovered to date. Radial-velocity variations have been observed in SDSS J1349-0229, providing evidence that it is a member of a binary system. The chemical composition of the three stars is generally compatible with mass transfer from an AGB companion. However, many details remain difficult to explain. Most notably of those are the abundance of Li at the level of the Spite plateau in SDSS J1036+1212 and the large over-abundance of the pure r-process element Eu in all three stars. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.1675;Coronal hole boundaries evolution at small scales: II. XRT view Can  small-scale outflows at CHBs be a source of the slow solar wind?; S. Subramanian,  M. S. Madjarska,  J. G. Doyle;"  We developed an automated procedure for the identification of transient brightenings in images from the X-ray telescope on-board Hinode taken with an Al Poly filter in the equatorial coronal holes, polar coronal holes, and the quiet Sun with and without transient coronal holes. We found that in comparison to the quiet Sun, the boundaries of coronal holes are abundant with brightening events including areas inside the coronal holes where closed magnetic field structures are present. The visual analysis of these brightenings revealed that around 70% of them in equatorial, polar and transient coronal holes and their boundaries show expanding loop structures and/or collimated outflows. In the quiet Sun only 30% of the brightenings show flows with most of them appearing to be contained in the solar corona by closed magnetic field lines. This strongly suggests that magnetic reconnection of co-spatial open and closed magnetic field lines creates the necessary conditions for plasma outflows to large distances. The ejected plasma always originates from pre-existing or newly emerging (at X-ray temperatures) bright points. The present study confirms our findings that the evolution of loop structures known as coronal bright points is associated with the small-scale changes of coronal hole boundaries. The loop structures show an expansion and eruption with the trapped plasma consequently escaping along the ""quasi"" open magnetic field lines. These ejections appear to be triggered by magnetic reconnection, e.g. the so-called interchange reconnection between the closed magnetic field lines (BPs) and the open magnetic field lines of the coronal holes. We suggest that these plasma outflows are possibly one of the sources of the slow solar wind. ";Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Lee;  Low and mid-latitude coronal holes (CHs) observed on the Sun during the current solar activity minimum (from September 21, 2006, Carrington rotation (CR) 2048, until June 26, 2009 (CR 2084)) were analyzed using {\it SOHO}/EIT and STEREO-A SECCHI EUVI data. From both the observations and Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) modeling, we find that the area occupied by CHs inside a belt of $\pm 40^\circ$ around the solar equator is larger in the current 2007 solar minimum relative to the similar phase of the previous 1996 solar minimum. The enhanced CH area is related to a recurrent appearance of five persistent CHs, which survived during 7-27 solar rotations. Three of the CHs are of positive magnetic polarity and two are negative. The most long-lived CH was being formed during 2 days and existed for 27 rotations. This CH was associated with fast solar wind at 1 AU of approximately 620$\pm 40$ km s$^{-1}$. The 3D MHD modeling for this time period shows an open field structure above this CH. We conclude that the global magnetic field of the Sun possessed a multi-pole structure during this time period. Calculation of the harmonic power spectrum of the solar magnetic field demonstrates a greater prevalence of multi-pole components over the dipole component in the 2007 solar minimum compared to the 1996 solar minimum. The unusual large separation between the dipole and multi-pole components is due to the very low magnitude of the dipole component, which is three times lower than that in the previous 1996 solar minimum. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Leibacher;  We investigate the behavior of the intermediate-degree mode frequencies of the sun during the current extended minimum phase to explore the time-varying conditions in the solar interior. Using contemporaneous helioseismic data from GONG and MDI, we find that the changes in resonant mode frequencies during the activity minimum period are significantly greater than the changes in solar activity as measured by different proxies. We detect a seismic minimum in MDI p-mode frequency shifts during 2008 July--August but no such signature is seen in mean shifts computed from GONG frequencies. We also analyze the frequencies of individual oscillation modes from GONG data as a function of latitude and observe a signature of the onset of the solar cycle 24 in early 2009. Thus the intermediate degree modes do not confirm the onset of the cycle 24 during late 2007 as reported from the analysis of the low-degree GOLF frequencies. Further, both the GONG and MDI frequencies show a surprising anti-correlation between frequencies and activity proxies during the current minimum, in contrast to the behavior during the minimum between cycles 22 and 23. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Traditionally, DAVs that have been analyzed asteroseismologically have had fewer than half a dozen modes. Such a large number of modes presents a special challenge to white dwarf asteroseismology, but at the same time has the potential to yield a detailed picture of the interior chemical make-up of DAVs.We explore this possibility by varying the core profiles as well as the layer masses.We use an iterative grid search approach to find best fit models for G38-29 and R808 and comment on some of the intricacies of fine grid searches in white dwarf asteroseismology. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.1761;Does GD 356 have a Terrestrial Planetary Companion?; Dayal T. Wickramasinghe,  Jay Farihi,  Christopher A. Tout,  Lilia Ferrario,  Richard J. Stancliffe;  GD 356 is unique among magnetic white dwarfs because it shows Zeeman-split Balmer lines in pure emission. The lines originate from a region of nearly uniform field strength (delta B/B is approximately 0.1) that covers 10 per cent of the stellar surface in which there is a temperature inversion. The energy source that heats the photosphere remains a mystery but it is likely to be associated with the presence of a companion. Based on current models we use archival Spitzer IRAC observations to place a new and stringent upper limit of 12 Jupiter masses for the mass of such a companion. In the light of this result and the recent discovery of a 115 min photometric period for GD 356, we exclude previous models that invoke accretion and revisit the unipolar inductor model that has been proposed for this system. In this model a highly conducting planet with a metallic core orbits the magnetic white dwarf and, as it cuts through field lines, a current is set flowing between the two bodies. This current dissipates in the photosphere of the white dwarf and causes a temperature inversion. Such a planet is unlikely to have survived the RGB/AGB phases of evolution so we argue that it may have formed from the circumstellar disc of a disrupted He or CO core during a rare merger of two white dwarfs. GD 356 would then be a white dwarf counterpart of the millisecond binary pulsar PSR 1257+12 which is known to host a planetary system. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.1848;The Nature of the Hyper-Runaway Candidate HIP 60350; Andreas Irrgang,  Norbert Przybilla,  Ulrich Heber,  M. Fernanda Nieva,  Sonja Schuh;  Young, massive stars in the Galactic halo are widely supposed to be the result of an ejection event from the Galactic disk forcing some stars to leave their place of birth as so-called runaway stars. Here, we present a detailed spectroscopic and kinematic analysis of the runaway B-star HIP 60350 to determine which runaway scenario - a supernova explosion disrupting a binary system or dynamical interaction in star clusters - may be responsible for HIP 60350's peculiar orbit. Based on a non-local thermodynamic equilibrium approach, a high-resolution optical echelle spectrum was examined to revise spectroscopic quantities and for the first time to perform a differential chemical abundance analysis with respect to the B-type star 18 Peg. The results together with proper motions from the Hipparcos Catalog further allowed the three-dimensional kinematics of the star to be studied numerically. The abundances derived for HIP 60350 are consistent with a slightly supersolar metallicity agreeing with the kinematically predicted place of birth ca. 6 kpc away from the Galactic center. However, they do not exclude the possibility of an alpha-enhanced abundance pattern expected in the case of the supernova scenario. Its outstanding high Galactic rest frame velocity of 530 plus-minus 35 km/s is a consequence of ejection in the direction of Galactic rotation and slightly exceeds the local Galactic escape velocity in a standard Galactic potential. Hence HIP 60350 may be unbound to the Galaxy. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Furthermore, we aimed for atmospheric models which are able to quantitatively reproduce line profile variations found in observed spectra of pulsating late-type giants. Models describing pulsation-enhanced dust-driven winds were used to compute synthetic spectra under the assumptions of chemical equilibrium and LTE and by solving the radiative transfer in spherical geometry including velocity effects. Radial velocities derived from Doppler-shifted synthetic line profiles provide information on the gas velocities in the line-forming region of the spectral features. On the basis of dynamic models we investigated in detail the finding that various molecular features in AGB spectra originate at different geometrical depths of the very extended atmospheres. We show that the models are able to quantitatively reproduce the characteristic line profile variations of lines sampling the deep photosphere. The global velocity fields of typical LPVs are also realistically reproduced. Possible reasons for discrepancies concerning other modelling results are outlined. In addition, we present a model showing variations of CO dv=3 line profiles comparable to observed spectra of SRVs and discuss that the non-occurence of line doubling in these objects may be due to a density effect. The results of our line profile modelling are another indication that the dynamic models studied here are approaching a realistic representation of the outer layers of AGB stars. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Eiroa;"  Context: According to theory, high-energy emission from the coronae of cool stars can severely erode the atmospheres of orbiting planets. No observational tests of the long term effects of erosion have yet been made. Aims: To analyze the current distribution of planetary mass with X-ray irradiation of the atmospheres in order to make an observational assessment of the effects of erosion by coronal radiation. Methods: We study a large sample of planet-hosting stars with XMM-Newton, Chandra and ROSAT; make a careful identification of X-ray counterparts; and fit their spectra to make accurately measurements of the stellar X-ray flux. Results: The distribution of the planetary masses with X-ray flux suggests that erosion has taken place: most surviving massive planets, (M_p sin i >1.5 M_J), have been exposed to lower accumulated irradiation. Heavy erosion during the initial stages of stellar evolution is followed by a phase of much weaker erosion. A line dividing these two phases could be present, showing a strong dependence on planet mass. Although a larger sample will be required to establish a well-defined erosion line, the distribution found is very suggestive. Conclusions: The distribution of planetary mass with X-ray flux is consistent with a scenario in which planet atmospheres have suffered the effects of erosion by coronal X-ray and EUV emission. The erosion line is an observational constraint to models of atmospheric erosion. ";"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)"

Gizon;  In local helioseismology numerical simulations of wave propagation are useful to model the interaction of solar waves with perturbations to a background solar model. However, the solution to the equations of motions include convective modes that can swamp the waves we are interested in. For this reason, we choose to first stabilise the background solar model against convection by altering the vertical pressure gradient. Here we compare the eigenmodes of our convectively stabilised model with a standard solar model (Model S) and find a good agreement. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Fusi Pecci (1),  E. Oliva (2) ((1)INAF - Osservatorio Astronomico di Bologna, (2) INAF - Osservatorio Astrofisico di Arcetri, Firenze, Italy);"  We have investigated the relevant trend of the bolometric correction (BC) at the cool-temperature regime of red giant stars and its possible dependence on stellar metallicity. Our analysis relies on a wide sample of optical-infrared spectroscopic observations, along the 3500A-2.5micron wavelength range, for a grid of 92 red giant stars in five (3 globular + 2 open) Galactic clusters, along the -2.2<[Fe/H]<+0.4 metallicity range. Bolometric magnitudes have been found within an internal accuracy of a few percent. Making use of our new database, we provide a set of fitting functions for the V and K BC vs. Teff and broad-band colors, valid over the interval 3300K<Teff<5000K, especially suited for Red Giants. No evident drift of both BC(V) and BC(K) with [Fe/H] is found. Things may be different, however, for the B-band correction, given a clear (B-V) vs. [Fe/H] correlation in place for our data, with metal-poor stars displaying a ""bluer"" (B-V) with respect to the metal-rich sample, for fixed Teff. Our empirical bolometric scale supports the conclusion that (a) BC(K) from the most recent studies are reliable within <0.1 mag over the whole color/temperature range considered in this paper, and (b) the same conclusion apply to BC(V) only for stars warmer than ~3800K. At cooler temperatures the agreement is less general, and MARCS models are the only ones providing a satisfactory match to observations.

The interaction between the two flux systems generates a localised current sheet where MHD reconnection takes place. We investigate how efficiently the reconnection region accelerates charged particles and what kind of energy distribution they acquire. The particle tracing is done numerically using the Guiding Center Approximation on individual data sets from the numerical MHD experiment. We derive particle and implied photon distribution functions having power law forms, and look at the impact patterns of particles hitting the photosphere. We find that particles reach energies far in excess of those seen in observations of solar flares. However the structure of the impact region in the photosphere gives a good representation of the topological structure of the magnetic field. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.1993;The light elements in the light of 3D and non-LTE effects; Martin Asplund,  Karin Lind;  In this review we discuss possible systematic errors inherent in classical 1D LTE abundance analyses of late-type stars for the light elements (here: H, He, Li, Be and B). The advent of realistic 3D hydrodynamical model atmospheres and the availability of non-LTE line formation codes place the stellar analyses on a much firmer footing and indeed drastically modify the astrophysical interpretations in many cases, especially at low metallicities. For the Teff-sensitive hydrogen lines both stellar granulation and non-LTE are likely important but the combination of the two has not yet been fully explored. A fortuitous near-cancellation of significant but opposite 3D and non-LTE effects leaves the derived 7Li abundances largely unaffected but new atomic collisional data should be taken into account. We also discuss the impact on 3D non-LTE line formation on the estimated lithium isotopic abundances in halo stars in light of recent claims that convective line asymmetries can mimic the presence of 6Li. While Be only have relatively minor non-LTE abundance corrections, B is sensitive even if the latest calculations imply smaller non-LTE effects than previously thought. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.2003;The Effect of Star Spots on Accurate Radius Determination of the Low  Mass Double-lined Eclipsing Binary GU Boo; G. Windmiller,  J. A. Orosz,  P. B. Etzel;  GU Boo is one of only a relatively small number of well studied double-lined eclipsing binaries that contain low-mass stars. L'opez-Morales & Ribas (2005, hereafter LR05) present a comprehensive analysis of multi-color light and radial velocity curves for this system. The GU Boo light curves presented in LR05 had substantial asymmetries, which were attributed to large spots. In spite of the asymmetry LR05 derived masses and radii accurate to about 2%. We obtained additional photometry of GU Boo using both a CCD and a single-channel photometer and modeled the light curves with the ELC software to determine if the large spots in the light curves give rise to systematic errors at the few percent level. We also modeled the original light curves from LR05 using models with and without spots. We derived a radius of the primary of 0.6329 +- 0.0026 Solar-Radii, 0.6413 +- 0.0049 SR, and 0.6373 +- 0.0029 SR from the CCD, photoelectric, and LR05 data, respectively. Each of these measurements agrees with the value reported by LR05 (R1=0.623 +- 0.016 SR) at the level of about 2%. In addition, the spread in these values is about 1-2% from the mean. For the secondary, we derive radii of 0.6074 +- 0.0035 SR, 0.5944 +- 0.0069 SR, and 0.5976 +- 0.0059 SR from the three respective data sets. The LR05 value is R2=0.620 +- 0.020 SR, which is about 2-3% larger than each of the three values we found. The spread in these values is about 2% from the mean. The systematic difference between our three determinations of the secondary radius and that of LR05 might be attributed to differences in the modelling process and codes used. Our own fits suggest that, for GU Boo at least, using accurate spot modelling of a single set of multicolor light curves results in radii determinations accurate at the 2% level. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Williams;"  We measure apparent velocities (v_app) of the Halpha and Hbeta Balmer line cores for 449 non-binary thin disk normal DA white dwarfs (WDs) using optical spectra taken for the ESO SN Ia Progenitor surveY (SPY; Napiwotzki et al. 2001). Assuming these WDs are nearby and co-moving, we correct our velocities to the Local Standard of Rest so that the remaining stellar motions are random. By averaging over the sample, we are left with the mean gravitational redshift, <v_g>: we find <v_g> = <v_app> = 32.57 +/- 1.17 km/s. Using the mass-radius relation from evolutionary models, this translates to a mean mass of 0.647 +0.013 -0.014 Msun. We interpret this as the mean mass for all DAs. Our results are in agreement with previous gravitational redshift studies but are significantly higher than all previous spectroscopic determinations except the recent findings of Tremblay & Bergeron (2009). Since the gravitational redshift method is independent of surface gravity from atmosphere models, we investigate the mean mass of DAs with spectroscopic Teff both above and below 12000 K; fits to line profiles give a rapid increase in the mean mass with decreasing Teff. Our results are consistent with no significant change in mean mass: <M>^hot = 0.640 +/- 0.014 Msun and <M>^cool = 0.686 +0.035 -0.039 Msun. ";Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

The main aim of these monitoring observations is to study spectral variabilities in the Be disc, on both the short (a week or so) and long (more than hundreds of days) timescales, by taking long-term frequent observations. Our four-year spectroscopic observations indicate that the V/R ratio, i.e., the relative intensity of the violet (V) peak to the red (R) one, of the double-peaked H-alpha line profile varies with a period of 500 days. The H-beta line profile also varies in phase with the H-alpha profile. With these observations covering two full cycles of the V/R variability, we reconstruct the 2-D structure of the Be disc by applying the Doppler tomography method to the H-alpha and H-beta emission line profiles, using a rigidly rotating frame with the V/R variability period. The resulting disc structure reveals non-axisymmetric features, which can be explained by a one-armed perturbation in the Be disc. It is the first time that an eccentric disc structure is directly detected by using a method other than the interferometric one. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Zoccali;  We present new empirical estimates of the Delta V_HB_bump parameter for 15 Galactic globular clusters (GGCs) using accurate and homogeneous ground-based optical data. Together with similar evaluations available in the literature, we ended up with a sample of 62 GGCs covering a very broad range in metal content (-2.16<=[M/H]<=-0.58 dex). Adopting the homogeneous metallicity scale provided either by Kraft & Ivans (2004) or by Carretta et al. (2009), we found that the observed Delta V_HB_bump parameters are larger than predicted. In the metal-poor regime ([M/H]<=-1.7, -1.6 dex) 40% of GCs show discrepancies of 2sigma (~0.40 mag) or more. Evolutionary models that account either for alpha- and CNO-enhancement or for helium enhancement do not alleviate the discrepancy between theory and observations. The outcome is the same if we use the new Solar heavy-element mixture. The comparison between alpha- and CNO-enhanced evolutionary models and observations in the Carretta et al. metallicity scale also indicates that observed Delta V_HB_bump parameters, in the metal-rich regime ([M/H]=>0), might be systematically smaller than predicted. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.2083;First Stars. I. Evolution without mass loss; D. Bahena,  J. Klapp;"  The first generation of stars was formed from primordial gas. Numerical simulations suggest that the first stars were predominantly very massive, with typical masses M > 100 Mo. These stars were responsible for the reionization of the universe, the initial enrichment of the intergalactic medium with heavy elements, and other cosmological consequences. In this work, we study the structure of Zero Age Main Sequence stars for a wide mass and metallicity range and the evolution of 100, 150, 200, 250 and 300 Mo galactic and pregalactic Pop III very massive stars without mass loss, with metallicity Z=10E-6 and 10E-9, respectively. Using a stellar evolution code, a system of 10 equations together with boundary conditions are solved simultaneously. For the change of chemical composition, which determines the evolution of a star, a diffusion treatment for convection and semiconvection is used. A set of 30 nuclear reactions are solved simultaneously with the stellar structure and evolution equations. Several results on the main sequence, and during the hydrogen and helium burning phases, are described. Low metallicity massive stars are hotter and more compact and luminous than their metal enriched counterparts. Due to their high temperatures, pregalactic stars activate sooner the triple alpha reaction self-producing their own heavy elements. Both galactic and pregalactic stars are radiation pressure dominated and evolve below the Eddington luminosity limit with short lifetimes. The physical characteristics of the first stars have an important influence in predictions of the ionizing photon yields from the first luminous objects; also they develop large convective cores with important helium core masses which are important for explosion calculations.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.2121;On the importance of background subtraction in the analysis of coronal  loops observed with TRACE; S.Terzo,  F.Reale;  In the framework of TRACE coronal observations, we compare the analysis and diagnostics of a loop after subtracting the background with two different and independent methods. The dataset includes sequences of images in the 171 A, 195 A filter bands of TRACE. One background subtraction method consists in taking as background values those obtained from interpolation between concentric strips around the analyzed loop. The other method is a pixel-to-pixel subtraction of the final image when the loop had completely faded out, already used by Reale & Ciaravella 2006. We compare the emission distributions along the loop obtained with the two methods and find that they are considerably different. We find differences as well in the related derive filter ratio and temperature profiles. In particular, the pixel-to-pixel subtraction leads to coherent diagnostics of a cooling loop. With the other subtraction the diagnostics are much less clear. The background subtraction is a delicate issue in the analysis of a loop. The pixel-to-pixel subtraction appears to be more reliable, but its application is not always possible. Subtraction from interpolation between surrounding regions can produce higher systematic errors, because of intersecting structures and of the large amount of subtracted emission in TRACE observations. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

To ensure that the accuracy of the computed frequencies is of the same order of magnitude or better than the observational errors, some requirements in the equilibrium models and the numerical resolutions of the pulsational equations must be followed. In particular, we have verified the numerical accuracy obtained with the Saclay seismic model, which is used to study the solar g-mode region (60 to 140$\mu$Hz). We have compared the results coming from the Aarhus adiabatic pulsation code (ADIPLS), with the frequencies computed with the Granada Code (GraCo) taking into account several possible choices. We have concluded that the present equilibrium models and the use of the Richardson extrapolation ensure an accuracy of the order of $0.01 \mu Hz$ in the determination of the frequencies, which is quite enough for our purposes.

During the coordinated observation, 9 chromospheric anemone jets were simultaneously observed with the two instruments. These observations revealed three important features, i.e.: (1) the jets are generated in the lower chromosphere, (2) the length and lifetime of the jets are 0.4-5 Mm and 40-320 sec, (3) the apparent velocity of the jets with Hinode SOT are 3-24 km/s, while Ca II K3 component at the jets show blueshifts (in 5 events) in the range of 2- 6 km/s. The chromospheric anemone jets are associated with mixed polarity regions which are either small emerging flux regions or moving magnetic features. It is found that the Ca II K line often show red or blue asymmetry in K2/K1 component: the footpoint of the jets associated with emerging flux regions often show redshift (2-16 km/s), while the one with moving magnetic features show blueshift (around 5 km/s). Detailed analysis of magnetic evolution of the jet foaming regions revealed that the reconnection rate (or canceling rate) of the total magnetic flux at the footpoint of the jets are of order of 10^{16} Mx/s, and the resulting magnetic energy release rate (1.1-10) x 10^{24} erg/s, with the total energy release (1-13) x 10^{26} erg for the duration of the magnetic cancellations, 130s. These are comparable to the estimated total energy, 10^{26} erg, in a single chromospheric anemone jet. An observation-based physical model of the jet is presented. The relation between chromospheric anemone jets and Ellerman bombs is discussed. ";Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Thielemann;  The nucleosynthetic characteristics of various explosion mechanisms of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is explored based on three two-dimensional explosion simulations representing extreme cases: a pure turbulent deflagration, a delayed detonation following an approximately spherical ignition of the initial deflagration, and a delayed detonation arising from a highly asymmetric deflagration ignition. Apart from this initial condition, the deflagration stage is treated in a parameter-free approach. The detonation is initiated when the turbulent burning enters the distributed burning regime. This occurs at densities around $10^{7}$ g cm$^{-3}$ -- relatively low as compared to existing nucleosynthesis studies for one-dimensional spherically symmetric models. The burning in these multidimensional models is different from that in one-dimensional simulations as the detonation wave propagates both into unburned material in the high density region near the center of a white dwarf and into the low density region near the surface. Thus, the resulting yield is a mixture of different explosive burning products, from carbon-burning products at low densities to complete silicon-burning products at the highest densities, as well as electron-capture products synthesized at the deflagration stage. In contrast to the deflagration model, the delayed detonations produce a characteristic layered structure and the yields largely satisfy constraints from Galactic chemical evolution. In the asymmetric delayed detonation model, the region filled with electron capture species (e.g., $^{58}$Ni, $^{54}$Fe) is within a shell, showing a large off-set, above the bulk of $^{56}$Ni distribution, while species produced by the detonation are distributed more spherically (abridged). ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)"

Sim,  M. Kromer;  The explosion of sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs via the double detonation scenario is a potential explanation for type Ia supernovae. In this scenario, a surface detonation in a helium layer initiates a detonation in the underlying carbon/oxygen core leading to an explosion. For a given core mass, a lower bound has been determined on the mass of the helium shell required for dynamical burning during a helium flash, which is a necessary prerequisite for detonation. For a range of core and corresponding minimum helium shell masses, we investigate whether an assumed surface helium detonation is capable of triggering a subsequent detonation in the core even for this limiting case. We carried out hydrodynamic simulations on a co-expanding Eulerian grid in two dimensions assuming rotational symmetry. The detonations are propagated using the level-set approach and a simplified scheme for nuclear reactions that has been calibrated with a large nuclear network. The same network is used to determine detailed nucleosynthetic abundances in a post-processing step. Based on approximate detonation initiation criteria in the literature, we find that secondary core detonations are triggered for all of the simulated models, ranging in core mass from 0.810 up to 1.385 M_solar with corresponding shell masses from 0.126 down to 0.0035 M_solar. This implies that, as soon as a detonation triggers in a helium shell covering a carbon/oxygen white dwarf, a subsequent core detonation is virtually inevitable. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

However, such coronal jets are not only a specific features of polar coronal holes but they can also be found in coronal holes appearing at lower heliographic latitudes. In this paper we present some observations of ""equatorial coronal hole jets"" made up with data provided by the STEREO/SECCHI instruments during a period comprising March 2007 and December 2007. The jet events are selected by requiring at least some visibility in both COR1 and EUVI instruments. We report 15 jet events, and we discuss their main features. For one event, the uplift velocity has been determined as about 200 km/s, while the deceleration rate appears to be about 0.11 km/s2, less than solar gravity. The average jet visibility time is about 30 minutes, consistent with jet observed in polar regions. On the basis of the present dataset, we provisionally conclude that there are not substantial physical differences between polar and equatorial coronal hole jets.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.2212;Line-profile variations of stochastically excited oscillations in four  evolved stars; S. Hekker,  C. Aerts;  Since solar-like oscillations were first detected in red-giant stars, the presence of non-radial oscillation modes has been debated. Spectroscopic line-profile analysis was used in the first attempt to perform mode identification, which revealed that non-radial modes are observable. Despite the fact that the presence of non-radial modes could be confirmed, the degree or azimuthal order could not be uniquely identified. Here we present an improvement to this first spectroscopic line-profile analysis. Aims: We aim to study line-profile variations of stochastically excited solar-like oscillations in four evolved stars to derive the azimuthal order of the observed mode and the surface rotational frequency. Methods: Spectroscopic line-profile analysis is applied to cross-correlation functions, using the Fourier Parameter Fit method on the amplitude and phase distributions across the profiles. Results: For four evolved stars, beta Hydri (G2IV), epsilon Ophiuchi (G9.5III), eta Serpentis (K0III) and delta Eridani (K0IV) the line-profile variations reveal the azimuthal order of the oscillations with an accuracy of ~1. Furthermore, our analysis reveals the projected rotational velocity and the inclination angle. From these parameters we obtain the surface rotational frequency. Conclusions: We conclude that line-profile variations of cross-correlation functions behave differently for different frequencies and that they provide additional information in terms of the surface rotational frequency and azimuthal order. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM)"

Ibgui,  J. Goodman,  A. Burrows;  The presence of a close, low-mass companion is thought to play a substantial and perhaps necessary role in shaping post-Asymptotic Giant Branch and Planetary Nebula outflows. During post-main-sequence evolution, radial expansion of the primary star, accompanied by intense winds, can significantly alter the binary orbit via tidal dissipation and mass loss. To investigate this, we couple stellar evolution models (from the zero-age main-sequence through the end of the post-main sequence) to a tidal evolution code. The binary's fate is determined by the initial masses of the primary and the companion, the initial orbit (taken to be circular), and the Reimers mass-loss parameter. For a range of these parameters, we determine whether the orbit expands due to mass loss or decays due to tidal torques. Where a common envelope (CE) phase ensues, we estimate the final orbital separation based on the energy required to unbind the envelope. These calculations predict period gaps for planetary and brown dwarf companions to white dwarfs. The upper end of the gap is the shortest period at which a CE phase is avoided. The lower end is the longest period at which companions survive their CE phase. For binary systems with 1 $M_\odot$ progenitors, we predict no Jupiter-mass companions with periods $\lesssim$270 days. Once engulfed, Jupiter-mass companions do not survive a CE phase. For binary systems consisting of a 1 $M_\odot$ progenitor with a companion 10 times the mass of Jupiter, we predict a period gap between $\sim$0.1 and $\sim$380 days. These results are consistent with both the detection of a $\sim$50 $M_{\rm J}$ brown dwarf in a $\sim$0.003 AU ($\sim$0.08 day) orbit around the white dwarf WD 0137-349 and the tentative detection of a $\sim$2 $M_{\rm J}$ planet in a $\gtrsim$2.7 AU ($\gtrsim$4 year) orbit around the white dwarf GD66. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.2229;The Dynamical Evolution of the Pleiades; Joseph M. Converse,  Steven W. Stahler;  We present the results of a numerical simulation of the history and future development of the Pleiades. This study builds on our previous one that established statistically the present-day structure of this system. Our simulation begins just after molecular cloud gas has been expelled by the embedded stars. We then follow, using an N body code, the stellar dynamical evolution of the cluster to the present and beyond. Our initial state is that which evolves, over the 125 Myr age of the cluster, to a configuration most closely matching the current one. We find that the original cluster, newly stripped of gas, already had a virial radius of 4 pc. This configuration was larger than most observed, embedded clusters. Over time, the cluster expanded further and the central surface density fell by about a factor of two. We attribute both effects to the liberation of energy from tightening binaries of short period. Indeed, the original binary fraction was close to unity. The ancient Pleiades also had significant mass segregation, which persists in the cluster today. In the future, the central density of the Pleiades will continue to fall. For the first few hundred Myr, the cluster as a whole will expand because of dynamical heating by binaries. The expansion process is aided by mass loss through stellar evolution, which weakens the system's gravitational binding. At later times, the Galactic tidal field begins to heavily deplete the cluster mass. It is believed that most open clusters are eventually destroyed by close passage of a giant molecular cloud. Barring that eventuality, the density falloff will continue for as long as 1 Gyr, by which time most of the cluster mass will have been tidally stripped away by the Galactic field. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Woodward,  David H. Porter,  Gabriel Rockefeller,  Chris L. Fryer,  Michael Bennett,  Raphael Hirschi;  Depending on mass and metallicity as well as evolutionary phase, stars occasionally experience convective-reactive nucleosynthesis episodes. We specifically investigate the situation when nucleosynthetically unprocessed, H-rich material is convectively mixed with a He-burning zone, for example in convectively unstable shell on top of electron-degenerate cores in AGB stars, young white dwarfs or X-ray bursting neutron stars. Such episodes are frequently encountered in stellar evolution models of stars of extremely low or zero metal content [...] We focus on the convective-reactive episode in the very-late thermal pulse star Sakurai's object (V4334 Sagittarii). Asplund etal. (1999) determined the abundances of 28 elements, many of which are highly non-solar, ranging from H, He and Li all the way to Ba and La, plus the C isotopic ratio. Our simulations show that the mixing evolution according to standard, one-dimensional stellar evolution models implies neutron densities in the He that are too low to obtain a significant neutron capture nucleosynthesis on the heavy elements. We have carried out 3D hydrodynamic He-shell flash convection [...] we assume that the ingestion process of H into the He-shell convection zone leads only after some delay time to a sufficient entropy barrier that splits the convection zone [...] we obtain significantly higher neutron densities (~few 10^15 1/cm^3) and reproduce the key observed abundance trends found in Sakurai's object. These include an overproduction of Rb, Sr and Y by about 2 orders of magnitude higher than the overproduction of Ba and La. Such a peculiar nucleosynthesis signature is impossible to obtain with the mixing predictions in our one-dimensional stellar evolution models. [...] We determine how our results depend on uncertainties of nuclear reaction rates, for example for the C13(\alpha, n)O16 reaction. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.2261;A Model of Magnetic Braking of Solar Rotation That Satisfies  Observational Constraints; Pavel A. Denissenkov (University of Victoria);  The model of magnetic braking of solar rotation considered by Charbonneau & MacGregor (1993) has been modified so that it is able to reproduce for the first time the rotational evolution of both the fastest and slowest rotators among solar-type stars in open clusters of different ages, without coming into conflict with other observational constraints, such as the time evolution of the atmospheric Li abundance in solar twins and the thinness of the solar tachocline. This new model assumes that rotation-driven turbulent diffusion, which is thought to amplify the viscosity and magnetic diffusivity in stellar radiative zones, is strongly anisotropic with the horizontal components of the transport coefficients strongly dominating over those in the vertical direction. Also taken into account is the poloidal field decay that helps to confine the width of the tachocline at the solar age. The model's properties are investigated by numerically solving the azimuthal components of the coupled momentum and magnetic induction equations in two dimensions using a finite element method ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

The target plage region was near the west limb of the solar disk. This location permitted us to study the dynamics of spicular jets without the overlapping effect of spicular structures along the line of sight. In this work, to increase the ease with which we can identify spicules on the disk, we applied the image processing method `MadMax' developed by Koutchmy et al. (1989). It enhances fine, slender structures (like jets), over a diffuse background. We identified 169 spicules over the target plage. This sample permits us to derive statistically reliable results regarding spicular dynamics. The properties of plage spicules can be summarized as follows: (1) In a plage area, we clearly identified spicular jet features. (2) They were shorter in length than the quiet region limb spicules, and followed ballistic motion under constant deceleration. (3) The majority (80%) of the plage spicules showed the cycle of rise and retreat, while 10% of them faded out without a complete retreat phase. (4) The deceleration of the spicule was proportional to the velocity of ejection (i.e. the initial velocity). ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.2303;Non-Equipartition of Energy, Masses of Nova Ejecta, and Type Ia  Supernovae; Michael M. Shara,  Ofer Yaron,  Dina Prialnik,  Attay Kovetz;"  The total masses ejected during classical nova eruptions are needed to answer two questions with broad astrophysical implications: Can accreting white dwarfs be pushed towards the Chandrasekhar mass limit to yield type Ia supernovae? Are Ultra-luminous red variables a new kind of astrophysical phenomenon, or merely extreme classical novae? We review the methods used to determine nova ejecta masses. Except for the unique case of BT Mon (nova 1939), all nova ejecta mass determinations depend on untested assumptions and multi-parameter modeling. The remarkably simple assumption of equipartition between kinetic and radiated energy (E_kin and E_rad, respectively) in nova ejecta has been invoked as a way around this conundrum for the ultra-luminous red variable in M31. The deduced mass is far larger than that produced by any classical nova model. Our nova eruption simulations show that radiation and kinetic energy in nova ejecta are very far from being in energy equipartition, with variations of four orders of magnitude in the ratio E_kin/E_rad being commonplace. The assumption of equipartition must not be used to deduce nova ejecta masses; any such ""determinations"" can be overestimates by a factor of up to 10,000. We data-mined our extensive series of nova simulations to search for correlations that could yield nova ejecta masses. Remarkably, the mass ejected during a nova eruption is dependent only on (and is directly proportional to) E_rad. If we measure the distance to an erupting nova and its bolometric light curve then E_rad and hence the mass ejected can be directly measured. ";Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.2338;Linear Sensitivity of Helioseismic Travel Times to Local Flows; A.C. Birch,  L. Gizon;  Time-distance helioseismology is a technique for measuring the time for waves to travel from one point on the solar surface to another. These wave travel times are affected by advection by subsurface flows. Inferences of plasma flows based on observed travel times depend critically on the ability to accurately model the effects of subsurface flows on time-distance measurements. We present a Born approximation based computation of the sensitivity of time distance travel times to weak, steady, inhomogeneous subsurface flows. Three sensitivity functions are obtained, one for each component of the 3D vector flow. We show that the depth sensitivity of travel times to horizontally uniform flows is given approximately by the kinetic energy density of the oscillation modes which contribute to the travel times. For flows with strong depth dependence, the Born approximation can give substantially different results than the ray approximation. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Thilemann,  J.W. Truran;  The astrophysical site of the r-process is still uncertain, and a full exploration of the systematics of this process in terms of its dependence on nuclear properties from stability to the neutron drip-line within realistic stellar environments has still to be undertaken. Sufficiently high neutron to seed ratios can only be obtained either in very neutron-rich low-entropy environments or moderately neutron-rich high-entropy environments, related to neutron star mergers (or jets of neutron star matter) and the high-entropy wind of core-collapse supernova explosions. As chemical evolution models seem to disfavor neutron star mergers, we focus here on high-entropy environments characterized by entropy $S$, electron abundance $Y_e$ and expansion velocity $V_{exp}$. We investigate the termination point of charged-particle reactions, and we define a maximum entropy $S_{final}$ for a given $V_{exp}$ and $Y_e$, beyond which the seed production of heavy elements fails due to the very small matter density. We then investigate whether an r-process subsequent to the charged-particle freeze-out can in principle be understood on the basis of the classical approach, which assumes a chemical equilibrium between neutron captures and photodisintegrations, possibly followed by a $\beta$-flow equilibrium. In particular, we illustrate how long such a chemical equilibrium approximation holds, how the freeze-out from such conditions affects the abundance pattern, and which role the late capture of neutrons originating from $\beta$-delayed neutron emission can play. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Indeed time-distance helioseismology has already been applied to make inferences about structures and flows under sunspots and active regions, to map long-lived convective flow patterns, and so on. Yet certainly there are still many inadequacies in the current approaches and, as the data get better and the questions we seek to address get more subtle, methods that were previously regarded as adequate are no longer acceptable. Here we give a short and partial description of outstanding problems in local helioseismology, using time-distance helioseismology as a guiding example. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.2359;Numerical and semi-analytic core mass distributions in supersonic  isothermal turbulence; Wolfram Schmidt,  Sebastian A. W. Kern,  Christoph Federrath,  Ralf S. Klessen;  We investigate the influence of the turbulence forcing on the mass distributions of gravitationally unstable cores by postprocessing data from simulations of non-selfgravitating isothermal supersonic turbulence with varying resolution. In one set of simulations solenoidal forcing is applied, while the second set uses purely compressive forcing to excite turbulent motions. From the resulting density field, we compute the mass distribution of gravitationally unstable cores by means of a clump-finding algorithm. Using the time-averaged probability density functions of the mass density, semi-analytic mass distributions are calculated from analytical theories. We apply stability criteria that are based on the Bonnor-Ebert mass resulting from the thermal pressure and from the sum of thermal and turbulent pressure. Although there are uncertainties in the application of the clump-finding algorithm, we find systematic differences in the mass distributions obtained from solenoidal and compressive forcing. Compressive forcing produces a shallower slope in the high-mass power-law regime compared to solenoidal forcing. The mass distributions also depend on the Jeans length resulting from the choice of the mass in the computational box, which is freely scalable for non-selfgravitating isothermal turbulence. Provided that all cores are numerically resolved and most cores are small compared to the length scale of the forcing, the normalised core mass distributions are found to be close to the semi-analytic models. Especially for the high-mass tails, the Hennebelle-Chabrier theory implies that the additional support due to turbulent pressure is important. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Looney;"  We use archived IRAC images from the Spitzer Space Telescope to show that many Class 0 protostars exhibit complex, irregular, and non-axisymmetric structure within their dusty envelopes. Our 8 $\mu$m extinction maps probe some of the densest regions in these protostellar envelopes. Many of the systems are observed to have highly irregular and non-axisymmetric morphologies on scales >= 1000 AU, with a quarter of the sample exhibiting filamentary or flattened dense structures. Complex envelope structure is observed in regions spatially distinct from outflow cavities, and the densest structures often show no systematic alignment perpendicular to the cavities. These results indicate that mass ejection is not responsible for much of the irregular morphologies we detect; rather, we suggest that the observed envelope complexity is mostly the result of collapse from protostellar cores with initially non-equilibrium structures. The striking non-axisymmetry in many envelopes could provide favorable conditions for the formation of binary systems. We also note that protostars in the sample appear to be formed preferentially near the edges of clouds or bends in filaments, suggesting formation by gravitational focusing.

This sunspot was chosen because it is axisymmetric, shows little evolution during 20-28 January 2002, and was observed continuously by the MDI/SOHO instrument. (...) Wave travel times and mode frequencies are affected by the sunspot. In most cases, wave packets that propagate through the sunspot have reduced travel times. At short travel distances, however, the sign of the travel-time shifts appears to depend sensitively on how the data are processed and, in particular, on filtering in frequency-wavenumber space. We carry out two linear inversions for wave speed: one using travel-times and phase-speed filters and the other one using mode frequencies from ring analysis. These two inversions give subsurface wave-speed profiles with opposite signs and different amplitudes. (...) From this study of AR9787, we conclude that we are currently unable to provide a unified description of the subsurface structure and dynamics of the sunspot. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

The binary is unresolved in the XMM detectors, however the X-ray emission is very likely from the M8.5 dwarf. We compare its flaring emission to those of similar very low mass stars and additionally present an XMM observation of the M8 dwarf VB 10. We detect quasi-quiescent X-ray emission from SCR 1845-6357 at soft X-ray energies in the 0.2-2.0 keV band, as well as a strong flare with a count rate increase of a factor of 30 and a duration of only 10 minutes. The quasi-quiescent X-ray luminosity of log L_x = 26.2 erg/s and the corresponding activity level of log L_x/L_bol = -3.8 point to a fairly active star. Coronal temperatures of up to 5 MK and frequent minor variability support this picture. During the flare, that is accompanied by a significant brightening in the near-UV, plasma temperatures of 25-30 MK are observed and an X-ray luminosity of L_x= 8 x 10^27 erg/s is reached.

Cycle 24 began its migration at a rate 40% slower than the previous two solar cycles, thus indicating the possibility of a peculiar cycle. However, the onset of the ""Rush to the Poles"" of polar crown prominences and their associated coronal emission, which has been a precursor to solar maximum in recent cycles (cf.

The asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase marks the end of the evolution for low- and intermediate-mass stars, which are fundamental contributors to the mass return to the interstellar medium and to the chemical evolution of galaxies. The detailed understanding of mass loss processes is hampered by the poor knowledge of the luminosities and distances of AGB stars. Aims. In a series of papers we are trying to establish criteria permitting a more quantitative determination of luminosities for the various types of AGB stars, using the infrared (IR) fluxes as a basis. An updated compilation of the mass loss rates is also required, as it is crucial in our studies of the evolutionary properties of these stars. In this paper we concentrate our analysis on the study of the mass loss rates for a sample of galactic S stars. Methods. We reanalyze the properties of the stellar winds for a sample of galactic MS, S, SC stars with reliable estimates of the distance on the basis of criteria previously determined. We then compare the resulting mass loss rates with those previously obtained for a sample of C-rich AGB stars. Results. Stellar winds in S stars are on average less efficient than those of C-rich AGB stars of the same luminosity. Near-to-mid infrared colors appear to be crucial in our analysis. They show a good correlation with mass loss rates in particular for the Mira stars. We suggest that the relations between the rates of the stellar winds and both the near-to-mid infrared colors and the periods of variability improve the understanding of the late evolutionary stages of low mass stars and could be the origin of the relation between the rates of the stellar winds and the bolometric magnitudes. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Turner,  Hubert Klahr,  Thomas Henning;  The poorly-ionized interior of the protoplanetary disk is the location where dust coagulation processes may be most efficient. However even here, planetesimal formation may be limited by the loss of solid material through radial drift, and by collisional fragmentation of the particles. Our aim is to investigate the possibility that solid particles are trapped at local pressure maxima in the dynamically evolving disk. We perform the first 3-D global non-ideal MHD calculations of the disk treating the turbulence driven by the magneto-rotational instability. The domain contains an inner MRI-active region near the young star and an outer midplane dead zone, with the transition between the two modeled by a sharp increase in the magnetic diffusivity. The azimuthal magnetic fields generated in the active zone oscillate over time, changing sign about every 150 years. We thus observe the radial structure of the `butterfly pattern' seen previously in local shearing-box simulations. The mean magnetic field diffuses from the active zone into the dead zone, where the Reynolds stress nevertheless dominates. The greater total accretion stress in the active zone leads to a net reduction in the surface density, so that after 800 years an approximate steady state is reached in which a local radial maximum in the midplane pressure lies near the transition radius. We also observe the formation of density ridges within the active zone. The dead zone in our models possesses a mean magnetic field, significant Reynolds stresses and a steady local pressure maximum at the inner edge, where the outward migration of planetary embryos and the efficient trapping of solid material are possible. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)"

We study this effect within a relativistic Thomas-Fermi approximation and demonstrate that the strength of the electric field depends strongly on the degree of sharpness of the surface.

For some elements, however, the abundance difference could be real. We address the issue by observing 2 solar--type dwarfs in NGC 5822 and 3 in IC 4756, and comparing their composition with that of 3 giants in either of the aforementioned clusters. We determine iron abundance and stellar parameters of the dwarf stars, and the abundances of calcium, sodium, nickel, titanium, aluminium, chromium, silicon and oxygen for both the giants and dwarfs. We acquired UVES high-resolution, of high signal--to--noise ratio (S/N) spectra. The width of the cross correlation profiles was used to measure rotation velocities. For abundance determinations, the standard equivalent width analysis was performed differentially with respect to the Sun. For lithium and oxygen, we derived abundances by comparing synthetic spectra with observed line features. We find an iron abundance for dwarf stars equal to solar to within the margins of error for IC 4756, and slightly above for NGC 5822 ([Fe/H]= 0.01 and 0.05 dex respectively). The 3 stars in NG 4756 have lithium abundances between Log N(Li) 2.6 and 2.8 dex, the two stars in NGC 5822 have Log N(Li) ~ 2.8 and 2.5, respectively.

We measure equivalent widths of atomic CI lines on high resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio solar atlases. Deviations from local thermodynamic equilibrium are computed in 1D with the Kiel code. Our recommended value for the solar carbon abundance, relies on 98 independent measurements of observed lines and is A(C)=8.50+-0.06, the quoted error is the sum of statistical and systematic error. Combined with our recent results for the solar oxygen and nitrogen abundances this implies a solar metallicity of Z=0.0154 and Z/X=0.0211. Our analysis implies a solar carbon abundance which is about 0.1 dex higher than what was found in previous analysis based on different 3D hydrodynamical computations. The difference is partly driven by our equivalent width measurements (we measure, on average, larger equivalent widths with respect to the other work based on a 3D model), in part it is likely due to the different properties of the hydrodynamical simulations and the spectrum synthesis code. The solar metallicity we obtain from the CO5BOLD analyses is in slightly better agreement with the constraints of helioseismology than the previous 3D abundance results.

Einaudi;  The Parker or field line tangling model of coronal heating is investigated through long-time high-resolution simulations of the dynamics of a coronal loop in cartesian geometry within the framework of reduced magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD). Slow photospheric motions induce a Poynting flux which saturates by driving an anisotropic turbulent cascade dominated by magnetic energy and characterized by current sheets elongated along the axial magnetic field. Increasing the value of the axial magnetic field different regimes of MHD turbulence develop with a bearing on coronal heating rates. In physical space magnetic field lines at the scale of convection cells appear only slightly bended in agreement with observations of large loops of current (E)UV and X-ray imagers. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.2635;Heating of coronal loops: weak MHD turbulence and scaling laws; A.F. Rappazzo,  M. Velli,  G. Einaudi;  To understand the nonlinear dynamics of the Parker scenario for coronal heating, long-time high-resolution simulations of the dynamics of a coronal loop in cartesian geometry are carried out. A loop is modeled as a box extended along the direction of the strong magnetic field $B_0$ in which the system is embedded. At the top and bottom plates, which represent the photosphere, velocity fields mimicking photospheric motions are imposed. We show that the nonlinear dynamics is described by different regimes of MHD anisotropic turbulence, with spectra characterized by intertial range power laws whose indexes range from Kolmogorov-like values ($\sim 5/3$) up to $\sim 3$. We briefly describe the bearing for coronal heating rates. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Greiner;"  Benchmark brown dwarfs are those objects for which fiducial constraints are available, including effective temperature, parallax, age, metallicity. We searched for new cool brown dwarfs in 186 sq.deg. of the new area covered by the data release DR5+ of the UKIDSS Large Area Survey. Follow-up optical and near-infrared broad-band photometry, and methane imaging of four promising candidates, revealed three objects with distinct methane absorption, typical of mid- to late-T dwarfs, and one possibly T4 dwarf. The latest-type object, classified as T8-9, shares its large proper motion with Ross 458 (BD+13o2618), an active M0.5 binary which is 102"" away, forming a hierarchical low-mass star+brown dwarf system. Ross 458C has an absolute J-band magnitude of 16.4, and seems overluminous, particularly in the K band, compared to similar field brown dwarfs. We estimate the age of the system to be less than 1 Gyr, and its mass to be as low as 14 Jupiter masses for the age of 1 Gyr. At 11.4 pc, this new late T benchmark dwarf is a promising target to constrain the evolutionary and atmospheric models of very low-mass brown dwarfs. We present proper motion measurements for our targets and for 13 known brown dwarfs. Two brown dwarfs have velocities typical of the thick disk and may be old brown dwarfs.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.2673;Derivation of Stochastic Acceleration Model Characteristics for Solar  Flares From RHESSI Hard X-Ray Observations; Vahe Petrosian,  Qingrong Chen;  The model of stochastic acceleration of particles by turbulence has been successful in explaining many observed features of solar flares. Here we demonstrate a new method to obtain the accelerated electron spectrum and important acceleration model parameters from the high resolution hard X-ray observations provided by the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI). In our model, electrons accelerated at or very near the loop top produce thin target bremsstrahlung emission there and then escape downward producing thick target emission at the loop footpoints. Based on the electron flux spectral images obtained by the regularized inversion of the RHESSI count visibilities, we derive several important parameters for the acceleration model. We apply this procedure to the 2003 November 03 solar flare, which shows a loop top source up to 100--150 keV in hard X-ray with a relatively flat spectrum in addition to two footpoint sources. The results imply presence of strong scattering and a high density of turbulence energy with a steep spectrum in the acceleration region. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Zhou;  We present an up-to-date catalog of pulsating binaries, i.e. the binary and multiple stellar systems containing pulsating components, along with a statistics on them. Compared to the earlier compilation by Soydugan et al.(2006a) of 25 delta Scuti-type `oscillating Algol-type eclipsing binaries' (oEA), the recent collection of 74 oEA by Liakos et al.(2012), and the collection of Cepheids in binaries by Szabados (2003a), the numbers and types of pulsating variables in binaries are now extended. The total numbers of pulsating binary/multiple stellar systems have increased to be 515 as of 2014 October 26, among which 262+ are oscillating eclipsing binaries and the oEA containing delta Scuti components are updated to be 96. The catalog is intended to be a collection of various pulsating binary stars across the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. We reviewed the open questions, advances and prospects connecting pulsation/oscillation and binarity. The observational implication of binary systems with pulsating components, to stellar evolution theories is also addressed. In addition, we have searched the Simbad database for candidate pulsating binaries. As a result, 322 candidates were extracted. Furthermore, a brief statistics on Algol-type eclipsing binaries (EA) based on the existing catalogs is given. We got 5315 EA, of which there are 904 EA with spectral types A and F.

By presenting a derivation of the energy balance equation and transfer functions for compressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), we quantify the source of magnetic energy on a scale-by-scale basis. We rule out the two alternative mechanisms for the generation of small-scale magnetic field in the simulations: the tangling of magnetic field lines associated with the turbulent cascade and Alfvenization of small-scale velocity fluctuations (""turbulent induction""). Instead, we find the dominant source of small-scale magnetic energy is stretching by inertial-range fluid motions of small-scale magnetic field lines against the magnetic tension force to produce (against Ohmic dissipation) more small-scale magnetic field. The scales involved become smaller with increasing Reynolds number, which identifies the dynamo as a small-scale turbulent dynamo.

Increasing or decreasing the rate by a factor of 10 affects the convective history and nucleosynthesis, and consequently the final yields. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.2934;Heliospheric Magnetic Field 1835-2009; Leif Svalgaard,  Edward W. Cliver;"  We use recently acquired geomagnetic archival data to extend our long-term reconstruction of the HMF strength. The 1835-2009 HMF series is based on an updated and substantiated IDV series from 1872-onwards and on Bartels' extension, by proxy, of his u-series from 1835-1871. The new IDV series, termed IDV09, has excellent agreement (R^2 = 0.98; RMS = 0.3 nT) with the earlier IDV05 series, and also with the negative component of Love's extended (to 1905) Dst series (R^2 = 0.91). Of greatest importance to the community, in an area of research that has been contentious, comparison of the extended HMF series with other recent reconstructions of solar wind B for the last ~100 years yields a strong consensus between series based on geomagnetic data. Differences exist from ~1900-1910 but they are far smaller than the previous disagreement for this key interval of low solar wind B values which closely resembles current solar activity. Equally encouraging, a discrepancy with an HMF reconstruction based on 10Be data for the first half of the 20th century has largely been removed by a revised 10Be-based reconstruction published after we submitted this paper, although a remaining discrepancy for the years ~1885-1905 will need to be resolved.

González;  HD 65949 is a late B star with exceptionally strong Hg II at 3984[A], but it is not a typical HgMn star. The Re II spectrum is of extraordinary strength. Abundances, or upper limits are derived here for 58 elements based on a model with Teff = 13100K, and log(g) = 4.0. Even-Z elements through nickel show minor deviations from solar abundances. Anomalies among the odd-Z elements through copper are mostly small. Beyond the iron peak, a huge scatter is found. The abundance pattern of the heaviest elements resembles the N=126 r-process peak of solar material, though not in detail. We find a significant correlation of the abundance excesses with second ionization potentials for elements with Z > 30. This indicates the relevance of photospheric or near-photospheric processes. We explore a model with mass accretion of exotic material followed by the more commonly accepted differentiation by diffusion. That model leads to a number of predictions which challenge future work. Likely primary and secondary masses are near 3.3 and 1.6 M(solar), with a separation of ca. 0.25 AU.

Wolf (3) ((1) Instituto de Astrofisica de Andalucia, Spain; (2) Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, USA; (3) Astronomical Institute, Charles University Prague, Czech Republic)";  For the past three decades, and until recently, there has been a serious discrepancy between the observed and theoretical values of the apsidal motion rate dw/dt of the eccentric eclipsing binary DI Her, which has even been interpreted occasionally as a possible failure of General Relativity (GR). Recent observations of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect have shown convincingly that the reason for the anomaly is that the rotational axes of the stars and the orbital axis are misaligned, which changes the predicted rate of precession significantly. Although as a result of those measurements the disagreement is now drastically smaller, it remains formally at the level of 50%, possibly due to errors in the measured apsidal motion rate, outdated stellar models, or inaccuracies in the stellar parameters. Here we address each of these issues in order to improve the agreement further. New times of minimum have been collected in order to redetermine the apsidal motion rate. We have computed new stellar evolution models with updated physical inputs, and derived improved apsidal motion constants for the components. We have performed Monte Carlo simulations to infer the theoretical distribution of dw/dt, including the contributions from GR as well as tidal and rotational distortions. All observational errors have been accounted for. Our simulations yield a retrograde apsidal motion rate due to the rotationally-induced oblateness of -0.00056 deg/cycle (mode of the distribution), a GR contribution of +0.00068 deg/cycle, and a tidal contribution of +0.00034 deg/cycle, leading to a total predicted rate of +0.00046 deg/cycle. This is in excellent agreement with the newly measured value of +0.00042 deg/cycle. The formal difference is now reduced to 10%, a small fraction of the observational uncertainties.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.0017;Global Self-Similar Protostellar Disk/Wind Models; Seth Teitler;"  The magnetocentrifugal disk wind mechanism is the leading candidate for producing the large-scale, bipolar jets commonly seen in protostellar systems. I present a detailed formulation of a global, radially self-similar model for a non-ideal disk that launches a magnetocentrifugal wind. This formulation generalizes the conductivity tensor formalism previously used in radially localized disk models. The model involves matching a solution of the equations of non-ideal MHD describing matter in the disk to a solution of the equations of ideal MHD describing a ""cold"" wind. The disk solution must pass smoothly through the sonic point, the wind solution must pass smoothly through the Alfv\'en point, and the two solutions must match at the disk/wind interface. This model includes for the first time a self-consistent treatment of the evolution of magnetic flux threading the disk, which can change on the disk accretion timescale. The formulation presented here also allows a realistic conductivity profile for the disk to be used in a global disk/wind model for the first time. The physical constraints on the model solutions fix the distribution of the magnetic field threading the disk, the midplane accretion speed, and the midplane migration speed of flux surfaces. I present a representative solution that corresponds to a disk in the ambipolar conductivity regime with a nominal neutral-matter--magnetic-field coupling parameter that is constant along field lines, matched to a wind solution. I conclude with a brief discussion of the importance of self-similar disk/wind models in studying global processes such as dust evolution in protostellar systems.

We present a study of the formation of CO2 via the non-energetic route CO + OH on non-porous H2O and amorphous silicate surfaces. Our results are in the form of temperature-programmed desorption spectra of CO2 produced via two experimental routes: O2 + CO + H and O3 + CO + H. The maximum yield of CO2 is around 8 % with respect to the starting quantity of CO, suggesting a barrier to CO + OH. The rate of reaction, based on modelling results, is 24 times slower than O2 + H. Our model suggests that competition between CO2 formation via CO + OH and other surface reactions of OH is a key factor in the low yields of CO2 obtained experimentally, with relative reaction rates k(CO+H) \ll k(CO+OH) < k(H2O2+H) < k(OH+H), k(O2+H). Astrophysically, the presence of CO2 in low AV regions of molecular clouds could be explained by the reaction CO + OH occurring concurrently with the formation of H2O via the route OH + H. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

From an analysis of the eclipse times of minimum during the outburst, we determined the orbital period as Porb = 0.2096(4) d or 5.030(10) h. The orbital period places it above the period gap in the distribution of orbital periods of dwarf novae. The eclipses are of short duration (average FWHM = 10.7 min or 0.036 of the orbital period) and shallow (average 0.4 mag during outburst and 0.6 magnitude in quiescence), suggesting a grazing eclipse. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

The large-scale features of solar wind speed and density turbulence of the current minimum are remarkably different from that of the previous cycle.

At a given distance from the Sun, the density turbulence is maximum around the maximum phase of the solar cycle and it reduces to ~70%, near the minimum phase. However, in the current minimum of solar activity, the level of turbulence has gradually decreased, starting from the year 2005, to the present level of ~30%.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.0173;Shear modulus of neutron star crust; D. A. Baiko;  Shear modulus of solid neutron star crust is calculated by thermodynamic perturbation theory taking into account ion motion. At given density the crust is modelled as a body-centered cubic Coulomb crystal of fully ionized atomic nuclei of one type with the uniform charge-compensating electron background. Classic and quantum regimes of ion motion are considered. The calculations in the classic temperature range agree well with previous Monte Carlo simulations. At these temperatures the shear modulus is given by the sum of a positive contribution due to the static lattice and a negative $\propto T$ contribution due to the ion motion. The quantum calculations are performed for the first time. The main result is that at low temperatures the contribution to the shear modulus due to the ion motion saturates at a constant value, associated with zero-point ion vibrations. Such behavior is qualitatively similar to the zero-point ion motion contribution to the crystal energy. The quantum effects may be important for lighter elements at higher densities, where the ion plasma temperature is not entirely negligible compared to the typical Coulomb ion interaction energy. The results of numerical calculations are approximated by convenient fitting formulae. They should be used for precise neutron star oscillation modelling, a rapidly developing branch of stellar seismology. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)"

We develop a method for mass C/O classification of AGBs in photometric surveys without using periods. For this purpose we rely on the slopes in the tracks of individual stars in the colour-magnitude diagram. We demonstrate that our method enables the separation of C-rich and O-rich AGB stars with little confusion. For the Magellanic Clouds we demonstrate that this method works for several photometric surveys and filter combinations. As we rely on no period identification, our results are relatively insensitive to the phase coverage, aliasing, and time-sampling problems that plague period analyses. For a subsample of our stars, we verify our C/O classification against published C/O catalogues. With our method we are able to produce C/O maps of the entire Magellanic Clouds. Our purely photometric method for classification of C- and O-rich AGBs constitutes a method of choice for large, near-infrared photometric surveys. Because our method depends on the slope of colour-magnitude variation but not on magnitude zero point, it remains applicable to objects with unknown distances. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

We use Spitzer IRS spectra taken in both the high and low resolution modules for the same sources to investigate whether it is possible to define line indices that can measure trends in the strength of the molecular features in low resolution data. We find that trends in HCN emission strength seen in the high resolution data can be recovered in low resolution data. In examining the factors that influence the HCN emission strength, we find that the low resolution HCN flux is modestly correlated with stellar accretion rate and X-ray luminosity. Correlations of this kind are perhaps expected based on recent observational and theoretical studies of inner disk atmospheres. Our results demonstrate the potential of using the large number of low resolution disk spectra that reside in the Spitzer archive to study the factors that influence the strength of molecular emission from disks. Such studies would complement results for the much smaller number of circumstellar disks that have been observed at high resolution with IRS. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

The only theoretical models which have addressed this puzzle are surface transport models and flux-transport dynamo models. Comparing polar fields obtained from numerical simulations using surface flux transport models and flux-transport dynamo models, we show that both classes of models can explain the polar field features within the scope of the physics included in the respective models. In both models, how polar fields change as a result of changes in meridional circulation depends on the details of meridional circulation profile used. Using physical reasoning and schematics as well as numerical solutions from a flux-transport dynamo model, we demonstrate that polar fields are determined mostly by the strength of surface poloidal source provided by the decay of tilted, bipolar active regions. Profile of meridional flow with latitude and its changes with time have much less effect in flux-transport dynamo models than in surface transport models. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.0342;The spectroscopic orbit of Capella revisited; Michael Weber,  Klaus G. Strassmeier;  Context. Capella is among the few binary stars with two evolved giant components. The hotter component is a chromospherically active star within the Hertzsprung gap, while the cooler star is possibly helium-core burning. Aims. The known inclination of the orbital plane from astrometry in combination with precise radial velocities will allow very accurate masses to be determined for the individual Capella stars. This will constrain their evolutionary stage and possibly the role of the active star's magnetic field on the dynamical evolution of the binary system. Methods. We obtained a total of 438 high-resolution \'echelle spectra during the years 2007-2010 and used the measured velocities to recompute the orbital elements. Our double-lined orbital solution yields average residuals of 64 m/s for the cool component and 297 m/s for the more rapidly rotating hotter component. Results. The semi-amplitude of the cool component is smaller by 0.045 km/s than the orbit determination of Torres et al. from data taken during 1996-1999 but more precise by a factor of 5.5, while for the hotter component it is larger by 0.580 km/s and more precise by a factor of 3.6. This corresponds to masses of 2.573\pm0.009 M_sun and 2.488\pm0.008 M_sun for the cool and hot component, respectively. Their relative errors of 0.34% and 0.30% are about half of the values given in Torres et al. for a combined literature- data solution but with absolute values different by 4% and 2% for the two components, respectively. The mass ratio of the system is therefore q = M_A/M_B = 0.9673 \pm 0.0020. Conclusions.

The corrected Sr abundances and previously obtained NLTE Ba abundances are compared to the predictions of several hypothetical formation processes for the lighter neutron-capture elements. Our NLTE abundances confirm the previously determined huge scatter of the strontium abundance in low metallicity stars. This scatter is also found (and is even larger) at very low metallicities (i. e. early in the chemical evolution).

Additional support to this hypothesis has been recently provided by the detection of circumstellar material around SN2006X and SN2007le, showing a structure compatible with that expected for recurrent nova outbursts.In this paper we investigate the circumstellar environment of RS Oph and its structure, with the aim of establishing a firmer and independent link between this class of objects and Type Ia SN progenitors. Methods: We study the time evolution of CaII, NaI and KI absorption features in RS Oph, before, during, and after the last outburst, using multi-epoch, high-resolution spectroscopy, and applying the same method adopted for SN2006X and SN2007le. Results: A number of components, blue-shifted with respect to the systemic velocity of RS Oph, are detected. In particular, one feature strongly weakens in the first two weeks after the outburst, simultaneously with the disappearance of very narrow P-Cyg profiles overimposed on the much wider nova emission lines of H, He, FeII and other elements. Conclusions: We interpret these facts as the signature of density enhancements in the circumstellar material, suggesting that the recurrent eruptions might indeed create complex structures within the material lost by the donor star. This establishes a strong link between RS Oph and the progenitor system of the Type Ia SN2006X, for which similar features have been detected. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Rebolo,  A. Ecuvillon;"  Context: Chemical abundances of light elements as beryllium in planet-host stars allow us to study the planet formation scenarios and/or investigate possible surface pollution processes. Aims: We present here an extension of previous beryllium abundance studies. The complete sample consists of 70 stars hosting planets and 30 stars without known planetary companions. The aim of this paper is to further assess the trends found in previous studies with less number of objects. This will provide more information on the processes of depletion and mixing of light elements in the interior of late type stars, and will provide possible explanations for the abundance differences between stars that host planets and ""single"" stars. Methods: Using high resolution UVES spectra, we measure beryllium abundances of 26 stars that host planets and 1 ""single"" star mainly using the lambda 3131.065 A Be II line, by fitting synthetic spectra to the observational data. We also compile beryllium abundance measurements of 44 stars hosting planets and 29 ""single"" stars from the literature, resulting in a final sample of 100 objects. Results: We confirm that the beryllium content is roughly the same in stars hosting planets and in ""single"" stars at temperatures Teff > 5700K. The sample is still small for Teff < 5500K, but it seems that the scatter in Be abundances of dwarf stars is slightly higher at these cooler temperatures. Conclusions: We search for distinctive characteristics of planet hosts through correlations of Be abundance versus Li abundance, age, metallicity and oxygen abundance. These could provide some insight in the formation and evolution of planetary systems, but we did not find any clear correlation. ";Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Soubiran;  We present the results of determination of the barium abundance considering the non-LTE (NLTE) effects in 172 dwarf stars in the metallicity range of -1< [Fe/H] <+0.3, assigned to different Galactic substructures by kinematic criteria. We used a model of the Ba atom with 31 levels of Ba I and 101 levels of Ba II. The atmosphere models for the investigated stars were computed using the ATLAS9 code modified by new opacity distribution functions. The NLTE profiles of the unblended Ba II (4554 A, 5853 A, 6496 A) were computed and then compared to those observed. The line 6141 A was also used, but with an allowance for its correlation with the iron line. The average barium abundances in the thin and thick discs are 0.01 +/- 0.08 and -0.03 +/- 0.07, respectively. The comparison to the calculations of the Galactic chemical evolution by Serminato et al. (2009) was conducted. The trend obtained for the Ba abundance versus [Fe/H] suggests a complex barium production process in the thin and thick discs. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Green,  Young-Beom Jeon;  We report the results of our high resolution optical spectroscopic monitoring campaign ($\lambda$ = 3800 -- 8800 A, R = 30000 -- 45000) of the new FU Orionis-type object HBC 722. We observed HBC 722 with the BOES 1.8-m telescope between 2010 November 26 and 2010 December 29 and FU Orionis itself on 2011 January 26. We detect a number of previously unreported high-resolution K I and Ca II lines beyond 7500 A. We resolve the H$\alpha$ and Ca II line profiles into three velocity components, which we attribute to both disk and outflow. The increased accretion during outburst can heat the disk to produce the relatively narrow absorption feature and launch outflows appearing as high velocity blue and redshifted broad features. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Mosser;  Asteroseismology of stars that exhibit solar-like oscillations are enjoying a growing interest with the wealth of observational results obtained with the CoRoT and Kepler missions. In this framework, scaling laws between asteroseismic quantities and stellar parameters are becoming essential tools to study a rich variety of stars. However, the physical underlying mechanisms of those scaling laws are still poorly known. Our objective is to provide a theoretical basis for the scaling between the frequency of the maximum in the power spectrum ($\nu_{\rm max}$) of solar-like oscillations and the cut-off frequency ($\nu_{\rm c}$). Using the SoHO GOLF observations together with theoretical considerations, we first confirm that the maximum of the height in oscillation power spectrum is determined by the so-called \emph{plateau} of the damping rates. The physical origin of the plateau can be traced to the destabilizing effect of the Lagrangian perturbation of entropy in the upper-most layers which becomes important when the modal period and the local thermal relaxation time-scale are comparable. Based on this analysis, we then find a linear relation between $\nu_{\rm max}$ and $\nu_{\rm c}$, with a coefficient that depends on the ratio of the Mach number of the exciting turbulence to the third power to the mixing-length parameter. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.0664;Dynamo-driven plasmoid ejections above a spherical surface; Jörn Warnecke,  Axel Brandenburg,  Dhrubaditya Mitra;  We extend earlier models of turbulent dynamos with an upper, nearly force-free exterior to spherical geometry, and study how flux emerges from lower layers to the upper ones without being driven by magnetic buoyancy. We also study how this affects the possibility of plasmoid ejection. A spherical wedge is used that includes northern and southern hemispheres up to mid-latitudes and a certain range in longitude of the Sun. In radius, we cover both the region that corresponds to the convection zone in the Sun and the immediate exterior up to twice the radius of the Sun. Turbulence is driven with a helical forcing function in the interior, where the sign changes at the equator between the two hemispheres. An oscillatory large-scale dynamo with equatorward migration is found to operate in the turbulence zone. Plasmoid ejections occur in regular intervals, similar to what is seen in earlier Cartesian models. These plasmoid ejections are tentatively associated with coronal mass ejections. The magnetic helicity is found to change sign outside the turbulence zone, which is in agreement with recent findings for the solar wind. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Nysewander;  Dominated by a single, large-amplitude pulsation mode, the rapidly-pulsating hot subdwarf B star CS 1246 is a prime candidate for a long-term O-C diagram study. We collected nearly 400 hours of photometry with the PROMPT telescopes over a time span of 14 months to begin looking for secular variations in the pulse timings. Interestingly, the O-C diagram is dominated by a strong sinusoidal pattern with a period of 14.1 days and an amplitude of 10.7 light-seconds. Underneath this sine wave is a secular trend implying a decrease in the 371.7-s pulsational period of Pdot = -1.9 x 10^-11, which we attribute to the evolution of the star through the H-R diagram. The sinusoidal variation could be produced by the presence of a low-mass companion, with m sin i ~ 0.12 Msun, orbiting the subdwarf B star at a distance of 20 Rsun. An analysis of the combined light curve reveals the presence of a low-amplitude first harmonic to the main pulsation mode. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Kirillov,  Frank Stefani;  The magnetorotational instability (MRI) triggers turbulence and enables outward transport of angular momentum in hydrodynamically stable accretion discs. By using the WKB approximation and methods of singular function theory, we resolve two different paradoxes of MRI that appear in the limits of infinite and vanishing magnetic Prandtl number. For the latter case we derive a new strict limit of the critical Rossby number. This new limit of ${\rm Ro_c}=-0.802$, which appears for a finite Lundquist number of ${\rm Lu}=0.618$, extends the formerly known inductionless Liu limit of ${\rm Ro_c}=-0.828$ valid at ${\rm Lu}=0$. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.0741;Notes on the stability threshold for radially anisotropic polytrope; E. V. Polyachenko,  V. L. Polyachenko,  I. G. Shukhman;  We discuss some contradictions found in the literature concerning the problem of stability of collisionless spherical stellar systems which are the simplest anisotropic generalization of the well-known polytrope models. Their distribution function $F(E,L)$ is a product of power-low functions of the energy $E$ and the angular momentum $L$, i.e. $F\propto L^{-s}(-E)^q$. On the one hand, calculation of the growth rates in the framework of linear stability theory and N-body simulations show that these systems become stable when the parameter $s$ characterizing the velocity anisotropy of the stellar distribution is lower than some finite threshold value, $s<s_\textrm{crit}$. On the other hand Palmer & Papaloizou (1987) showed that the instability remained up to the isotropic limit $s=0$. Using our method of determining the eigenmodes for stellar systems, we show that the growth rates in weakly radially-anisotropic systems are indeed positive, but decrease exponentially as the parameter $s$ approaches zero, i.e. $\gamma\propto \exp(-s_{\ast}/s)$. In fact, for the systems with finite lifetime this means stability. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO)"

Significant increase in the average energy of SNe Ia due to increase in the total mass of merging dwarfs can be observed at red shift z> 2. The observed dependence of the distance modulus from the red shift in observations of SNe Ia can be explained not only by the assumption about accelerated expansion of the Universe, but also by the evolution of the absorbtion of light by grey dust in various types of host galaxies of SNe Ia, by the effects of observational selection and by the decrease in the average mass of coalescing degenerate dwarfs. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.0832;Thermohaline mixing and the photospheric composition of low-mass giant  stars; F. C. Wachlin,  M. M. Miller Bertolami,  L. G. Althaus;  We compute full evolutionary sequences of red giant branch stars close to the luminosity bump by including state of the art composition transport prescriptions for the thermohaline mixing regimes. In particular we adopt a self-consistent double-diffusive convection theory, that allows to handle the instabilities that arise when thermal and composition gradients compete against each other, and a very recent empirically motivated and parameter free asymptotic scaling law for thermohaline composition transport. In agreement with previous works, we find that during the red giant stage, a thermohaline instability sets in shortly after the hydrogen burning shell (HBS) encounters the chemical discontinuity left behind by the first dredge-up. We also find that the thermohaline unstable region, initially appearing at the exterior wing of the HBS, is unable to reach the outer convective envelope, with the consequence that no mixing of elements that produces a non-canonical modification of the stellar surface abundances occurs. Also in agreement with previous works, we find that by artificially increasing the mixing efficiency of thermohaline regions it is possible to connect both unstable regions, thus affecting the photospheric composition. However, we find that in order to reproduce the observed abundances of red giant branch stars close to the luminosity bump, thermohaline mixing efficiency has to be artificially increased by about 4 orders of magnitude from that predicted by recent 3D numerical simulations of thermohaline convection close to astrophysical environments. From this we conclude the chemical abundance anomalies of red giant stars cannot be explained on the basis of thermohaline mixing alone. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

In many such cases impulsive phase is weak with lack of typical short-lasting pulses. Instead of that smooth, long-lasting Hard X-ray (HXR) emission is observed. We analysed hard X-ray emission and morphology of six selected SLDEs. In our analysis we utilized data from RHESSI and GOES satellites. Physical parameters of HXR sources were obtained from imaging spectroscopy and were used for the energy balance analysis. Characteristic time of heating rate decrease, after reaching its maximum value, is very long, which explains long rising phase of these flares. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.0845;Determination of electron density and filling factor for soft X-ray  flare kernels; Jerzy Jakimiec,  Urszula Bak-Steslicka;  In a standard method of determining electron density for soft X-ray (SXR) flare kernels it is necessary to assume what is the extension of a kernel along the line of sight. This is a source of significant uncertainty of the obtained densities. In our previous paper (Bak-Steslicka and Jakimiec, 2005) we have worked out another method of deriving electron density, in which it is not necessary to assume what is the extension of a kernel along the line of sight. The point is that many flares, during their decay phase, evolve along the sequence of steady-state models [quasi-steady-state (QSS) evolution] and then the scaling law, derived for steady-state models, can be used to determine the electron density. The aim of the present paper is: (1) to improve the two methods of density determination, (2) to compare the densities obtained with the two methods. We have selected a number of flares which showed QSS evolution during the decay phase. For these flares the electron density, N, has been derived by means of standard method and with our QSS method. Comparison of the N values obtained with the two different methods allowed us: (1) to test the obtained densities, (2) to evaluate the volume filling factor of the SXR emitting plasma. Generally, we have found good agreement (no large systematic difference) between the values of electron density obtained with the two methods, but for some cases the values can differ by a factor up to 2. For most flare kernels estimated filling factor turned out to be about 1, near the flare maximum. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

The duration of the acceleration phase is related to the duration of the rise phase of a flare. We investigated CMEs associated with long duration flares of slow rise phase (slow LDE). These CMEs are characterized by high velocity (v>1000 km/s) during the propagation phase and low average acceleration during the main, prolongated, acceleration phase. The CMEs are accelerated until the height $> 5 R_\odot$, which is higher value than in typical impulsive CMEs. CMEs associated with slow LDEs have characteristics of both classes of CMEs, i.e. CMEs associated with flares and CMEs associated with eruptive prominences. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

For some time intervals clear non-thermal component was observed in spectra, but there was no significant footpoint emission at that time. All thermal and non-thermal emissions originate from the LTS.

However, given the complexity of massive star forming regions, such studies are still limited in number. Additionally, there is still no general consensus on the molecular tracers to be used for such investigations. Because of its close distance and high luminosity, IRAS 17233-3606 is a potential good laboratory to search for traces of rotation in the inner gas around the protostar(s). Therefore, we selected the source for a detailed analysis of its molecular emission at 230 GHz with the SMA. We systematically investigated the velocity fields of transitions in the SMA spectra which are not affected by overlap with other transitions, and searched for coherent velocity gradients to compare them to the distribution of outflows in the region. Beside CO emission we also used high-angular H2 images to trace the outflow motions driven by the IRAS 17233-3606 cluster. We find linear velocity gradients in many transitions of the same molecular species and in several molecules. We report the first detection of HNCO in molecular outflows from massive YSOs. We discuss the CH3CN velocity gradient taking into account various scenarios: rotation, presence of multiple unresolved sources with different velocities, and outflow(s). Although other interpretations cannot be ruled out, we propose that the CH3CN emission might be affected by the outflows of the region. Higher angular observations are needed to discriminate between the different scenarios. The present observations, with the possible association of CH3CN with outflows in a few thousands AU around the YSOs' cluster, (i) question the choice of the tracer to probe rotating structures, and (ii) show the importance of the use of H2 images for detailed studies of kinematics. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.0864;On Orbital Period Changes in Nova Outbursts; Rebecca G. Martin,  Mario Livio,  Bradley E. Schaefer;  We propose a new mechanism that produces an orbital period change during a nova outburst. When the ejected material carries away the specific angular momentum of the white dwarf, the orbital period increases. A magnetic field on the surface of the secondary star forces a fraction of the ejected material to corotate with the star, and hence the binary system. The ejected material thus takes angular momentum from the binary orbit and the orbital period decreases. We show that for sufficiently strong magnetic fields on the surface of the secondary star, the total change to the orbital period could even be negative during a nova outburst, contrary to previous expectations. Accurate determinations of pre- and post-outburst orbital periods of recurrent nova systems could test the new mechanism, in addition to providing meaningful constraints on otherwise difficult to measure physical quantities. We apply our mechanism to outbursts of the recurrent nova U Sco. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Krivova,  Sami Solanki,  Jerald W. Harder;  Aims: We investigate how well modeled solar irradiances agree with measurements from the SORCE satellite, both for total solar irradiance and broken down into spectral regions on timescales of several years. Methods: We use the SATIRE model and compare modeled total solar irradiance (TSI) with TSI measurements between 2003 and 2009. Spectral solar irradiance over 200-1630nm is compared with the SIM instrument on SORCE between 2004 and 2009 during a period of decline from moderate activity to the recent solar minimum in 10 nm bands and for three spectral regions of significant interest: the UV integrated over 200-300nm, the visible over 400-691nm and the IR between 972-1630 nm. Results: The model captures 97% of observed TSI variation. In the spectral comparison, rotational variability is well reproduced, especially between 400 and 1200 nm. The magnitude of change in the long-term trends is many times larger in SIM at almost all wavelengths while trends in SIM oppose SATIRE in the visible between 500 and 700nm and between 1000 and 1200nm. We discuss the remaining issues with both SIM data and the identified limits of the model, particularly with the way facular contributions are dealt with, the limit of flux identification in MDI magnetograms during solar minimum and the model atmospheres in the IR employed by SATIRE. It is unlikely that improvements in these areas will significantly enhance the agreement in the long-term trends. This disagreement implies that some mechanism other than surface magnetism is causing SSI variations, in particular between 2004 and 2006, if the SIM data are correct. Since SATIRE was able to reproduce UV irradiance between 1991 and 2002 from UARS, either the solar mechanism for SSI variation fundamentally changed around the peak of cycle 23, or there is an inconsistency between UARS and SORCE UV measurements. We favour the second explanation. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Martin-Zaidi,  W.-F. Thi,  C. Pinte,  F. Massi,  G. Weigelt,  K.-H. Hofmann,  R. G. Petrov;  Studying the physical conditions in circumstellar disks is a crucial step toward understanding planet formation. Of particular interest is the case of HD 100546, a Herbig Be star that presents a gap within the first 13 AU of its protoplanetary disk, that may originate in the dynamical interactions of a forming planet. We gathered a large amount of new interferometric data using the AMBER/VLTI instrument in the H- and K-bands to spatially resolve the warm inner disk and constrain its structure. Then, combining these measurements with photometric observations, we analyze the circumstellar environment of HD 100546 in the light of a passive disk model based on 3D Monte-Carlo radiative transfer. Finally, we use hydrodynamical simulations of gap formation by planets to predict the radial surface density profile of the disk and test the hypothesis of ongoing planet formation. The SED and the NIR interferometric data are adequately reproduced by our model. We show that the H- and K-band emissions are coming mostly from the inner edge of the internal dust disk, located near 0.24 AU from the star, i.e., at the dust sublimation radius in our model. We directly measure an inclination of $33^{\circ} \pm 11^{\circ}$ and a position angle of $140^{\circ} \pm 16^{\circ}$ for the inner disk. This is similar to the values found for the outer disk ($i \simeq 42^{\circ}$, $PA \simeq 145^{\circ}$), suggesting that both disks may be coplanar. We finally show that 1 to 8 Jupiter mass planets located at $\sim 8$ AU from the star would have enough time to create the gap and the required surface density jump of three orders of magnitude between the inner and outer disk. However, no information on the amount of matter left in the gap is available, which precludes us from setting precise limits on the planet mass, for now. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)"

Casewell,  M. A. Barstow;  The planet-hosting and Sirius-type binary system epsilon Reticulum (HD 27442) is examined from the perspective of its more evolved white dwarf secondary. The stellar parameters are determined from a combination of Balmer line spectroscopy, gravitational redshift, and solid angle. These three methods conspire to yield the most accurate physical description of the companion to date: Teff=15,310 \pm 350 K and M=0.60 \pm 0.02 Msol. Post-main sequence mass loss indicates the current binary separation has increased by a factor of 1.6 from its primordial state when the current primary was forming its planet(s), implying a0 > 150 AU and constraining stable planets to within 15-20 AU for a binary eccentricity of e=0.5. Almost 80 years have passed since the first detection of the stellar companion, and marginal orbital motion may be apparent in the binary, suggesting a near edge-on configuration with i > 70 deg, albeit with substantial uncertainty. If correct, and all known bodies are coplanar, the mass of the planet HD 27442b is bound between 1.66 and 1.77 Mjup. A search for photospheric metals in the DA white dwarf yields no detections, and hence there is no clear signature of an extant planetary system orbiting the previously more massive secondary. However, if the white dwarf mass derived via spectral fitting is correct, its evolution could have been influenced by interactions with inner planets during the asymptotic giant branch. Based on the frequency of giant planets and circumstellar debris as a function of stellar mass, it is unlikely that the primordial primary would be void of planets, given at least one orbiting its less massive sibling. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)"

The observed 1-D projection images in the lines can be reasonably explained by a model in which the CO gas within a region more than half as large as the stellar size is moving slightly outward with 0--5 km s^-1, while the gas in the remaining region is infalling fast with 20--30 km s^-1. A comparison between the CO line AMBER data taken in 2008 and 2009 shows a significant time variation in the dynamics of the CO line-forming region in the photosphere and the outer atmosphere. In contrast to the line data, the reconstructed 1-D projection images in the continuum show only a slight deviation from a uniform disk or limb-darkened disk. We derive a uniform-disk diameter of 42.05 +/- 0.05 mas and a power-law-type limb-darkened disk diameter of 42.49 +/- 0.06 mas and a limb-darkening parameter of (9.7 +/- 0.5) x 10^{-2}. This latter angular diameter leads to an effective temperature of 3690 +/- 54 K for the continuum-forming layer. These diameters confirm that the near-IR size of Betelgeuse was nearly constant over the last 18 years, in marked contrast to the recently reported noticeable decrease in the mid-IR size. The continuum data taken in 2008 and 2009 reveal no or only marginal time variations, much smaller than the maximum variation predicted by the current 3-D convection simulations. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

We call this program the Z CamPaign. Since there is no strong agreement between the various published catalogues as to which few dozen DNe are actually Z Cam type systems, our primary goal is to accumulate enough data to construct detailed light curves, covering the entire range of variability, to determine unequivocally the 30 Z CamPaign subjects' membership in the UGZ class of DNe.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.1016;Stokes tomography of radio pulsar magnetospheres. II. Millisecond  pulsars; C. T. Y. Chung,  A. Melatos;  The radio polarization characteristics of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) differ significantly from those of non-recycled pulsars. In particular, the position angle (PA) swings of many MSPs deviate from the S-shape predicted by the rotating vector model, even after relativistic aberration is accounted for, indicating that they have non-dipolar magnetic geometries, likely due to a history of accretion. Stokes tomography uses phase portraits of the Stokes parameters as a diagnostic tool to infer a pulsar's magnetic geometry and orientation. This paper applies Stokes tomography to MSPs, generalizing the technique to handle interpulse emission. We present an atlas of look-up tables for the Stokes phase portraits and PA swings of MSPs with current-modified dipole fields, filled core and hollow cone beams, and two empirical linear polarization models. We compare our look-up tables to data from 15 MSPs and find that the Stokes phase portraits for a current-modified dipole approximately match several MSPs whose PA swings are flat or irregular and cannot be reconciled with the standard axisymmetric rotating vector model. PSR J1939+2134 and PSR J0437$-$4715 are modelled in detail. The data from PSR J1939+2134 at 0.61\,GHz can be fitted well with a current-modified dipole at $(\alpha, i) = (22 \pm 2^\circ, 80 \pm 1^\circ)$ and emission altitude 0.4 $r_\text{LC}$. The fit is less accurate for PSR J1939+2134 at 1.414\,GHz, and for PSR J0437$-$4715 at 1.44\,GHz, indicating that these objects may have a more complicated magnetic field geometry, such as a localized surface anomaly or a polar magnetic mountain. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

We assume that the extra-element mixing can be treated as a diffusion process, with the diffusion coefficient depending mainly on the solar internal configuration of rotation and magnetic fields. We find that such models can well reproduce the observed solar rotation profile in the radiative region. Furthermore the proposed models can match the seismic constraints better than the standard solar models, also when these include the latest abundances, but neglect the effects of rotation and magnetic fields. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Privitera,  R. Manso Sainz;  The presence of magnetic fields is an attractive hypothesis for shaping PNe. We report on observations of the central star of the two Planetary Nebulae NGC1360 and LSS1326. We performed spectroscopy on circularly polarized light with the FOcal Reducer and low dispersion Spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope of the European Southern Observatory. Contrary to previous reports (Jordan et al. 2005, A&A, 432, 273), we find that the effective magnetic field, that is the average over the visible stellar disk of longitudinal components of the magnetic fields, is null within errors for both stars. We conclude that a direct evidence of magnetic fields on the central stars of PNe is still missing --- either the magnetic field is much weaker (< 600 G) than previously reported, or more complex (thus leading to cancellations), or both. Certainly, indirect evidences (e.g., MASER emission) fully justify further efforts to study the strength and morphology of such magnetic fields. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Walsh;  Spectroscopic and stereoscopic imaging observations of slow magnetoacoustic wave propagation within a coronal loop are investigated to determine the decay length scale of the slow magnetoacoustic mode in three dimensions and the density profile within the loop system. The slow wave is found to have an e-folding decay length scale of $20,000^{+4000}_{-3000}$km with a uniform density profile along the loop base. These observations place quantitive constraints on the modelling of wave propagation within coronal loops. Theoretical forward modelling suggests that magnetic field line divergence is the dominant damping factor and thermal conduction is insufficient, given the observed parameters of the coronal loop temperature, density and wave mode period. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Hence, some heating process is expected to exist during that time. The better energy resolution of RHESSI compared to HXT allow us to analyse LDEs in more comprehensive way. Aims: We selected three LDEs observed by RHESSI to answer the questions how long HXR emission can be present, where it is emitted, what is its nature and how much energy should be released to sustain the emission. Methods: We used RHESSI data to reconstruct images of the selected flares with an energy resolution as good as 1 keV. Next we estimated physical parameters of HXR sources through imaging spectroscopy. The physical parameters obtained were then used to calculate the energy balance of the observed sources. Results: We found that HXR thermal emission can be present for many hours after LDE flare maximum. The emission comes from large and hot loop-top sources. The total energy that must be released to sustain the emission of the sources is as high as 10^31 erg. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.1180;The cataclysmic variable SDSS J1507+52: An eclipsing period bouncer in  the Galactic halo; Helena Uthas,  Christian Knigge,  Knox S. Long,  Joseph Patterson,  John Thorstensen;  SDSS J1507+52 is an eclipsing cataclysmic variable consisting of a cool, non-radially pulsating white dwarf and an unusually small sub-stellar secondary. The system has a high space velocity and a very short orbital period of about 67 minutes, well below the usual minimum period for CVs. To explain the existence of this peculiar system, two theories have been proposed. One suggests that SDSS J1507+52 was formed from a detached white-dwarf/brown-dwarf binary. The other theory proposes that the system is a member of the Galactic halo-population. Here, we present ultraviolet spectroscopy of SDSS J1507+52 obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope with the aim of distinguishing between these two theories. The UV flux of the system is dominated by emission from the accreting white dwarf. Fits to model stellar atmospheres yield physical parameter estimates of T(eff) = 14200 \pm 500 K, log(g)=8.2 \pm 0.3, vsin(i)=180 \pm 20 kms-1 and [Fe/H]=-1.2 \pm 0.2. These fits suggest a distance towards SDSS J1507+52 of d = 250 \pm 50 pc. The quoted uncertainties include systematic errors associated with the adopted fitting windows and interstellar reddening. Assuming that there is no contribution to the UV flux from a hot, optically thick boundary layer, we find a T(eff) much higher than previously estimated from eclipse analysis. The strongly sub-solar metallicity we infer for SDSS J1507+52 is consistent with that of halo stars at the same space velocity. We therefore conclude that SDSS J1507+52 is a member of the Galactic halo. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.1218;Radiation-Hydrodynamic Simulations of Massive Star Formation with  Protostellar Outflows; Andrew J. Cunningham,  Richard I. Klein,  Mark R. Krumholz,  Christopher F. McKee;  We report the results of a series of AMR radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of the collapse of massive star forming clouds using the ORION code. These simulations are the first to include the feedback effects protostellar outflows, as well as protostellar radiative heating and radiation pressure exerted on the infalling, dusty gas. We find that that outflows evacuate polar cavities of reduced optical depth through the ambient core. These enhance the radiative flux in the poleward direction so that it is 1.7 to 15 times larger than that in the midplane. As a result the radiative heating and outward radiation force exerted on the protostellar disk and infalling cloud gas in the equatorial direction are greatly diminished. The simultaneously reduces the Eddington radiation pressure barrier to high-mass star formation and increases the minimum threshold surface density for radiative heating to suppress fragmentation compared to models that do not include outflows. The strength of both these effects depends on the initial core surface density. Lower surface density cores have longer free-fall times and thus massive stars formed within them undergo more Kelvin contraction as the core collapses, leading to more powerful outflows. Furthermore, in lower surface density clouds the ratio of the time required for the outflow to break out of the core to the core free-fall time is smaller, so that these clouds are consequently influenced by outflows at earlier stages of collapse. As a result, outflow effects are strongest in low surface density cores and weakest in high surface density one. We also find that radiation focusing in the direction of outflow cavities is sufficient to prevent the formation of radiation pressure-supported circumstellar gas bubbles, in contrast to models which neglect protostellar outflow feedback. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Anfinogentov;  The paper presents the possibility of fast and quality azimuth disambiguation of vector magnetogram data regardless of location on the solar disc. The new Super Fast and Quality (SFQ) code of disambiguation is tried out on well-known models of Metcalf et al. (2006), Leka et al. (2009) and artificial model of fixed configuration AR 10930 (Rudenko et al., 2010). We make comparison of Hinode SOT SP vector magnetograms of AR 10930 disambiguated with three codes: SFQ, NPFC (Georgoulis, 2005), and SME (Rudenko et al., 2010). We exemplify the SFQ disambiguation of SDO/HMI measurements of the full disc. The preliminary examination indicates that the SFQ algorithm provides better quality than NPFC and is comparable to SME. In contrast to other codes, SFQ supports relatively high quality of results regardless of the magnetogram proximity to the limb (when being very close to the limb, it is efficient unlike all other algorithms). ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Mampaso;  We are performing a search for symbiotic stars using IPHAS, the INT Halpha survey of the northern Galactic plane, and follow-up observations. Candidate symbiotic stars are selected on the basis of their IPHAS and near-IR colours, and spectroscopy and photometry are obtained to determine their nature. We present here observations of the symbiotic star candidate IPHAS J205836.43+503307.2. The optical spectrum shows the combination of a number of emission lines, among which are the high-excitation species of [OIII], HeII, [Ca V], and [Fe VII], and a red continuum with the features of a star at the cool end of the carbon star sequence. The nebular component is spatially resolved: the analysis of the spatial profile of the [NII]6583 line in the spectrum indicates a linear size of ~2.5 arcsec along the east-west direction. Its velocity structure suggests an aspherical morphology. The near-infrared excess of the source, which was especially strong in 1999, indicated that a thick circumstellar dust shell was also present in the system. The carbon star has brightened in the last decade by two to four magnitudes at red and near-infrared wavelengths. Photometric monitoring during a period of 60 days from November 2010 to January 2011 reveals a slow luminosity decrease of 0.2 magnitudes. From the observed spectrophotometric properties and variability, we conclude that the source is a new Galactic symbiotic star of the D-type, of the rare kind that contains a carbon star, likely a carbon Mira. Only two other systems of this type are known in the Galaxy. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Spielfiedel;"  The influence of inelastic hydrogen atom collisions on non-LTE spectral line formation has been, and remains to be, a significant source of uncertainty for stellar abundance analyses, due to the difficulty in obtaining accurate data for low-energy atomic collisions either experimentally or theoretically. For lack of a better alternative, the classical ""Drawin formula"" is often used. Over recent decades, our understanding of these collisions has improved markedly, predominantly through a number of detailed quantum mechanical calculations. In this paper, the Drawin formula is compared with the quantum mechanical calculations both in terms of the underlying physics and the resulting rate coefficients. It is shown that the Drawin formula does not contain the essential physics behind direct excitation by H atom collisions, the important physical mechanism being quantum mechanical in character. Quantitatively, the Drawin formula compares poorly with the results of the available quantum mechanical calculations, usually significantly overestimating the collision rates by amounts that vary markedly between transitions.

Ragland,  M. Hrynevych,  J. Woillez,  K. Stapelfeldt,  G. Bryden,  M. M. Colavita,  A. J. Booth;  The Keck Interferometer Nuller (KIN) was used to survey 25 nearby main sequence stars in the mid-infrared, in order to assess the prevalence of warm circumstellar (exozodiacal) dust around nearby solar-type stars. The KIN measures circumstellar emission by spatially blocking the star but transmitting the circumstellar flux in a region typically 0.1 - 4 AU from the star. We find one significant detection (eta Crv), two marginal detections (gamma Oph and alpha Aql), and 22 clear non-detections. Using a model of our own Solar System's zodiacal cloud, scaled to the luminosity of each target star, we estimate the equivalent number of target zodis needed to match our observations. Our three zodi detections are eta Crv (1250 +/- 260), gamma Oph (200 +/- 80) and alpha Aql (600 +/- 200), where the uncertainties are 1-sigma. The 22 non-detected targets have an ensemble weighted average consistent with zero, with an average individual uncertainty of 160 zodis (1-sigma). These measurements represent the best limits to date on exozodi levels for a sample of nearby main sequence stars. A statistical analysis of the population of 23 stars not previously known to contain circumstellar dust (excluding eta Crv and gamma Oph) suggests that, if the measurement errors are uncorrelated (for which we provide evidence) and if these 23 stars are representative of a single class with respect to the level of exozodi brightness, the mean exozodi level for the class is <150 zodis (3-sigma upper-limit, corresponding to 99% confidence under the additional assumption that the measurement errors are Gaussian). We also demonstrate that this conclusion is largely independent of the shape and mean level of the (unknown) true underlying exozodi distribution. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Using RHESSI data we try to answer two following questions. How effective are these processes at the LDEs decay phase and how can precisely the energy release rate be calculated based on these data? To answer the questions images of the selected LDEs during their decay phase were reconstructed. Physical parameters of flare coronal sources obtained from image spectral analysis allowed us to study the efficiency of the energy release process. We also examined terms included in the energy equation to find out what is the accuracy of determination of each term. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

We complement these data with one epoch of M-band observations from MMT/AO Clio, which reach comparable performance. No dataset reveals any companion candidates above the 5-sigma level, allowing us to refute the existence of Sirius C as suggested by the previous astrometric analysis. Furthermore, our Br alpha photometry of Sirius B confirms the lack of an infrared excess beyond the white dwarf's blackbody spectrum.

Lisse (Johns Hopkins University/APL),  Aurora Sicilia-Aguilar (MPIA-Heidelberg),  George H. Rieke (Arizona),  Kate Su (Arizona);  We describe Spitzer IRS spectroscopic observations of the 10 Myr-old star, EF Cha. Compositional modeling of the spectra from 5 {\mu}m to 35 {\mu}m confirms that it is surrounded by a luminous debris disk with LD/L\star ~ 10-3, containing dust with temperatures between 225 K and 430 K characteristic of the terrestrial zone. The EF Cha spectrum shows evidence for many solid-state features, unlike most cold, low-luminosity debris disks but like some other 10-20 Myr-old luminous, warm debris disks (e.g. HD 113766A). The EF Cha debris disk is unusually rich in a species or combination of species whose emissivities resemble that of finely powdered, laboratory-measured phyllosilicate species (talc, saponite, and smectite), which are likely produced by aqueous alteration of primordial anhydrous rocky materials. The dust and, by inference, the parent bodies of the debris also contain abundant amorphous silicates and metal sulfides, and possibly water ice. The dust's total olivine to pyroxene ratio of ~ 2 also provides evidence of aqueous alteration. The large mass volume of grains with sizes comparable to or below the radiation blow-out limit implies that planetesimals may be colliding at a rate high enough to yield the emitting dust but not so high as to devolatize the planetesimals via impact processing. Because phyllosilicates are produced by the interactions between anhydrous rock and warm, reactive water, EF Cha's disk is a likely signpost for water delivery to the terrestrial zone of a young planetary system. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.1433;Mean-field solar dynamo models with strong meridional flow at the bottom  of the convection zone; V.V. Pipin,  A.G. Kosovichev;  The paper presents a study of kinematic axisymmetric mean-field dynamo models for a case of the meridional circulation with a deep-seated stagnation point and a strong return flow at the bottom of the convection zone. This kind of circulation follows from mean-field models of the angular momentum balance in the solar convection zone. We show that it is possible for this types of meridional circulation to construct kinematic dynamo models that resemble in some aspects the sunspot magnetic activity cycle. The dynamo model includes turbulent sources of the large-scale poloidal magnetic field production, due to kinetic helicity and a combined effect due to Coriolis force and the large-scale current. In these models the toroidal magnetic field, which is responsible for the sunspot production, is concentrated at the bottom of the convection zone, and is transported to low-latitude regions by the meridional flow. The meridional component of the poloidal field is also concentrated at the bottom of the convection zone while the radial component is concentrated in near polar regions. There are some issues which, perhaps, are resulted from the given meridional circulation pattern and the distribution of the magnetic diffusivity inside convection zone. In particular, in the near-equatorial regions the phase relations between the toroidal and poloidal components disagree with observations. Also, we show that the period of the magnetic cycle may not always monotonically decrease with the increase of the meridional flow speed. Thus, for the further progress it is important to determine the structure of the meridional circulation, which is one of the critical properties, from helioseismology observations. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Troe;  Context: Dark cloud chemical models usually predict large amounts of O2, often above observational limits. Aims: We investigate the reason for this discrepancy from a theoretical point of view, inspired by the studies of Jenkins and Whittet on oxygen depletion. Methods: We use the gas-grain code Nautilus with an up-to-date gas-phase network to study the sensitivity of the molecular oxygen abundance to the oxygen elemental abundance. We use the rate coefficient for the reaction O + OH at 10 K recommended by the KIDA (KInetic Database for Astrochemistry) experts. Results: The updates of rate coefficients and branching ratios of the reactions of our gas-phase chemical network, especially N + CN and H3+ + O, have changed the model sensitivity to the oxygen elemental abundance. In addition, the gas-phase abundances calculated with our gas-grain model are less sensitive to the elemental C/O ratio than those computed with a pure gas-phase model. The grain surface chemistry plays the role of a buffer absorbing most of the extra carbon. Finally, to reproduce the low abundance of molecular oxygen observed in dark clouds at all times, we need an oxygen elemental abundance smaller than 1.6E-4. Conclusion: The chemistry of molecular oxygen in dense clouds is quite sensitive to model parameters that are not necessarily well constrained. That O2 abundance may be sensitive to nitrogen chemistry is an indication of the complexity of interstellar chemistry. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

The brightness of the star at spectral region from 3015 to 3138 A is constant over the period of rotation which means that the so called 'null wavelength region' exist on these wavelengths. Moreover, the minima values of the amplitude of light curves are reached in the spectral region at \lambda \lambda 1660 and 1900 A. The monochromatic light curves in the 'pseudo-continuum' of this star change their shape with wavelength. All light curves with \lambda < 2505 A have a similar shape, but the monochromatic light curves with \lambda > 2505 A shows the phase displacement of the minimum from 0.0 at \lambda 2505 A to 0.3 at \lambda 2993 A. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.1615;Observations of Detailed Structure in the Solar Wind at 1 AU with  STEREO/HI-2; Craig DeForest,  Tim Howard,  James Tappin;"  Heliospheric imagers offer the promise of remote sensing of large-scale structures present in the solar wind. The STEREO/HI-2 imagers, in particular, offer high resolution, very low noise observations of the inner heliosphere but have not yet been exploited to their full potential. This is in part because the signal of interest, Thomson scattered sunlight from free electrons, is ~1000 times fainter than the background visual field in the images, making background subtraction challenging. We have developed a procedure for separating the Thomson-scattered signal from the other background/foreground sources in the HI-2 data. Using only the Level 1 data from STEREO/HI-2, we are able to generate calibrated imaging data of the solar wind with sensitivity of a few times 1e-17 Bsun, compared to the background signal of a few times 1e-13 Bsun. These images reveal detailed spatial structure in CMEs and the solar wind at projected solar distances in excess of 1 AU, at the instrumental motion-blur resolution limit of 1-3 degree. CME features visible in the newly reprocessed data from December 2008 include leading-edge pileup, interior voids, filamentary structure, and rear cusps. ""Quiet"" solar wind features include V shaped structure centered on the heliospheric current sheet, plasmoids, and ""puffs"" that correspond to the density fluctuations observed in-situ. We compare many of these structures with in-situ features detected near 1 AU. The reprocessed data demonstrate that it is possible to perform detailed structural analyses of heliospheric features with visible light imagery, at distances from the Sun of at least 1 AU.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.1638;The Cepheid mass discrepancy and pulsation-driven mass loss; Hilding R. Neilson,  Matteo Cantiello,  Norbert Langer (AIfA);  Context. A longstanding challenge for understanding classical Cepheids is the Cepheid mass discrepancy, where theoretical mass estimates using stellar evolution and stellar pulsation calculations have been found to differ by approximately 10 - 20%. Aims. We study the role of pulsation-driven mass loss during the Cepheid stage of evolution as a possible solution to this mass discrepancy. Methods. We computed stellar evolution models with a Cepheid mass-loss prescription and various amounts of convective core overshooting. The contribution of mass loss towards the mass discrepancy is determined using these models, Results. Pulsation-driven mass loss is found to trap Cepheid evolution on the instability strip, allowing them to lose about 5 - 10% of their total mass when moderate convective core overshooting, an amount consistent with observations of other stars, is included in the stellar models. Conclusions. We find that the combination of moderate convective core overshooting and pulsation-driven mass loss can solve the Cepheid mass discrepancy. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.1639;Solar models with accretion. I. Application to the solar abundance  problem; Aldo M. Serenelli,  Wick C. Haxton,  Carlos Pena-Garay;  We generate new standard solar models using newly analyzed nuclear fusion cross sections and present results for helioseismic quantities and solar neutrino fluxes. We discuss the status of the solar abundance problem and investigate whether nonstandard solar models with accretion from the protoplanetary disk might alleviate the problem. We examine a broad range of possibilities, analyzing both metal-enriched and metal-depleted accretion models and exploring three scenarios for the timing of the accretion. Only partial solutions are found: one can bring either the depth of the convective zone or the surface helium abundance into agreement with helioseismic results, but not both simultaneously. In addition, detailed results for solar neutrino fluxes show that neutrinos are a competitive source of information about the solar core and can help constrain possible accretion histories of the Sun. Finally, we briefly discuss how measurements of solar neutrinos from the CN-cycle could shed light on the interaction between the early Sun and its protoplanetary disk. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.1659;Amplitudes of solar-like oscillations: a new scaling relation; Hans Kjeldsen,  Timothy R. Bedding;  Solar-like oscillations are excited by near-surface convection and are being observed in growing numbers of stars using ground and space-based telescopes. We have previously suggested an empirical scaling relation to predict their amplitudes (Kjeldsen and Bedding 1995). This relation has found widespread use but it predicts amplitudes in F-type stars that are higher than observed. Here we present a new scaling relation that is based on the postulate that the power in velocity fluctuations due to p-mode oscillations scales with stellar parameters in the same way as the power in velocity fluctuations due to granulation. The new relation includes a dependence on the damping rate via the mode lifetime and should be testable using observations from the CoRoT and Kepler missions. We also suggest scaling relations for the properties of the background power due to granulation and argue that both these and the amplitude relations should be applicable to red giant stars. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Huard,  Claudia Knez,  Brian Prager,  Neal J. Evans II;  We present Spitzer Space Telescope IRAC and MIPS observations of a 0.85 deg^2 field including the Corona Australis (CrA) star-forming region. At a distance of 130 pc, CrA is one of the closest regions known to be actively forming stars, particularly within its embedded association, the Coronet. Using the Spitzer data, we identify 51 young stellar objects (YSOs) in CrA which include sources in the well-studied Coronet cluster as well as distributed throughout the molecular cloud. Twelve of the YSOs discussed are new candidates, one of which is located in the Coronet. Known YSOs retrieved from the literature are also added to the list, and a total of 116 candidate YSOs in CrA are compiled. Based on these YSO candidates, the star formation rate is computed to be 12 M_o Myr^-1, similar to that of the Lupus clouds. A clustering analysis was also performed, finding that the main cluster core, consisting of 68 members, is elongated (having an aspect ratio of 2.36), with a circular radius of 0.59 pc and mean surface density of 150 pc^-2. In addition, we analyze outflows and jets in CrA by means of new CO and H_2 data. We present 1.3 mm interferometric continuum observations made with the Submillimeter Array (SMA) covering R CrA, IRS 5, IRS 7, and IRAS 18595-3712 (IRAS 32). We also present multi-epoch H_2 maps and detect jets and outflows, study their proper motions, and identify exciting sources. The Spitzer and ISAAC/VLT observations of IRAS 32 show a bipolar precessing jet, which drives a CO (2-1) outflow detected in the SMA observations. There is also clear evidence for a parsec-scale precessing outflow, E-W oriented, and originating in the SMA 2 region, likely driven by SMA 2 or IRS 7A. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Benkő,  M. Paparó;  We present the analysis of the CoRoT star 105288363, a new Blazhko RR Lyrae star of type RRab (f0 = 1.7623 c/d), observed with the CoRoT space craft during the second long run in direction of the galactic center (LRc02, time base 145 d). The CoRoT data are characterized by an excellent time sampling and a low noise amplitude of 0.07 mmag in the 2-12 c/d range and allow us to study not only the fine details of the variability of the star but also long-term changes in the pulsation behaviour and the stability of the Blazhko cycle. We use, among other methods, standard Fourier analysis techniques and O-C diagrams to investigate the pulsational behavior of the Blazhko star 105288363. In addition to the frequency pattern expected for a Blazhko RR Lyrae star, we find an independent mode (f1 = 2.984 c/d) showing a f0/f1 ratio of 0.59 which is similar to that observed in other Blazhko RR Lyrae stars. The bump and hump phenomena are also analysed, with their variations over the Blazhko cycle. We carefully investigated the strong cycle-to-cycle changes in the Blazhko modulation (PB = 35.6 d), which seem to happen independently and partly diametrically in the amplitude and the phase modulation. Furthermore, the phasing between the two types of modulation is found to change during the course of the observations. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.1791;Spatial Damping of Propagating Kink Waves Due to Resonant Absorption:  Effect of Background Flow; Roberto Soler,  Jaume Terradas,  Marcel Goossens;  Observations show the ubiquitous presence of propagating magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) kink waves in the solar atmosphere. Waves and flows are often observed simultaneously. Due to plasma inhomogeneity in the perpendicular direction to the magnetic field, kink waves are spatially damped by resonant absorption. The presence of flow may affect the wave spatial damping. Here, we investigate the effect of longitudinal background flow on the propagation and spatial damping of resonant kink waves in transversely nonuniform magnetic flux tubes. We combine approximate analytical theory with numerical investigation. The analytical theory uses the thin tube (TT) and thin boundary (TB) approximations to obtain expressions for the wavelength and the damping length. Numerically, we verify the previously obtained analytical expressions by means of the full solution of the resistive MHD eigenvalue problem beyond the TT and TB approximations. We find that the backward and forward propagating waves have different wavelengths and are damped on length scales that are inversely proportional to the frequency as in the static case. However, the factor of proportionality depends on the characteristics of the flow, so that the damping length differs from its static analogue. For slow, sub-Alfvenic flows the backward propagating wave gets damped on a shorter length scale than in the absence of flow, while for the forward propagating wave the damping length is longer. The different properties of the waves depending on their direction of propagation with respect to the background flow may be detected by the observations and may be relevant for seismological applications. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Spectral lines of the stellar wind regions can be classified into four physically distinct categories: 1) low-excitation emission such as H I and Fe II, 2) higher excitation He I features, 3) the N II lines discussed in this paper, and 4) He II emission. These categories have different combinations of radial velocity behavior, excitation processes, and dependences on the secondary star. The N II lines are the only known features that originate in ""normal"" undisturbed zones of the primary wind but depend primarily on the location of the hot secondary star. N II probably excludes some proposed models, such as those where He I lines originate in the secondary star's wind or in an accretion disk. ";Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.1957;Bimodal Brightness Oscillations in Models of Young Binary Systems; T. Demidova,  N. Sotnikova,  V. Grinin;  We consider a model for the cyclic activity of young binary stars that accrete matter from the remnants of a protostellar cloud. If the orbit of such a binary system is inclined at a small angle to the line of sight, then the streams of matter and the density waves excited in the circumbinary disk can screen the primary component of the binary from the observer. To study these phenomena by the SPH (smoothed particle hydrodynamics) method, we have computed grids of hydrodynamic models for binary systems based on which we have constructed the light curves as a function of the orbital phase.The main emphasis is on investigating the properties of the brightness oscillations. Therefore, the model parameters were varied within the following ranges: the component mass ratio q = M2 : M1 = 0.2 - 0.5 and the eccentricity e = 0 - 0.7. The parameter that defined the binary viscosity was also varied. We adopted optical grain characteristics typical of circumstellar dust. Our computations have shown that bimodal oscillations are excited in binaries with eccentric orbits, provided that the binary components do not differ too much in mass. In this case, the ratios of the periods and amplitudes of the bimodal oscillations and their shape depend strongly on the inclination of the binary plane and its orientation relative to the observer. Our analysis shows that the computed light curves can be used in interpreting the cyclic activity of UX Ori stars. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2179;Apsidal motion of the eclipsing binary AS Camelopardalis: discrepancy  resolved; K. Pavlovski,  J. Southworth,  V. Kolbas;  We present a spectroscopic study of the eclipsing binary system AS Camelopardalis, the first such study based on phase-resolved CCD echelle spectra. Via a spectral disentangling analysis we measure the minimum masses of the stars to be M_A sin^3 i = 3.213 +/- 0.007 M_sun and M_B sin^3 i = 2.323 +/- 0.006 M_sun, their effective temperatures to be T_eff(A) = 12840 +/- 120 K and T_eff(B) = 10580 +/- 240 K, and their projected rotational velocities to be v_A sin i_A = 14.5 +/- 0.1 km/s and v_B sin i_B = 4.6 +/- 0.1 km/s. These projected rotational velocities appear to be much lower than the synchronous values. We show that measurements of the apsidal motion of the system suffer from a degeneracy between orbital eccentricity and apsidal motion rate. We use our spectroscopically-measured e = 0.164 +/- 0.001 to break this degeneracy and measure (d omega_obs / dt) = 0.133 +/- 0.010 deg/yr. Subtracting the relativistic contribution of (d omega_GR / dt) = 0.0963 +/- 0.0002 deg/yr yields the contribution due to tidal torques: (d omega_cl / dt) = 0.037 +/- 0.010 deg/yr. This value is much smaller than the rate predicted by stellar theory, 0.40--0.87 deg/yr. We interpret this as a misalignment between the orbital axis of the close binary and the rotational axes of its component stars, which also explains their apparently low rotational velocities. The observed and predicted apsidal motion rates could be brought into agreement if the stars were rotating three times faster than synchronous about axes perpendicular to the orbital axis. Measurement of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect can be used to confirm this interpretation. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2185;A quantitative analysis of stellar activity based on CoRoT photometric  data; J.C. Hulot,  F. Baudin,  R. Samadi,  M.J. Goupil;"  The CoRoT satellite has made available high precision photometric observations of a large number of stars of different spectral types. Continuous photometric time series allow the characterization of stellar microvariability in a systematic way. We determine an index indicating the level of activity, derived from photometric data, for a large sample of stars with different color temperatures. We also assess to what extent this index can be related to an estimated Rossby number for stars whose rotation period can be estimated. We also estimate a characteristic lifetime of the surface heterogeneities. Our work is based on the Fourier analysis of stellar light curves. We analyzed the Fourier power spectra of 430 selected light curves obtained by CoRoT during three observation runs. The low-frequency contribution of the stellar variability is modelled by a ""generalized semi-lorentzian"" profile. An activity index is derived from the fitted amplitude and width of the semi-lorentzian model. Some of the Fourier spectra exhibit a rotational modulation which enables the determination of the rotation period. In addition, a convective turnover time is derived from a grid of stellar models, so that a Rossby number can be estimated. A characteristic lifetime of the phenomena causing the observed power at low frequency is assessed from the fitted model of the power spectrum and is compared to the rotation period. Higher values of the microvariability index are observed among the coolest stars from our sample. 28 light curves show a clear rotational modulation. The estimated Rossby number of most of the observed stars with a rotational modulation is less than 1. The activity index decreases with increasing Rossby number. The quality of the CoRoT data enables the determination of the characteristic lifetime of active structures. It is shown to increase with the rotation period.

Thorwirth,  K.-T. Kim;  Context: High-mass star formation has been a very active field over the last decade, however, most studies targeted regions of luminosities between 10^4 and 10^5 L_sun. Methods: We selected the W31 star-forming complex with a total luminosity of ~6x10^6 L_sun for a multi-wavelength spectral line and continuum study covering wavelengths from the near- and mid-infrared via (sub)mm wavelength observations to radio data in the cm regime. Results: While the overall structure of the multi-wavelength continuum data resembles each other well, there are several intriguing differences. The 24mum emission stemming largely from small dust grains follows tightly the spatial structure of the cm emission tracing the ionized free-free emission. Hence warm dust resides in regions that are spatially associated with the ionized hot gas (~10^4 K) of the HII regions. Furthermore, we find several evolutionary stages within the same complexes, ranging from infrared-observable clusters, via deeply embedded regions associated with active star formation traced by 24\,$\mu$m and cm emission, to at least one high-mass gas clump devoid of any such signature. The 13CO(2-1) and C18O(2-1) spectral line observations reveal a large kinematic breadth in the entire region with a total velocity range of approximately 90 km/s. While the average virial mass ratio for W31 is close to unity, the line width analysis indicates large-scale evolutionary differences between the southern and northern sub-regions (G10.2-0.3 and G10.3-0.1) of the whole W31 complex. The clump mass function - tracing cluster scales and not scales of individual stars - derived from the 875mum continuum data has a slope of 1.5+-0.3, consistent with previous cloud mass functions. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Three new relative astrometric positions of the binary were obtained with NACO at the VLT. We combine these with data from the literature and fit orbit models to the dataset. We find that an orbit coplanar with the disk and compatible with the astrometric data is too small to explain the inner gap of the disk. On the other hand, orbits large enough to cause the gap are tilted with respect to the disk. If the disk gap is indeed caused by the stellar companion, then the most likely explanation is a combination of underestimated astrometric errors and a misalignment between the planes of the disk and the orbit. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

We use vector magnetograph data from the Synoptic Optical Long-term Investigations of the Sun survey (SOLIS)/Vector Spectromagnetograph(VSM) to model the coronal magnetic field, where we study three neighbouring magnetically connected active regions (ARs: 10987, 10988, 10989) observed on 28, 29, and 30 March 2008, respectively. We compare the magnetic field topologies and the magnetic energy densities and study the connectivities between the active regions(ARs). We have studied the time evolution of magnetic field over the period of three days and found no major changes in topologies as there was no major eruption event. From this study we have concluded that active regions are much more connected magnetically than the electric current. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Ginsburg;  The detected variety in chemistry and circumstellar shell morphology of the limited sample of Galactic post-AGB stars is so large that there is no consensus yet on how the different objects are linked by evolutionary channels. The evaluation is complicated by the fact that their distances and hence luminosities remain largely unknown. Via cross-correlation of the Spitzer SAGE catalogue with optical catalogues we selected a sample of LMC post-AGB candidates based on their [8]-[24] colour index and estimated luminosity. We determined the fundamental properties of the central stars of 105 of these objects using low-resolution, optical spectra that we obtained at Siding Spring Observatory and SAAO, and constructed a catalogue of 70 high probability and 1337 candidate post-AGB stars that is available at the CDS. The sample forms an ideal testbed for stellar evolution theory predictions of the final phase of low- and intermediate-mass stars, because the distance and hence luminosity and also the current and initial mass of these objects is well constrained. About half of the objects in our sample of post-AGB candidates show a spectral energy distribution (SED) that is indicative of a disc rather than an expanding and cooling AGB remnant. Like in the Galaxy, the disc sources are likely associated with binary evolution. Important side products of this research are catalogues of candidate young stellar objects, candidate supergiants with circumstellar dust, and discarded objects for which a spectrum was obtained. These too are available at the CDS. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Finally, we report on 11 detected pulsation frequencies in HD 134214, 9 of which were never before detected in photometry, and 3 of which are completely new detections.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2298;Plasma Heating During a Coronal Mass Ejection Observed by SOHO; N. A. Murphy,  J. C. Raymond,  K. E. Korreck;"  We perform a time-dependent ionization analysis to constrain plasma heating requirements during a fast partial halo coronal mass ejection (CME) observed on 2000 June 28 by the Ultraviolet Coronagraph Spectrometer (UVCS) aboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). We use two methods to derive densities from the UVCS measurements, including a density sensitive O V line ratio at 1213.85 and 1218.35 Angstroms, and radiative pumping of the O VI 1032,1038 doublet by chromospheric emission lines. The most strongly constrained feature shows cumulative plasma heating comparable to or greater than the kinetic energy, while features observed earlier during the event show cumulative plasma heating of order or less than the kinetic energy. SOHO Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) observations are used to estimate the active region magnetic energy. We consider candidate plasma heating mechanisms and provide constraints when possible. Because this CME was associated with a relatively weak flare, the contribution by flare energy (e.g., through thermal conduction or energetic particles) is probably small; however, the flare may have been partially behind the limb. Wave heating by photospheric motions requires heating rates significantly larger than those previously inferred for coronal holes, but the eruption itself could drive waves which heat the plasma. Heating by small-scale reconnection in the flux rope or by the CME current sheet is not significantly constrained.

Swinyard,  J.A. Yates,  C. Waelkens;  In 2001, the discovery of circumstellar water vapour around the ageing carbon star IRC+10216 was announced. This detection challenged the current understanding of chemistry in old stars, since water vapour was predicted to be absent in carbon-rich stars. Several explanations for the occurrence of water vapour were postulated, including the vaporization of icy bodies (comets or dwarf planets) in orbit around the star, grain surface reactions, and photochemistry in the outer circumstellar envelope. However, the only water line detected so far from one carbon-rich evolved star can not discriminate, by itself, between the different mechanisms proposed. Here we report on the detection by the Herschel satellite of dozens of water vapour lines in the far-infrared and sub-millimetre spectrum of IRC+10216, including some high-excitation lines with energies corresponding to ~1000 K. The emission of these high-excitation water lines can only be explained if water vapour is present in the warm inner region of the envelope. A plausible explanation for the formation of warm water vapour appears to be the penetration of ultraviolet (UV) photons deep into a clumpy circumstellar envelope. This mechanism triggers also the formation of other molecules such as ammonia, whose observed abundances are much higher than hitherto predicted. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2350;Angular Momentum Loss from Cool Stars: An Empirical Expression and  Connection to Stellar Activity; Sydney A. Barnes,  Yong-Cheol Kim;"  We show here that the rotation period data in open clusters allow the empirical determination of an expression for the rate of loss of angular momentum from cool stars on the main sequence. One significant component of the expression, the dependence on rotation rate, persists from prior work; others do not. The expression has a bifurcation, as before, that corresponds to an observed bifurcation in the rotation periods of coeval open cluster stars. The dual dependencies of this loss rate on stellar mass are captured by two functions, $f(B-V)$ and $T(B-V)$, that can be determined from the rotation period observations. Equivalent masses and other [UBVRIJHK] colors are provided in Table 1. Dimensional considerations, and a comparison with appropriate calculated quantities suggest interpretations for $f$ and $T$, both of which appear to be related closely (but differently) to the calculated convective turnover timescale, $\tau_c$, in cool stars. This identification enables us to write down symmetrical expressions for the angular momentum loss rate and the deceleration of cool stars, and also to revive the convective turnover timescale as a vital connection between stellar rotation and stellar activity physics.

Rácz,  Zs. Regály,  R. Szakáts,  N. Szalai,  A. Szing;  We conducted a long-term optical photometric and spectroscopic monitoring of the strongly variable, accreting young sun-like star [KOS94] HA11, associated with the dark cloud Lynds 1340, that exhibited large amplitude (5-6 magnitudes in the I_C band) brightness variations on 2-3 years timescales, flat spectral energy distribution (SED), and extremely strong (300 < EW/Angstrom < 900) H alpha emission. In this Letter we describe the basic properties of the star, derived from our observations between 1999 and 2011, and put into context the observed phenomena. The observed variations in the emission spectra, near-infrared colors, and SED suggest that [KOS94] HA11 (spectral type: K7--M0) is an eruptive young star, possibly similar in nature to V1647 Ori: its large-scale photometric variations are governed by variable accretion rate, associated with variations in the inner disk structure. The star recently has undergone strong and rapid brightness variations, thus its further observations may offer a rare opportunity for studying structural and chemical rearrangements of the inner disk, induced by variable central luminosity. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Low-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy obtained with the Magellan Folded-port InfraRed Echellette (FIRE) reveal strong water and methane absorption in all five sources, and spectral indices and comparison to spectral templates indicate classifications ranging from T5.5 to T8.5:. The spectrum of the latest-type source, WISE J1812+2721, is an excellent match to that of the T8.5 companion brown dwarf Wolf 940B. WISE-based spectrophotometric distance estimates place these T dwarfs at 12-13 pc from the Sun, assuming they are single. Preliminary fits of the spectral data to the atmosphere models of Saumon & Marley indicate effective temperatures ranging from 600 K to 930 K, both cloudy and cloud-free atmospheres, and a broad range of ages and masses. In particular, two sources show evidence of both low surface gravity and cloudy atmospheres, tentatively supporting a trend noted in other young brown dwarfs and exoplanets. In contrast, the high proper motion T dwarf WISE J2018-7423 exhibits a suppressed K-band peak and blue spectrophotometric J-K colors indicative of an old, massive brown dwarf; however, it lacks the broadened Y-band peak seen in metal-poor counterparts. These results illustrate the broad diversity of low-temperature brown dwarfs that will be uncovered with WISE. ";Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Chayer,  P. Bergeron;  We present an analysis of the ultraviolet light curves of five Hot DQ white dwarfs recently observed with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) on board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). These light curves were constructed by extracting the time-tag information from the FUV and NUV spectroscopic data. Single-color light curves were thus produced in 60 s time bins. The Fourier analysis of these data successfully recovers the main pulsation modes of the three stars previously known to be variable from ground-based observations. We also report the discovery of pulsations in another object, SDSS J1153+0056, making it only the fifth member of the new class of variable Hot DQ stars, and the first pulsating white dwarf to be discovered from space-based observations. The relatively high amplitudes of the modes observed in the FUV -- 2 to 4 times that observed in the optical -- as well as the high fraction of stars variable in our sample suggest that most, if not all, Hot DQ white dwarfs might be pulsating at some level when observed at high enough sensitivity. Our results also underline the vast potential of the time-tag capability of the HST/COS combination. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2624;The RHESSI Microflare Height Distribution; Steven Christe,  S Krucker,  Pascal Saint-Hilaire;  We present the first in-depth statistical survey of flare source heights observed by RHESSI. Flares were found using a flare-finding algorithm designed to search the 6-10 keV count-rate when RHESSI's full sensitivity was available in order to find the smallest events (Christe et al., 2008). Between March 2002 and March 2007, a total of 25,006 events were found. Source locations were determined in the 4-10 keV, 10-15 keV, and 15-30 keV energy ranges for each event. In order to extract the height distribution from the observed projected source positions, a forward-fit model was developed with an assumed source height distribution where height is measured from the photosphere. We find that the best flare height distribution is given by g(h) \propto exp(-h/{\lambda}) where {\lambda} = 6.1\pm0.3 Mm is the scale height. A power-law height distribution with a negative power-law index, {\gamma} = 3.1 \pm 0.1 is also consistent with the data. Interpreted as thermal loop top sources, these heights are compared to loops generated by a potential field model (PFSS). The measured flare heights distribution are found to be much steeper than the potential field loop height distribution which may be a signature of the flare energization process. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

The program ZEUS-MP was used for a non-linear 3-D hydrodynamical modeling of a development of a blob of gaseous material injected into an orbit around a star. It resulted in the formation of an elongated disk with a slow prograde revolution. The LTE radiative transfer program SHELLSPEC was used to calculate the H{\alpha} profiles originating in the disk for several phases of its revolution. The profiles have the form of a double emission and exhibit V/R and radial velocity variations. However, these variations should be a temporal phenomenon since imposing a viscosity in given model would lead to a circularization of the disk and fading-out of given variations. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

(1 - Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, University of Manchester, 2 - Max Planck Institut fuer Radioastronomie, 3 - Dept. of Physics, University of West Virginia, 4 - National Radio Astronomy Observatory, Green Bank);  We describe observations of Rotating RAdio Transients (RRATs) that were discovered in a re-analysis of the Parkes Multi-beam Pulsar Survey (PMPS). The sources have now been monitored for sufficiently long to obtain seven new coherent timing solutions, to make a total of 14 now known. Furthermore we announce the discovery of 7 new transient sources, one of which may be extragalactic in origin (with $z\sim0.1$) and would then be a second example of the so-called `Lorimer burst'. The timing solutions allow us to infer neutron star characteristics such as energy-loss rate, magnetic field strength and evolutionary timescales, as well as facilitating multi-wavelength followup by providing accurate astrometry. All of this enables us to consider the question of whether or not RRATs are in any way special, i.e. a distinct and separate population of neutron stars, as has been previously suggested. We see no reason to consider 'RRAT' as anything other than a detection label, the subject of a selection effect in the parameter space searched. However, single-pulse searches can be utilised to great effect to identify pulsars difficult, or impossible, to find by other means, in particular those with long-periods (half of the PMPS RRATs have periods greater than 4 seconds), high-magnetic field strengths ($B\gtrsim 10^{13}$ G) and pulsars approaching the 'death valley'. The detailed nulling properties of such pulsars are unknown but the mounting evidence suggests a broad range of behaviour in the pulsar population. The group of RRATs fit in to the picture where pulsar magnetospheres switch between stable configurations. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Ho,  Ya-Wen Tang;  We report here our search for molecular outflows from young very low mass stars and brown dwarfs in Taurus and rho Ophiuchi. Using the Submillimeter Array (SMA) and the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA), we have observed 4 targets at 1.3 mm wavelength (230 GHz) to search for CO J=2-->1 outflows. A young very low mass star MHO 5 (in Taurus) with an estimated mass of 90 M_J, which is just above the hydrogen-burning limit, shows two gas lobes that are likely outflows. While the CO map of MHO 5 does not show a clear structure of outflow, possibly due to environment gas, its position-velocity diagram indicates two distinct blue- and redshifted components. We therefore conclude that they are components of a bipolar molecular outflow from MHO 5. We estimate an outflow mass of 7.0 x 10^-5 M_Sun and a mass-loss rate of 9.0 x 10^-10 M_Sun. These values are over two orders of magnitude smaller than the typical ones for T Tauri stars and somewhat weaker than those we have observed in the young brown dwarf ISO-Oph 102 of 60 M_J in rho Ophiuchi. This makes MHO~5 the first young very low mass star showing a bipolar molecular outflow in Taurus. The detection boosts the scenario that very low mass objects form like low-mass stars but in a version scaled down by a factor of over 100. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)"

Pradhan (1),  Guo-Xin Chen (2),  Werner Eissner (3) ((1) The Ohio State University, (2) ITAMP, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, (3) Institut fur Theoretische Physik, Stuttgart (Germany));  A comprehensive study of high-accuracy photoionization cross sections is carried out using the relativistic Breit-Pauli R-matrix (BPRM) method for (hnu + Fe XVII --> Fe XVIII + e). Owing to its importance in high-temperature plasmas the calculations cover a large energy range, particularly the myriad photoexciation-of-core (PEC) resonances including the n = 3 levels not heretofore considered. The calculations employ a close coupling wave function expansion of 60 levels of the core ion Fe XVIII ranging over a wide energy range of nearly 900 eV between the n = 2 and n = 3 levels. Strong coupling effects due to dipole transition arrays 2p^5 --> 2p^4 (3s,3d) manifest themselves as large PEC resonances throughout this range, and enhance the effective photoionization cross sections orders of magnitude above the background. Comparisons with the erstwhile Opacity Project (OP) and other previous calculations shows that the currently available cross sections considerably underestimate the bound-free cross sections. A level-identification scheme is used for spectroscopic designation of the 454 bound fine structure levels of Fe XVII. Level-specific photoionization cross sections are computed for all levels. In addition, partial cross sections for leaving the core ion Fe XVII in the ground state are also obtained. These results should be relevant to modeling of astrophysical and laboratory plasma sources requiring (i) photoionization rates, (ii) extensive non-local-thermodynamic-equilibrium models, (iii) total unified electron-ion recombination rates including radiative and dielectronic recombination, and (iv) plasma opacities. We particularly examine PEC and non-PEC resonance strengths and emphasize their expanded role to incorporate inner-shell excitations for improved opacities, as shown by the computed monochromatic opacity of Fe XVII. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph)"

The rotation periods delineate a tight sequence in the NGC6811 color-period diagram from ~1 day at mid-F to ~11 days at early-K spectral type. This result extends to ~1 Gyr similar prior results in the ~600 Myr Hyades and Praesepe clusters, suggesting that rotation periods for cool dwarf stars delineate a well-defined surface in the 3-dimensional space of color (mass), rotation, and age. It implies that reliable ages can be derived for field dwarf stars with measured colors and rotation periods, and it promises to enable further understanding of various aspects of stellar rotation and activity for cool stars. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Meynet;  (abridged) A detailed study of the blue supergiant UIT005 (B2-2.5Ia+) in M33 is presented. The results of our quantitative spectral analysis indicate that the star is a very luminous, log(L/Lsun)~5.9 dex, and massive, M~50 Msun, object, showing a very high nitrogen-to-oxygen ratio in its surface (N/O~8, by mass). Based on the derived Mg and Si abundances, we argue that this high N/O ratio cannot be the result of an initial low O content due to its location on the disk of M33, known to present a steep metallicity gradient. In combination with the He abundance, the most plausible interpretation is that UIT005 is in an advanced stage of evolution, showing in its surface N enrichment and O depletion resulting from mixing with CNO processed material from the stellar interior. A comparison with the predictions of current stellar evolutionary models indicates that there are significant discrepancies, in particular with regard to the degree of chemical processing, with the models predicting a much lower degree of O depletion than observed. At the same time, the mass-loss rate derived in our analysis is an order of magnitude lower than the values considered in the evolutionary calculations. Based on a study of the surrounding stellar population and the nearby cluster NGC588, using WFPC2 photometry, we suggest that UIT005 could be in fact a runaway star from this cluster. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2950;Internal Motions in Starless Dense Cores; Chang Won Lee,  Philip C. Myers;  This paper discusses the statistics of internal motions in starless dense cores and the relation of these motions to core density and evolution. Four spectral lines from three molecular species are analyzed from single-pointing and mapped observations of several tens of starless cores. Blue asymmetric profiles are dominant, indicating that inward motions are prevalent in sufficiently dense starless cores. These blue profiles are found to be more abundant, and their asymmetry is bluer, at core positions with stronger $\rm N_2H^+$ line emission or higher column density. Thirty three starless cores are classified into four types according to the blue and red shifts of the lines in their molecular line maps. Among these cores, contracting motions dominate: 19 are classified as contracting, 3 as oscillating, 3 as expanding, and 8 as static. Contracting cores have inward motions all over the core with predominance of those motions near the region of peak density. Cores with the bluest asymmetry tend to have greater column density than other cores and all five cores with peak column density $> \rm 6\times 10^{21} cm^{-2}$ are found to be contracting. This suggests that starless cores are likely to have contracting motions if they are sufficiently condensed. Our classification of the starless cores may indicate a sequence of core evolution in the sense that column density increases from static to contracting cores: the static cores in the earliest stage, the expanding and/or the oscillating cores in the next, and the contracting cores in the latest stage. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

We present results of near-infrared (JHKs) polarization observations toward the filamentary cloud. Our polarization measurements of near-infrared point sources indicate a well-ordered global magnetic field that is perpendicular to the main filament, implying that the magnetic field is likely to have controlled the formation of the main filament. On the other hand, the sub-filaments, which converge on the central part of the cluster, tend to run along the magnetic field. The global magnetic field appears to be curved in the southern part of the main filament. Such morphology is consistent with the idea that the global magnetic field is distorted by gravitational contraction along the main filament toward the northern part that contains larger mass. Applying the Chandrasekhar-Fermi method, the magnetic field strength is roughly estimated to be a few x 100 microgauss, suggesting that the filamentary cloud is close to magnetically critical as a whole. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

We focus our attention primarily on members of young stellar associations of known ages. Specifically, we extend our previous analysis in Paper I (Messina et al. 2010, A&A 520, A15) to 3 additional young stellar associations beyond 100 pc and with ages in the range 6-40 Myr: epsilon Chamaeleontis (~6 Myr), Octans (~20 Myr), and Argus (~40 Myr). Additional rotational data of eta Chamaeleontis and IC2391 clusters are also considered. Rotational periods were determined from photometric time-series data obtained by the All Sky Automated Survey (ASAS) and the Wide Angle Search for Planets (SuperWASP) archives. With the present study we have completed the analysis of the rotational properties of the late-type members of all known young loose associations in the solar neighborhood. Considering also the results of Paper I, we have derived the rotation periods of 241 targets: 171 confirmed, 44 likely, 26 uncertain. The period of the remaining 50 stars known to be part of loose associations still remains unknown. This rotation period catalogue, and specifically the new information presented in this paper at ~6, 20, and 40 Myr, contributes significantly to a better observational description of the angular momentum evolution of young stars. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Kontar;  The hard X-ray (HXR) emission in solar flares comes almost exclusively from a very small part of the flaring region, the footpoints of magnetic loops. Using RHESSI observations of solar flare footpoints, we determine the radial positions and sizes of footpoints as a function of energy in six near-limb events to investigate the transport of flare accelerated electrons and the properties of the chromosphere. HXR visibility forward fitting allows to find the positions/heights and the sizes of HXR footpoints along and perpendicular to the magnetic field of the flaring loop at different energies in the HXR range. We show that in half of the analyzed events, a clear trend of decreasing height of the sources with energy is found. Assuming collisional thick-target transport, HXR sources are located between 600 and 1200 km above the photosphere for photon energies between 120 and 25 keV respectively. In the other events, the position as a function of energy is constant within the uncertainties. The vertical sizes (along the path of electron propagation) range from 1.3 to 8 arcseconds which is up to a factor 4 larger than predicted by the thick-target model even in events where the positions/heights of HXR sources are consistent with the collisional thick-target model. Magnetic mirroring, collisional pitch angle scattering and X-ray albedo are discussed as potential explanations of the findings. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

(2) SOFIA Science Center, NASA Ames Research Center (3) Department of Astronomy, The University of Minnesota, (4) American Astronomical Society);  Fast novae are primarily located within the plane of the Galaxy, slow novae are found within its bulge. Because of high interstellar extinction along the line of sight many novae lying close to the plane are missed and only the brightest seen. One nova lying very close to the Galactic plane is V1721 Aquilae, discovered in outburst on 2008 September 22. Spectra obtained 2.69 days after outburst revealed very high expansion velocities (FWHM ~6450 km/s). In this paper we have used available pre- and post-outburst photometry and post-outburst spectroscopy to conclude that the object is a very fast, luminous, and highly extinguished A_V=11.6+/-0.2) nova system with an average ejection velocity of ~3400 km/s. Pre-outburst near-IR colours from 2MASS indicate that at quiescence the object is similar to many quiescent CNe and appears to have a main sequence/sub-giant secondary rather than a giant. Based on the speed of decline of the nova and its emission line profiles we hypothesise that the axis ratio of the nova ejecta is ~1.4 and that its inclination is such that the central binary accretion disc is face-on to the observer. The accretion disc's blue contribution to the system's near-IR quiescent colours may be significant. Simple models of the nova ejecta have been constructed using the morphological modelling code XS5, and the results support the above hypothesis. Spectral classification of this object has been difficult owing to low S/N levels and high extinction, which has eliminated all evidence of any He/N or FeII emission within the spectra. We suggest two possibilities for the nature of V1721 Aql: that it is a U Sco type RN with a sub-giant secondary or, less likely, that it is a highly energetic bright and fast classical nova with a main sequence secondary. Future monitoring of the object for possible RN episodes may be worthwhile, as would archival searches for previous outbursts. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0008;Constraints on the Compact Object Mass in the Eclipsing HMXB XMMU  J013236.7+303228 in M33; Varun Bhalerao,  Marten H van Kerkwijk,  Fiona Harrison;  We present optical spectroscopic measurements of the eclipsing High Mass X-ray Binary XMMU J013236.7+303228 in M33. Based on spectra taken at multiple epochs of the 1.73d binary orbital period we determine physical as well as orbital parameters for the donor star. We find the donor to be a B1.5IV sub-giant with effective temperature T=22,000-23,000 K. From the luminosity, temperature and known distance to M33 we derive a radius of R = 8.9 \pm 0.5 R_sun. From the radial--velocity measurements, we determine a velocity semi-amplitude of K_opt = 63 \pm 12 km/sec. Using the physical properties of the B-star determined from the optical spectrum, we estimate the star's mass to be M_opt = 11 \pm 1 M_sun. Based on the X-ray spectrum, the compact companion is likely a neutron star, although no pulsations have yet been detected. Using the spectroscopically derived B-star mass we find the neutron star companion mass to be M_X = 2.0 \pm 0.4 M_sun, consistent with the neutron star mass in the HMXB Vela X-1, but heavier than the canonical value of 1.4 M_sun found for many millisecond pulsars. We attempt to use as an additional constraint that the B star radius inferred from temperature, flux, and distance, should equate the Roche radius, since the system accretes by Roche lobe overflow. This leads to substantially larger masses, but from trying to apply the technique to known systems, we find that the masses are consistently overestimated. Attempting to account for that in our uncertainties, we derive M_X = 2.2^{+0.8}_{-0.6} M_sun and M_opt =13 \pm 4 M_sun. We conclude that precise constraints require detailed modeling of the shape of the Roche surface. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)"

Kaiser;  A coronal mass ejection (CME) associated with a type II burst and originating close to the center of the solar disk typically results in a shock at Earth in 2-3 days and hence can be used to predict shock arrival at Earth. However, a significant fraction (about 28%) of such CMEs producing type II bursts were not associated with shocks at Earth. We examined a set of 21 type II bursts observed by the Wind/WAVES experiment at decameter-hectometric (DH) wavelengths that had CME sources very close to the disk center (within a central meridian distance of 30 degrees), but did not have a shock at Earth. We find that the near-Sun speeds of these CMEs average to ~644 km/s, only slightly higher than the average speed of CMEs associated with radio-quiet shocks. However, the fraction of halo CMEs is only ~30%, compared to 54% for the radio-quiet shocks and 91% for all radio-loud shocks. We conclude that the disk-center radio-loud CMEs with no shocks at 1 AU are generally of lower energy and they drive shocks only close to the Sun and dissipate before arriving at Earth. There is also evidence for other possible processes that lead to the lack of shock at 1 AU: (i) overtaking CME shocks merge and one observes a single shock at Earth, and (ii) deflection by nearby coronal holes can push the shocks away from the Sun-Earth line, such that Earth misses these shocks. The probability of observing a shock at 1 AU increases rapidly above 60% when the CME speed exceeds 1000 km/s and when the type II bursts propagate to frequencies below 1 MHz. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Motivated by these requirements, we conducted an extensive study on the activities of 118 solar-analog stars (of sufficiently similar properties to each other) by measuring the emission strength at the core of Ca II 3933.663 line (K line) on the high-dispersion spectrogram obtained by Subaru/HDS, where special attention was paid to correctly detecting the chromospheric emission by removing the wing-fitted photospheric profile calculated from the classical solar model atmosphere. This enabled us to detect low-level activities down to log R' ~ -5.4 (R' is the ratio of the chromospheric core emission flux to the total bolometric flux), by which we could detect subtle activity differences which were indiscernible in previous studies. Regarding the Sun, we found log R'sun = -5.33 near to the low end of the distribution, which means that it belongs to the distinctly low activity group among solar analogs. This excludes the once-suggested possibility for the high frequency of Maunder-minimum stars showing appreciably lower activities than the minimum-Sun. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0177;Detection of Gravitational Redshift on the Solar Disk by Using  Iodine-Cell Technique; Yoichi Takeda,  Satoru Ueno;"  With an aim to examine whether the predicted solar gravitational redshift can be observationally confirmed under the influence of the convective Doppler shift due to granular motions, we attempted measuring the absolute spectral line-shifts on a large number of points over the solar disk based on an extensive set of 5188-5212A region spectra taken through an iodine-cell with the Solar Domeless Telescope at Hida Observatory. The resulting heliocentric line shifts at the meridian line (where no rotational shift exists), which were derived by finding the best-fit parameterized model spectrum with the observed spectrum and corrected for the earth's motion, turned out to be weakly position-dependent as ~ +400 m/s near the disk center and increasing toward the limb up to ~ +600 m/s (both with a standard deviation of sigma ~ 100 m/s). Interestingly, this trend tends to disappear when the convectiveshift due to granular motions (~-300 m/s at the disk center and increasing toward the limb; simulated based on the two-component model along with the empirical center-to-limb variation) is subtracted, finally resulting in the averaged shift of 698 m/s (sigma = 113 m/s). Considering the ambiguities involved in the absolute wavelength calibration or in the correction due to convective Doppler shifts (at least several tens m/s, or more likely up to <~100 m/s), we may regard that this value is well consistent with the expected gravitational redshift of 633 m/s.

Dal;  In this paper, we present standard Johnson UBV photometry of the eclipsing binary BD+36 3317 which is known as a member of Delta Lyrae (Stephenson 1) cluster. We determined colors and brightness of the system, calculated E(B - V) color excess. We discovered that the system shows total eclipse in secondary minimum. Using this advantage, we found that the primary component of the system has B9 - A0 spectral type. Although there is no published orbital solution, we tried to estimate the physical properties of the system from simultaneous analysis of UBV light curves with 2003 version of Wilson-Devinney code. Then we considered photometric solution results together with evolutionary models and estimated the masses of the components as M1 = 2.5 Msun and M2 = 1.6 Msun. Those estimations gave the distance of the system as 353 pc. Considering the uncertainties in distance estimation, resulting distance is in agreement with the distance of Delta Lyrae cluster. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Lommen,  Baerbel Koribalski;  We present ATCA results of a 3 and 7 mm continuum survey of 20 T Tauri stars in the Chamaeleon and Lupus star forming regions. This survey aims to identify protoplanetary discs with signs of grain growth. We detected 90% of the sources at 3 and 7 mm, and determined the spectral slopes, dust opacity indices and dust disc masses. We also present temporal monitoring results of a small sub-set of sources at 7, 15 mm and 3+6 cm to investigate grain growth to cm sizes and constrain emission mechanisms in these sources. Additionally, we investigated the potential correlation between grain growth signatures in the infrared (10 \mu m silicate feature) and millimetre (1-3 mm spectral slope, {\alpha}). Eleven sources at 3 and 7 mm have dominant thermal dust emission up to 7 mm, with 7 of these having a 1-3 mm dust opacity index less than unity, suggesting grain growth up to at least mm sizes. The Chamaeleon sources observed at 15 mm and beyond show the presence of excess emission from an ionised wind and/or chromo- spheric emission. Long-timescale monitoring at 7 mm indicated that cm-sized pebbles are present in at least four sources. Short-timescale monitoring at 15 mm suggests the excess emission is from thermal free-free emission. Finally, a weak correlation was found between the strength of the 10 \mum feature and {\alpha}, suggesting simultaneous dust evolution of the inner and outer parts of the disc. This survey shows that grain growth up to cm-sized pebbles and the presence of excess emission at 15 mm and beyond are common in these systems, and that temporal monitoring is required to disentangle these emission mechanisms. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)"

Chen;  A northern subsample of 89 Spitzer GLIMPSE extended green objects (EGOs), the candidate massive young stellar objects, are surveyed for molecular lines in two 1-GHz ranges: 251.5- 252.5 and 260.188-261.188 GHz. A comprehensive catalog of observed molecular line data and spectral plots are presented. Eight molecular species are undoubtedly detected: H13CO+, SiO, SO, CH3OH, CH3OCH3, CH3CH2CN, HCOOCH3, and HN13C. H13CO+ 3-2 line is detected in 70 EGOs among which 37 ones also show SiO 6-5 line, demonstrating their association to dense gas and supporting the outflow interpretation of the extended 4.5 um excess emission. Our major dense gas and outflow tracers (H13CO+, SiO, SO and CH3OH) are combined with our previous survey of 13CO, 12CO and C18O 1-0 toward the same sample of EGOs for a multi-line multi- cloud analysis of line width and luminosity correlations. Good log-linear correlations are found among all considered line luminosities, which requires a universal similarity of density and thermal structures and probably of shock properties among all EGO clouds to explain. It also requires that the shocks should be produced within the natal clouds of the EGOs. Diverse degrees of correlation are found among the line widths. However, both the line width and luminosity correlations tend to progressively worsen across larger cloud subcomponent size-scales, depicting the increase of randomness across cloud subcomponent sizes. Moreover, the line width correlations among the three isotopic CO 1-0 lines show data scatter as linear functions of the line width itself, indicating that the velocity randomness also increases with whole-cloud sizes and has some regularity behind. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0308;Quantitative spectroscopy of Galactic BA-type supergiants. I.  Atmospheric parameters; M. Firnstein,  N. Przybilla;"  BA-type supergiants show a high potential as versatile indicators for modern astronomy. The focus here is on the determination of accurate and precise atmospheric parameters for a sample of 35 Galactic BA-type supergiants. Some first applications include a recalibration of functional relationships between spectral-type, intrinsic colours, bolometric corrections and effective temperature, and an exploration of the reddening-free Johnson Q and Str\""omgren [c_1] and beta-indices as photometric indicators for effective temperatures and gravities of BA-type supergiants. An extensive grid of theoretical spectra is computed based on a hybrid non-LTE approach. The atmospheric parameters are derived spectroscopically by line-profile fits to high-resolution and high-S/N spectra obtained at various observatories. Ionization equilibria of multiple metals and the Stark-broadened H and the neutral He lines constitute our primary indicators for the parameter determination, supplemented by (spectro-)photometry. Data on Teff, logg, helium abundances, microturbulence, macroturbulence and rotational velocities are presented. The interstellar reddening and the ratio of total-to-selective extinction towards the stars are determined. Our empirical spectral-type-Teff scale is steeper than reference relations, the stars are significantly bluer, and bolometric corrections differ significantly from established literature values. Photometric Teff-determinations based on the reddening-free Q-index are found to be of limited use for studies of BA-type supergiants because of large errors of typically +-5%+-3% (1sigma statistical, 1sigma systematic), compared to a spectroscopically achieved precision of 1-2%. The reddening-free [c_1]-index and beta on the other hand are found to provide useful starting values for further analyses, with uncertainties of +-1%+-2.5% in Teff, and +-0.04+-0.13dex in log g.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0372;Impact of rotation and disc lifetime on pre-main sequence lithium  depletion of solar-type stars; P. Eggenberger,  L. Haemmerlé,  G. Meynet,  A. Maeder;  Aims: We study the influence of rotation and disc lifetime on lithium depletion of pre-main sequence (PMS) solar-type stars. Methods: The impact of rotational mixing and of the hydrostatic effects of rotation on lithium abundances are investigated by computing non-rotating and rotating PMS models that include a comprehensive treatment of shellular rotation. The influence of the disc lifetime is then studied by comparing the lithium content of PMS rotating models experiencing different durations of the disc-locking phase between 3 and 9 Myr. Results: The surface lithium abundance at the end of the PMS is decreased when rotational effects are included. During the beginning of the lithium depletion phase, only hydrostatic effects of rotation are at work. This results in a decrease in the lithium depletion rate for rotating models compared to non-rotating ones. When the convective envelope recedes from the stellar centre, rotational mixing begins to play an important role due to differential rotation near the bottom of the convective envelope. This mixing results in a decrease in the surface lithium abundance with a limited contribution from hydrostatic effects of rotation, which favours lithium depletion during the second part of the PMS evolution. The impact of rotation on PMS lithium depletion is also found to be sensitive to the duration of the disc-locking phase. When the disc lifetime increases, the PMS lithium abundance of a solar-type star decreases owing to the higher efficiency of rotational mixing in the radiative zone. A relationship between the surface rotation and lithium abundance at the end of the PMS is then obtained: slow rotators on the zero-age main sequence are predicted to be more lithium-depleted than fast rotators due to the increase in the disc lifetime. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Such investigations were carried out in the limit of complete frequency redistribution (CRD) and neglecting quantum interference between the two upper J-levels of each line. Here we relax both approximations and show that the joint action of partial frequency redistribution (PRD) and J-state interference produces much more complex fractional linear polarization (Q/I) profiles, with large amplitudes in their wings. Such wing polarization signals turn out to be very sensitive to the temperature structure of the atmospheric model, so that they can be exploited for constraining the thermal properties of the solar chromosphere. Finally, we show that the approximation of CRD without J-state interference is however suitable for estimating the amplitude of the linear polarization signals in the core of the lines, where the Hanle effect operates. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Williams,  Massimo Della Valle,  Johny Setiawan;  We present optical and NIR spectroscopic observations of U Sco 2010 outburst. From the analysis of lines profiles we identify a broad and a narrow component and show that the latter originates from the reforming accretion disk. We show that the accretion resumes shortly after the outburst, on day +8, roughly when the super-soft (SSS) X-ray phase starts. Consequently U Sco SSS phase is fueled (in part or fully) by accretion and should not be used to estimate $m_{\mathrm{rem}}$, the mass of accreted material which has not been ejected during the outburst. In addition, most of the He emission lines, and the HeII lies in particular, form in the accretion flow/disk within the binary and are optically thick, thus preventing an accurate abundance determination. A late spectrum taken in quiescence and during eclipse shows CaII H&K, the G-band and MgI b absorption from the secondary star. However, no other significant secondary star features have been observed at longer wavelengths and in the NIR band. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

After reviewing the morphological evidence by recent observations, we perform a series of analytical calculations. We use realistic HII region parameters derived with the radiative transfer code Cloudy from observed stellar parameters. We are able to show that the current size, mass and pressure of the region can be explained in this scenario. We investigate the configuration today and come to the conclusion that the Pipe Nebula can be best described by a three phase medium in pressure equilibrium. The pressure support is provided by the ionized gas and mediated by an atomic component to confine the cores at the observed current pressure. In the future, star formation in these cores is likely to be either triggered by feedback of the most massive, gravitationally bound cores as soon as they collapse or by the supernova explosion of theta Ophiuchi itself. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Lambert,  C. Allende Prieto;"  We derive atmospheric parameters and lithium abundances for 671 stars and include our measurements in a literature compilation of 1381 dwarf and subgiant stars. First, a ""lithium desert"" in the effective temperature (Teff) versus lithium abundance (A_Li) plane is observed such that no stars with Teff~6075 K and A_Li~1.8 are found. We speculate that most of the stars on the low A_Li side of the desert have experienced a short-lived period of severe surface lithium destruction as main-sequence or subgiant stars. Next, we search for differences in the lithium content of thin-disk and thick-disk stars, but we find that internal processes have erased from the stellar photospheres their possibly different histories of lithium enrichment. Nevertheless, we note that the maximum lithium abundance of thick-disk stars is nearly constant from [Fe/H]=-1.0 to -0.1, at a value that is similar to that measured in very metal-poor halo stars (A_Li~2.2). Finally, differences in the lithium abundance distribution of known planet-host stars relative to otherwise ordinary stars appear when restricting the samples to narrow ranges of Teff or mass, but they are fully explained by age and metallicity biases. We confirm the lack of a connection between low lithium abundance and planets. However, we find that no low A_Li planet-hosts are found in the desert Teff window. Provided that subtle sample biases are not responsible for this observation, this suggests that the presence of gas giant planets inhibit the mechanism responsible for the lithium desert.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0518;Germanium, Arsenic, and Selenium Abundances in Metal-Poor Stars; Ian U. Roederer (Carnegie Observatories);  The elements germanium (Ge, Z=32), arsenic (As, Z=33), and selenium (Se, Z=34) span the transition from charged-particle or explosive synthesis of the iron-group elements to neutron-capture synthesis of heavier elements. Among these three elements, only the chemical evolution of germanium has been studied previously. Here we use archive observations made with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on board the Hubble Space Telescope and observations from several ground-based facilities to study the chemical enrichment histories of seven stars with metallicities -2.6 < [Fe/H] < -0.4. We perform a standard abundance analysis of germanium, arsenic, selenium, and several other elements produced by neutron-capture reactions. When combined with previous derivations of germanium abundances in metal-poor stars, our sample reveals an increase in the [Ge/Fe] ratios at higher metallicities. This could mark the onset of the weak s-process contribution to germanium. In contrast, the [As/Fe] and [Se/Fe] ratios remain roughly constant. These data do not directly indicate the origin of germanium, arsenic, and selenium at low metallicity, but they suggest that the weak and main components of the s-process are not likely sources. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)"

This periodicity is indicative of protostellar rotation at near-breakup speed. Modeling of the phased X-ray light curve indicates the high-temperature (~50 MK), X-ray-emitting plasma, which is most likely heated by accretion-induced magnetic reconnection, resides in dense (>~5e10 cm-3), pancake-shaped magnetic footprints where the accretion stream feeds the newborn star. The sustained X-ray periodicity of V1647 Ori demonstrates that such protostellar magnetospheric accretion configurations can be stable over timescales of years. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)"

Ibrahim;  The length of the asteroseismic timeseries obtained from the Kepler satellite analysed here span 19 months. Kepler provides the longest continuous timeseries currently available, which calls for a study of the influence of the increased timespan on the accuracy and precision of the obtained results. We find that in general a minimum of the order of 400 day long timeseries are necessary to obtain reliable results for the global oscillation parameters in more than 95% of the stars, but this does depend on <dnu>. In a statistical sense the quoted uncertainties seem to provide a reasonable indication of the precision of the obtained results in short (50-day) runs, they do however seem to be overestimated for results of longer runs. Furthermore, the different definitions of the global parameters used in the different methods have non-negligible effects on the obtained values. Additionally, we show that there is a correlation between nu_max and the flux variance. We conclude that longer timeseries improve the likelihood to detect oscillations with automated codes (from ~60% in 50 day runs to > 95% in 400 day runs with a slight method dependence) and the precision of the obtained global oscillation parameters. The trends suggest that the improvement will continue for even longer timeseries than the 600 days considered here, with a reduction in the median absolute deviation of more than a factor of 10 for an increase in timespan from 50 to 2000 days (the currently foreseen length of the mission). This work shows that global parameters determined with high precision - thus from long datasets - using different definitions can be used to identify the evolutionary state of the stars.

In this Letter we show that the non-dissipative entrainment coupling between the neutron superfluid and the nuclear lattice leads to a less mobile crust superfluid, effectively reducing the moment of inertia associated with the angular momentum reservoir. Combining the latest observational data for prolific glitching pulsars with theoretical results for the crust entrainment we find that the required superfluid reservoir exceeds that available in the crust. This challenges our understanding of the glitch phenomenon, and we discuss possible resolutions to the problem. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Korčáková;"  Context. 65 UMa belongs to rather small group of stellar systems of higher multiplicity, whose inner and outer orbits are well-known. Methods: Photometric, spectroscopic, and interferometric data were analyzed, revealing the basic physical properties of the system 65 UMa. A disentangling technique is used to perform the spectra decomposition. This combined approach allows us to study the long-term period changes in the system, identifying the period variation due to the motion on the visual orbit, in addition to a short-term modulation. Results: We find that the system contains one more component, hence 65 UMa is a sextuple hierarchical system. The most inner pair of components consists of an eclipsing binary orbiting around a barycenter on a circular orbit, both components being almost identical of spectral type about A7. This pair orbits on an eccentric orbit around a barycenter, and the third component orbits with a period of about 640 days. This motion is reflected in the period variation in the minima times of the eclipsing pair, as well as in the radial velocities of the primary, secondary, and tertiary components. Moreover, this system orbits around a barycenter with the distant component resolved interferometrically, whose period is of about 118 years. Two more distant components (4"" and 63"") are also probably gravitationally bound to the system. The nodal period of the eclipsing-pair orbit is on the order of only a few centuries, which makes this system even more interesting for a future prospective detection of changing the depths of minima. Conclusions: We identify a unique solution of the system 65 UMa, decomposing the individual components and even shifting the system to higher multiplicity. The study of this kind of multiple can help us to understand the origin of stellar systems. Besides 65 UMa, only another 11 sextuple systems have been studied.

Spectral energy distributions and evolutionary sequence; Benoit Commercon,  Ralf Launhardt,  Cornelis P. Dullemond,  Thomas Henning;  The low-mass star formation evolutionary sequence is relatively well-defined both from observations and theoretical considerations. The first hydrostatic core is the first protostellar equilibrium object that is formed during the star formation process. Using state-of-the-art radiation-magneto-hydrodynamic 3D adaptive mesh refinement calculations, we aim to provide predictions for the dust continuum emission from first hydrostatic cores. We investigate the collapse and the fragmentation of magnetized one solar mass prestellar dense cores and the formation and evolution of first hydrostatic cores using the RAMSES code. We use three different magnetization levels for the initial conditions, which cover a large variety of early evolutionary morphology, e.g., the formation of a disk or a pseudo-disk, outflow launching, and fragmentation. We post-process the dynamical calculations using the 3D radiative transfer code RADMC-3D. We compute spectral energy distributions and usual evolutionary stage indicators such as bolometric luminosity and temperature. We find that the first hydrostatic core lifetimes depend strongly on the initial magnetization level of the parent dense core. We derive, for the first time, spectral energy distribution evolutionary sequences from high-resolution radiation-magneto-hydrodynamic calculations. We show that under certain conditions, first hydrostatic cores can be identified from dust continuum emission at 24 microns and 70 microns. We also show that single spectral energy distributions cannot help to distinguish between the formation scenarios of the first hydrostatic core, i.e., between the magnetized and non-magnetized models. Spectral energy distributions are a first useful and direct way to target first hydrostatic core candidates but high-resolution interferometry is definitively needed to determine the evolutionary stage of the observed sources. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0692;Pervasive Linear Polarization Signals in the Quiet Sun; L. R. Bellot Rubio (IAA-CSIC),  D. Orozco Suárez (NAOJ);  This paper investigates the distribution of linear polarization signals in the quiet Sun internetwork using ultra-deep spectropolarimetric data. We reduce the noise of the observations as much as is feasible by adding single-slit measurements of the Zeeman-sensitive Fe I 630 nm lines taken by the Hinode spectropolarimeter. The integrated Stokes spectra are employed to determine the fraction of the field of view covered by linear polarization signals. We find that up to 69% of the quiet solar surface at disk center shows Stokes Q or U profiles with amplitudes larger than 0.032% (4.5 times the noise level of 7 x 10^{-5} reached by the longer integrations). The mere presence of linear polarization in most of the quiet Sun implies that the weak internetwork fields must be highly inclined, but we quantify this by inverting those pixels with Stokes Q or U signals well above the noise. This allows for a precise determination of the field inclination, field strength, and field azimuth because the information carried by all four Stokes spectra is used simultaneously. The inversion is performed for 53% of the observed field of view at a noise level of 1.3 x 10^{-4}. The derived magnetic distributions are thus representative of more than half of the quiet Sun internetwork. Our results confirm the conclusions drawn from previous analyses using mainly Stokes I and V: internetwork fields are very inclined, but except in azimuth they do not seem to be isotropically distributed. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0738;Experimental and theoretical study on the infrared spectroscopy of  astrophysically relevant PAH derivatives 2- and 9-vinylanthracene; Anju Maurya,  Shantanu Rastogi,  G. Rouillé,  Friedrich Huisken,  Thomas Henning;  We propose to evaluate the contribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules that carry side groups to the mid-infrared emission spectra. Within this framework, the IR absorption spectra of 2- and 9-vinylanthracene were measured in Ar matrices at 12 K and in CsI and polyethylene pellets at room temperature. The laboratory spectra were analyzed with the support of simulations based on the density functional theory. For each PAH molecule, eight IR spectra were computed by combining the B3LYP functional with as many different basis sets, namely 4-31G, 4-31G(d), 6-31G, 6-311G, 6-31G(d), 6-31G(d,p), 6-31+G(d,p), and 6-31++G(d,p). The comparison of the theoretical spectra with the laboratory data allowed us to determine the most suitable combinations for modeling the IR spectra of neutral PAH molecules that carry a vinyl side group. It was concluded from the examples of 2- and 9-VA that the optimum basis set is 6-31G unless a steric interaction has to be taken into account, in which case the optimum basis set is 6-31G(d). Thus, in the presence of such an interaction, the use of d-type polarization functions is recommended. We discuss the possibility for neutral vinyl-substituted PAHs to contribute to the mid-infrared emission spectra and find that their specific features do not match with the mid-infrared aromatic emission bands. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0774;Suzaku Observation of Strong Fluorescent Iron Line Emission from the  Young Stellar Object V1647 Ori during Its New X-ray Outburst; Kenji Hamaguchi,  Nicolas Grosso,  Joel H. Kastner,  David A. Weintraub,  Michael Richmond;  The Suzaku X-ray satellite observed the young stellar object V1647 Ori on 2008 October 8 during the new mass accretion outburst reported in August 2008. During the 87 ksec observation with a net exposure of 40 ks, V1647 Ori showed a high level of X-ray emission with a gradual decrease in flux by a factor of 5 and then displayed an abrupt flux increase by an order of magnitude. Such enhanced X-ray variability was also seen in XMM-Newton observations in 2004 and 2005 during the 2003-2005 outburst, but has rarely been observed for other young stellar objects. The spectrum clearly displays emission from Helium-like iron, which is a signature of hot plasma (kT ~5 keV). It also shows a fluorescent iron Kalpha line with a remarkably large equivalent width of ~600 eV. Such a large equivalent width suggests that a part of the incident X-ray emission that irradiates the circumstellar material and/or the stellar surface is hidden from our line of sight. XMM-Newton spectra during the 2003-2005 outburst did not show a strong fluorescent iron Kalpha line, so that the structure of the circumstellar gas very close to the stellar core that absorbs and re-emits X-ray emission from the central object may have changed in between 2005 and 2008. This phenomenon may be related to changes in the infrared morphology of McNeil's nebula between 2004 and 2008. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)"

About 250 high resolution spectra of the H$\alpha$ line were obtained by amateur covering the three years around eclipse. We visually inspect the dynamical spectrum constructed from the data and analyze the evolution with time of the radial velocity and of EW (Equivalent Width) vs V mag. The spectroscopic data reveal many details which confirm the complexity of the Aurigae system. The object is far from being understood. In particular, according to our measurements, the eclipse duration has been underestimated and key dates were defined. A complete analysis of details revealed by our data would require much time and effort. Observers are encouraged to continue monitoring the H$\alpha$ line out of eclipse in the hope that it will provide further important information. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0822;The influence of rotation on optical emission profiles of O stars; D. John Hillier,  Jean-Claude Bouret,  Thierry Lanz,  Joseph R. Busche;"  We study the formation of photospheric emission lines in O stars and show that the rectangular profiles, sometimes double peaked, that are observed for some stars are a direct consequence of rotation, and it is unnecessary to invoke an enhanced density structure in the equatorial regions. Emission lines, such as N IV 4058 and the N III 4634-4640-4642 multiplet, exhibit non-standard ""limb darkening"" laws. The lines can be in absorption for rays striking the center of the star and in emission for rays near the limb. Weak features in the flux spectrum do not necessarily indicate an intrinsically weak feature -- instead the feature can be weak because of cancellation between absorption in ""core"" rays and emission from rays near the limb. Rotation also modifies line profiles of wind diagnostics such as He II 4686 and Halpha and should not be neglected when inferring the actual stratification, level and nature of wind structures.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0881;Molecular environments of 51 Planck cold clumps in Orion complex; Tie Liu,  Yuefang Wu,  Huawei Zhang;  A mapping survey towards 51 Planck cold clumps projected on Orion complex was performed with J=1-0 lines of $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO at the 13.7 m telescope of Purple Mountain Observatory. The mean column densities of the Planck gas clumps range from 0.5 to 9.5$\times10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, with an average value of (2.9$\pm$1.9)$\times10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$. While the mean excitation temperatures of these clumps range from 7.4 to 21.1 K, with an average value of 12.1$\pm$3.0 K. The averaged three-dimensional velocity dispersion $\sigma_{3D}$ in these molecular clumps is 0.66$\pm$0.24 km s$^{-1}$. Most of the clumps have $\sigma_{NT}$ larger than or comparable with $\sigma_{Therm}$. The H$_{2}$ column density of the molecular clumps calculated from molecular lines correlates with the aperture flux at 857 GHz of the dust emission. Through analyzing the distributions of the physical parameters, we suggest turbulent flows can shape the clump structure and dominate their density distribution in large scale, but not affect in small scale due to the local fluctuations. Eighty two dense cores are identified in the molecular clumps. The dense cores have an averaged radius and LTE mass of 0.34$\pm$0.14 pc and 38$_{-30}^{+5}$ M$_{\sun}$, respectively. And structures of low column density cores are more affected by turbulence, while those of high column density cores are more concerned by other factors, especially by gravity. The correlation of the velocity dispersion versus core size is very weak for the dense cores. The dense cores are found most likely gravitationally bounded rather than pressure confined. The relationship between $M_{vir}$ and $M_{LTE}$ can be well fitted with a power law. The core mass function here is much more flatten than the stellar initial mass function. The lognormal behavior of the core mass distribution is most likely determined by the internal turbulence. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

G. de Wijn;  Since the discovery by Hale in the early 1900s that sunspots harbor strong magnetic field, magnetism has become increasingly important in our understanding of processes on the Sun and in the Heliosphere. Many current and planned instruments are capable of diagnosing magnetic field in the solar atmosphere. Photospheric magnetometry is now well-established. However, many challenges remain. For instance, the diagnosis of magnetic field in the chromosphere and corona is difficult, and interpretation of measurements is harder still. As a result only very few measurements have been made so far, yet it is clear that if we are to understand the outer solar atmosphere we must study the magnetic field. I will review the history of solar magnetic field measurements, describe and discuss the three types of magnetometry, and close with an outlook on the future. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.1023;Angular momentum transport in stellar interiors constrained by  rotational splittings of mixed modes in red giants; P. Eggenberger,  J. Montalbán,  A. Miglio;  Context: Recent asteroseismic observations have led to the determination of rotational frequency splittings for l=1 mixed modes in red giants. Aims: We investigate how these observed splittings can constrain the modelling of the physical processes transporting angular momentum in stellar interiors. Methods: We first compare models including a comprehensive treatment of shellular rotation only, with the rotational splittings observed for the red giant KIC 8366239. We then study how these asteroseismic constraints can give us information about the efficiency of an additional mechanism for the internal transport of angular momentum. This is done by computing rotating models of KIC 8366239 that include a constant viscosity corresponding to this physical process, in addition to the treatment of shellular rotation. Results: We find that models of red giant stars including shellular rotation only predict steep rotation profiles, which are incompatible with the measurements of rotational splittings in the red giant KIC 8366239. Meridional circulation and shear mixing alone are found to produce an insufficient internal coupling so that an additional mechanism for the internal transport of angular momentum is needed during the post-main sequence evolution. We show that the viscosity nu_add corresponding to this mechanism is strongly constrained to be nu_add=3x10^4 cm^2 s^-1 thanks to the observed ratio of the splittings for modes in the wings to those at the centre of the dipole forests. Such a value of viscosity may suggest that the same unknown physical process is at work during the main sequence and the post-main sequence evolution. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Huang;  The compression or expansion of a magnetic field that is initially potential is considered. It was recently suggested by Janse & Low [2009, ApJ, 690, 1089] that, following the volumetric deformation, the relevant lowest energy state for the magnetic field is another potential magnetic field that in general contains tangential discontinuities (current sheets). Here we examine this scenario directly using a numerical relaxation method that exactly preserves the topology of the magnetic field. It is found that of the magnetic fields discussed by Janse & Low, only those containing magnetic null points develop current singularities during an ideal relaxation, while the magnetic fields without null points relax toward smooth force-free equilibria with finite non-zero current. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)"

Bessell;  Stars form with gaseous and dusty circumstellar envelopes, which rapidly settle into disks that eventually give rise to planetary systems. Understanding the process by which these disks evolve is paramount in developing an accurate theory of planet formation that can account for the variety of planetary systems discovered so far. The formation of Earth-like planets through collisional accumulation of rocky objects within a disk has mainly been explored in theoretical and computational work in which post-collision ejecta evolution is typically ignored, although recent work has considered the fate of such material. Here we report observations of a young, Sun-like star (TYC 8241 2652 1) where infrared flux from post-collisional ejecta has decreased drastically, by a factor of about 30, over a period of less than two years. The star seems to have gone from hosting substantial quantities of dusty ejecta, in a region analogous to where the rocky planets orbit in the Solar System, to retaining at most a meagre amount of cooler dust. Such a phase of rapid ejecta evolution has not been previously predicted or observed, and no currently available physical model satisfactorily explains the observations. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)"

Frank;"  We investigate the properties of acoustic events (AEs), defined as spatially concentrated and short duration energy flux, in the quiet sun using observations of a 2D field of view (FOV) with high spatial and temporal resolution provided by the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) onboard \textit{Hinode}. Line profiles of Fe \textsc{i} 557.6 nm were recorded by the Narrow band Filter Imager (NFI) on a $82"" \times 82""$ FOV during 75 min with a time step of 28.75 s and 0.08$""$ pixel size. Vertical velocities were computed at three atmospheric levels (80, 130 and 180 km) using the bisector technique allowing the determination of energy flux in the range 3-10 mHz using two complementary methods (Hilbert transform and Fourier power spectra). Horizontal velocities were computed using local correlation tracking (LCT) of continuum intensities providing divergences. The net energy flux is upward. In the range 3-10 mHz, a full FOV space and time averaged flux of 2700 W m$^{-2}$ (lower layer 80-130 km) and 2000 W m$^{-2}$ (upper layer 130-180 km) is concentrated in less than 1% of the solar surface in the form of narrow (0.3$""$) AE. Their total duration (including rise and decay) is of the order of $10^{3}$ s. Inside each AE, the mean flux is $1.6 10^{5}$ W m$^{-2}$ (lower layer) and $1.2 10^{5}$ W m$^{-2}$ (upper). Each event carries an average energy (flux integrated over space and time) of $2.5 10^{19}$ J (lower layer) to $1.9 10^{19}$ J (upper). More than $10^{6}$ events could exist permanently on the Sun, with a birth and decay rate of 3500 s$^{-1}$.

We detect eclipses of the accretion disk by the mass donating secondary star every 3.74 hrs which is the binary orbital period. V447 Lyr is therefore the first dwarf nova in the Kepler field to show eclipses. We also detect five long outbursts and six short outbursts showing V447 Lyr is a U Gem type dwarf nova. We show that the orbital phase of the mid-eclipse occurs earlier during outbursts compared to quiescence and that the width of the eclipse is greater during outburst. This suggests that the bright spot is more prominent during quiescence and that the disk is larger during outburst than quiescence. This is consistent with an expansion of the outer disk radius due to the presence of high viscosity material associated with the outburst, followed by a contraction in quiescence due to the accretion of low angular momentum material. We note that the long outbursts appear to be triggered by a short outburst, which is also observed in the super-outbursts of SU UMa dwarf novae as observed using Kepler. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)"

Subramanian;  We report on the plasma properties of small-scale transient events identified in the quiet Sun, coronal holes and their boundaries. We use spectroscopic co-observations from SUMER/SoHO and EIS/Hinode combined with high cadence imaging data from XRT/Hinode. We measure Doppler shifts using single and multiple Gauss fits of transition region and coronal lines as well as electron densities and temperatures. We combine co-temporal imaging and spectroscopy to separate brightening expansions from plasma flows. The transient brightening events in coronal holes and their boundaries were found to be very dynamical producing high density outflows at large speeds. Most of these events represent X-ray jets from pre-existing or newly emerging coronal bright points at X-ray temperatures. The average electron density of the jets is logNe ~ 8.76 cm^-3 while in the flaring site it is logNe ~ 9.51 cm^-3. The jet temperatures reach a maximum of 2.5 MK but in the majority of the cases the temperatures do not exceed 1.6 MK. The footpoints of jets have temperatures of a maximum of 2.5 MK though in a single event scanned a minute after the flaring the measured temperature was 12 MK. The jets are produced by multiple microflaring in the transition region and corona. Chromospheric emission was only detected in their footpoints and was only associated with downflows. The Doppler shift measurements in the quiet Sun transient brightenings confirmed that these events do not produce jet-like phenomena. The plasma flows in these phenomena remain trapped in closed loops. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Building upon our extensive previous work, we present spectra for 12 of the faintest candidates from our deep multi-band imaging, plus seven random objects in the same fields, using MOIRCS on Subaru. We confirm seven new sources as young very low mass objects (VLMOs), with Teff of 2400-3100K and mid-M to early-L spectral types. These objects add to the growing census of VLMOs in NGC1333, now totaling 58. Three confirmed objects (one found in this study) have masses below 15 MJup, according to evolutionary models, thus are likely planemos. We estimate the total planemo population with 5-15 MJup in NGC1333 is <~8. The mass spectrum in this cluster is well approximated by dN/dM ~ M^-alpha, with a single value of alpha = 0.6+/-0.1 for M<0.6Msol, consistent with other nearby star forming regions, and requires alpha <~ 0.6 in the planemo domain. Our results in NGC1333, as well as findings in several other clusters by ourselves and others, confirm that the star formation process extends into the planetary-mass domain, at least down to 6 MJup. However, given that planemos are 20-50 times less numerous than stars, their contribution to the object number and mass budget in young clusters is negligible. Our findings disagree strongly with the recent claim from a microlensing study that free-floating planetary-mass objects are twice as common as stars - if the microlensing result is confirmed, those isolated Jupiter-mass objects must have a different origin from brown dwarfs and planemos observed in young clusters. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.1453;Externally Fed Accretion onto Protostars; Paul A. Dalba,  Steven W. Stahler;  The asymmetric molecular emission lines from dense cores reveal slow, inward motion in the clouds' outer regions. This motion is present both before and after the formation of a central star. Motivated by these observations, we revisit the classic problem of steady, spherical accretion of gas onto a gravitating point mass, but now include self-gravity of the gas and impose a finite, subsonic velocity as the outer boundary condition. We find that the accretion rate onto the protostar is lower than values obtained for isolated, collapsing clouds, by a factor that is the Mach number of the outer flow. Moreover, the region of infall surrounding the protostar spreads out more slowly, at a speed close to the subsonic, incoming velocity. Our calculation, while highly idealized, provides insight into two longstanding problems -- the surprisingly low accretion luminosities of even the most deeply embedded stellar sources, and the failure so far to detect spatially extended, supersonic infall within their parent dense cores. Indeed, the observed subsonic contraction in the outer regions of dense cores following star formation appears to rule out a purely hydrodynamic origin for these clouds. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.1508;A Disk-Wind Model for the Near-Infrared Excess Emission in Protostars; Alissa Bans,  Arieh Konigl;"  Protostellar systems, ranging from low-luminosity T Tauri and Herbig Ae stars to high-luminosity Herbig Be stars, exhibit a near-infrared (NIR) excess in their spectra that is dominated by a bump in the monochromatic luminosity with a peak near 3 microns. The bump can be approximated by a thermal emission component of temperature 1500 K that is of the order of the sublimation temperature of interstellar dust grains. In the currently popular ""puffed up rim"" scenario, the bump represents stellar radiation that propagates through the optically thin inner region of the surrounding accretion disk and is absorbed and reemitted by the dust that resides just beyond the dust sublimation radius, Rsub. However, this model cannot account for the strongest bumps measured in these sources, and it predicts a large secondary bounce in the interferometric visibility curve that is not observed. In this paper we present an alternative interpretation, which attributes the bump to reemission of stellar radiation by dust that is uplifted from the disk by a centrifugally driven wind. Winds of this type are a leading candidate for the origin of the strong outflows associated with protostars, and there is observational evidence for disk winds originating on scales ~Rsub. Using a newly constructed Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, we show that this model can account for the NIR excess emission even in bright Herbig Ae stars such as AB Auriga and MWC 275, and that it successfully reproduces the basic features of the visibilities measured in these protostars. We argue that a robust dusty outflow in these sources could be self-limiting to a relatively narrow launching region between Rsub and 2Rsub. Finally, we suggest that our model could also naturally account for the NIR and scattered-light variability exhibited by a source like MWC 275, which may be triggered by the uplifting of dust clouds from the disk.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.1554;EoS for massive neutron stars; Tetsuya Katayama,  Tsuyoshi Miyatsu,  Koichi Saito;  Using relativistic Hartree-Fock approximation, we investigate the properties of the neutron-star matter in detail. In the present calculation, we consider not only the tensor coupling of vector mesons to octet baryons and the form factors at interaction vertexes but also the internal (quark) structure change of baryons in dense matter. The relativistic Hartree-Fock calculations are performed in two ways: one is the calculation with the coupling constants determined by SU(6) (quark model) symmetry, the other is with the coupling constants based on SU(3) (flavor) symmetry. For the latter case, we use the latest Nijmegen (ESC08) model. Then, it is very remarkable that the particle composition of the core matter in SU(3) symmetry is completely different from that in SU(6) symmetry. In SU(6) symmetry, all octet baryons appear in the density region below $\sim 1.2$ fm$^{-3}$, while, in the ESC08 model, only the \Xi^- hyperon is produced. Furthermore, the medium modification of the internal baryon structure hardens the equation of state for the core matter. Taking all these effects into account, we can obtain the maximum neutron-star mass which is consistent with the recently observed mass, 1.97 \pm 0.04 M_\sun (PSR J1614-2230). We therefore conclude that the extension from SU(6) symmetry to SU(3) symmetry in the meson-baryon couplings and the internal baryon-structure variation in matter certainly enhance the mass of neutron star. Furthermore, the effects of the form factor at vertex and the Fock contribution including the tensor coupling due to the vector mesons are indispensable to describe the core matter. In particular, the Fock term is very vital in reproducing the preferable value of symmetry energy, a_4 (\simeq 30 - 40 MeV), in nuclear matter. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.1573;Detections of Diffuse Interstellar Bands in the SDSS Low-resolution  Spectra; Haibo Yuan,  Xiaowei Liu;  Diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) have been discovered for almost a century, but their nature remains one of the most challenging problems in astronomical spectroscopy. Most recent work to identify and investigate the properties and carriers of DIBs concentrates on high-resolution spectroscopy of selected sight-lines. In this paper, we report detections of DIBs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) low-resolution spectra of a large sample of Galactic stars. Using a template subtraction method, we have successfully identified the DIBs $\lambda$$\lambda$5780, 6283 in the SDSS spectra of a sample of about 2,000 stars and measured their strengths and radial velocities. The sample is by far the largest ever assembled. The targets span a large range of reddening, E(B-V) ~ 0.2 -- 1.0, and are distributed over a large sky area and involve a wide range of stellar parameters (effective temperature, surface gravity and metallicity), confirming that the carriers of DIBs are ubiquitous in the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM). The sample is used to investigate relations between strengths of DIBs and magnitudes of line-of-sight extinction, yielding results (i.e., EW(5780)= 0.61 x E(B-V) and EW(6283) = 1.26 x E(B-V)) consistent with previous studies. DIB features have also been detected in the commissioning spectra of the Guoshoujing Telescope (LAMOST) of resolving power similar to that of SDSS. Detections of DIBs towards hundreds of thousands of stars are expected from the on-going and up-coming large scale spectroscopic surveys such as RAVE, SDSS III and LAMOST, particularly from the LAMOST Digital Sky Survey of the Galactic Anti-center (DSS-GAC). Such a huge database will provide an unprecedented opportunity to study the demographical distribution and nature of DIBs as well as using DIBs to probe the distribution and properties of the ISM and the dust extinction. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)"

Lynch,  Russ A. Howard,  Yan Li;  We intend to provide a comprehensive answer to the question on whether all Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) have flux rope structure. To achieve this, we present a synthesis of the LASCO CME observations over the last sixteen years, assisted by 3D MHD simulations of the breakout model, EUV and coronagraphic observations from STEREO and SDO, and statistics from a revised LASCO CME database. We argue that the bright loop often seen as the CME leading edge is the result of pileup at the boundary of the erupting flux rope irrespective of whether a cavity or, more generally, a 3-part CME can be identified. Based on our previous work on white light shock detection and supported by the MHD simulations, we identify a new type of morphology, the `two-front' morphology. It consists of a faint front followed by diffuse emission and the bright loop-like CME leading edge. We show that the faint front is caused by density compression at a wave (or possibly shock) front driven by the CME. We also present high-detailed multi-wavelength EUV observations that clarify the relative positioning of the prominence at the bottom of a coronal cavity with clear flux rope structure. Finally, we visually check the full LASCO CME database for flux rope structures. In the process, we classify the events into two clear flux rope classes (`3-part', `Loop'), jets and outflows (no clear structure). We find that at least 40% of the observed CMEs have clear flux rope structures. We propose a new definition for flux rope CMEs (FR-CMEs) as a coherent magnetic, twist-carrying coronal structure with angular width of at least 40 deg and able to reach beyond 10 Rsun which erupts on a time scale of a few minutes to several hours. We conclude that flux ropes are a common occurrence in CMEs and pose a challenge for future studies to identify CMEs that are clearly not FR-CMEs. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.1603;A Decade of Coronagraphic and Spectroscopic Studies of CME-Driven Shocks; Angelos Vourlidas,  Alessandro Bemporad;  Shocks driven by Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are primary agents of space weather. They can accelerate particles to high energies and can compress the magnetosphere thus setting in motion geomagnetic storms. For many years, these shocks were studied only in-situ when they crossed over spacecraft or remotely through their radio emission spectra. Neither of these two methods provides information on the spatial structure of the shock nor on its relationship to its driver, the CME. In the last decade, we have been able to not only image shocks with coronagraphs but also measure their properties remotely through the use of spectroscopic and image analysis methods. Thanks to instrumentation on STEREO and SOHO we can now image shocks (and waves) from the low corona, through the inner heliosphere, to Earth. Here, we review the progress made in imaging and analyzing CME-driven shocks and show that joint coronagraphic and spectrscopic observations are our best means to understand shock physics close to the Sun. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

However, reproducing the 30 \mu m feature with homogeneous MgS grains would require much more sulfur relative to the solar abundance. Direct gas-phase condensation of MgS occurs at a low efficiency. Precipitation of MgS on SiC precursor grains provides a more efficient formation mechanism, such that the assumption of homogeneous MgS grains may not be correct. Using a Monte Carlo-based radiative transfer code, we aim to model the 30 \mu m feature of the extreme carbon star LL Peg with MgS dust particles. We find that for LL Peg this modeling is insensitive to the unknown MgS optical properties at \lambda < 10 \mu m. When MgS is allowed to be in thermal contact with amorphous carbon and SiC, the amount of MgS required to reproduce the strength of 30 \mu m feature agrees with the solar abundance of sulfur, thereby resolving the reported MgS mass problem. We conclude that MgS is a valid candidate to be the carrier of the 30 \mu m feature when it is part of a composite grain population that has optical properties representative of an ensemble of particle shapes. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.1664;Formalism for inclusion of measured reaction cross sections in stellar  rates including uncertainties and its application to neutron capture in the  s-process; T. Rauscher;  A general formalism to include experimental reaction cross sections into calculations of stellar rates is presented. It also allows to assess the maximally possible reduction of uncertainties in the stellar rates by experiments. As an example for the application of the procedure, stellar neutron capture reactivities from KADoNiS v0.3 are revised and the remaining uncertainties shown. Many of the uncertainties in the stellar rates are larger than those obtained experimentally. This has important consequences for s-process models and the interpretation of meteoritic data because it allows the rates of some reactions to vary within a larger range than previously assumed. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"

It is found that the hyperonic constituents in large-mass neutron stars can not be simply ruled out, while the recently measured mass of the millisecond pulsar J1614-2230 can constrain significantly the in-medium hyperon interactions. Moreover, effects of nuclear symmetry energy on hyperonization in neutron stars are also discussed. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.1695;Towards the reconstruction of the EUV irradiance for solar cycle 23; Margit Haberreiter;  We present preliminary reconstructions of the EUV from 26 to 34\,nm from February 1997 to May 2005, covering most of solar cycle 23. The reconstruction is based on synthetic EUV spectra calculated with the spectral synthesis code Solar Modeling in 3D (SolMod3D). These spectra are weighted by the relative area coverage of the coronal features as identified from EIT images. The calculations are based on one-dimensional atmospheric structures that represent a temporal and spatial mean of the chromosphere, transition region, and corona. The employed segmentation analysis considers coronal holes, the quiet corona, and active regions identified on the solar disk. The reconstructed EUV irradiance shows a good agreement with observations taken with the CELIAS/SEM instrument onboard SOHO. Further improvement of the reconstruction including more solar features as well as the off-limb detection of activity features will be addressed in the near future. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

We now identify 49 Ceti as a member of the 40 Myr old Argus Association and present a colliding comet model to explain the high CO concentrations seen at 49 Ceti and the 30 Myr old A-type star HD 21997. The model suggests that massive -- 400 Earth mass -- analogs of the Sun's Kuiper Belt are in orbit about some A-type stars, that these large masses are composed primarily of comet-like objects, and that these objects are rich in CO and perhaps also CO2. We identify additional early-type members of the Argus Association and the Tucana/Horologium and Columba Associations; some of these stars display excess mid-infrared emission as measured with the Widefield Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE).

Titov,  Roberto Lionello,  Jon A. Linker,  Haimin Wang;"  We study an active-region dextral filament which was composed of two branches separated in height by about 13 Mm. This ""double-decker"" configuration sustained for days before the upper branch erupted with a GOES-class M1.0 flare on 2010 August 7. Analyzing this evolution, we obtain the following main results. 1) During hours before the eruption, filament threads within the lower branch were observed to intermittently brighten up, lift upward, and then merge with the upper branch. The merging process contributed magnetic flux and current to the upper branch, resulting in its quasi-static ascent. 2) This transfer might serve as the key mechanism for the upper branch to lose equilibrium by reaching the limiting flux that can be stably held down by the overlying field or by reaching the threshold of the torus instability. 3) The erupting branch first straightened from a reverse S shape that followed the polarity inversion line and then writhed into a forward S shape. This shows a transfer of left-handed helicity in a sequence of writhe-twist-writhe. The fact that the initial writhe is converted into the twist of the flux rope excludes the helical kink instability as the trigger process of the eruption, but supports the occurrence of the instability in the main phase, which is indeed indicated by the very strong writhing motion. 4) A hard X-ray sigmoid, likely of coronal origin, formed in the gap between the two original filament branches in the impulsive phase of the associated flare. This supports a model of transient sigmoids forming in the vertical flare current sheet. 5) Left-handed magnetic helicity is inferred for both branches of the dextral filament. 6) Two types of force-free magnetic configurations are compatible with the data, a double flux rope equilibrium and a single flux rope situated above a loop arcade.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.1826;Modeling the physical and excitation conditions of the molecular  envelope of NGC 7027; M. Santander-García,  V. Bujarrabal,  J. Alcolea;"  The link between the shaping of bipolar planetary nebulae and the mass ejection activity of their central stars is still poorly understood. Appropriately characterizing the evolution of the shells ejected during the late stages of evolution is vital to gain insight into the mechanism of nebular shaping. Herschel/HIFI provides an invaluable tool by opening a new window from which to probe warm molecular gas (~50-1000 K). We present a radiative-transfer, spatio-kinematic modeling of the molecular envelope of the young planetary nebula NGC 7027 in high- and low-J 12CO and 13CO transitions observed by Herschel/HIFI and IRAM 30-m, and discuss the structure and dynamics of the molecular envelope. We have developed a code which, used along with the existing SHAPE software, implements spatio-kinematic modeling with accurate non-LTE calculations of line excitation and radiative transfer in molecular species. We have used this code to build a relatively simple ""russian doll"" model of the molecular envelope of NGC 7027. The model nebula consists of four nested, mildly bipolar shells plus a pair of high-velocity blobs. The innermost shell is the thinnest and shows a significant jump in physical conditions (temperature, density, abundance and velocity) with respect to the adjacent shell. This is a clear indication of a shock front in the system. Each of the high-velocity blobs is divided into two sections with different physical conditions. The presence of H2O in NGC 7027, a C-rich nebula, is likely due to photo-induced chemistry from the hot central star. The computed molecular mass of the nebula is 1.3 Msun, compatible with estimates from previous works. ";Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Brunthaler;"  We have measured the annual parallax and proper motion of NML Cyg from multiple epoch VLBA observations of the circulstellar H2O and SiO masers. The measured parallax of NML Cyg is 0.620+/-0.047 mas, corresponding to a distance of 1.61+/-0.12 kpc. The measured proper motion of NML Cyg is mu_x = -1.55+/-0.42 mas/yr eastward and mu_y= -4.59+/-0.41 mas/yr northward. Both Both the distance and proper motion are consistent with that of Cyg OB2, within their joint uncertainty, confirming their association. Taking into consideration molecular absorption signatures seen toward NML Cyg, we suggest that NML Cyg lies on the far side of the Cyg OB2 association. The stellar luminosity revised with our distance brings NML Cyg significantly below the empirical luminosity limit for a red supergiant. Using the VLA observation the radio photosphere and the SiO maser as a phase reference, we partially resolve the radio photosphere of NML Cyg at 43 GHz and find its diameter is about 44 mas, suggesting an optical stellar diameter of 22 mas, if the size of radio photosphere is 2 times the optical photosphere. Based on the position of circumstellar SiO masers relative to the radio photosphere, we estimate the absolute position of NML Cyg at epoch 2008.868 to be R.A. = 20h46m25.5382s +/- 0.0010s, Decl. = 40d06'59.379"" +/- 0.015"".

Myriads of faint low excitation emission lines together with the He I and He II Paschen {\alpha} chromospheric lines are recorded on eclipse spectra where regions of limb prominences are obtained with space-borne imagers. We analyzed a deep flash spectrum obtained by summing 80 individual spectra to evaluate the intensity modulations of the continuum. Intensity deficits are observed and measured at the prominences boundaries in both eclipse and SWAP images. The prominence cavities interpreted as a relative depression of plasma density, produced inside the corona surrounding the prominences, and some intense heating occurring in these regions, are discussed. Photometric measurements are shown at different scales and different, spectrally narrow, intervals for both the prominences and the coronal background. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Johnson,  Catherine A. Pilachowski;"  We present O, Na, and Fe abundances, as well as radial velocities, for 113 red giant branch (RGB) and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars in the globular cluster M13. The abundances and velocities are based on spectra obtained with the WIYN-Hydra spectrograph, and the observations range in luminosity from the horizontal branch (HB) to RGB-tip. The results are examined in the context of recent globular cluster formation scenarios. We find that M13 exhibits many key characteristics that suggest its formation and chemical enrichment are well-described by current models. Some of these observations include: the central concentration of O-poor stars, the notable decrease in [O/Fe] (but small increase in [Na/Fe]) with increasing luminosity that affects primarily the ""extreme"" population, the small fraction of stars with halo-like composition, and the paucity of O-poor AGB stars. In agreement with recent work, we conclude that the most O-poor M13 giants are likely He-enriched and that most (all?) O-poor RGB stars evolve to become extreme HB and AGB-manqu\'e stars. In contrast, the ""primordial"" and ""intermediate"" population stars appear to experience standard HB and AGB evolution.

Parker;  We present new, accurate positions, spectral classifications, radial and rotational velocities, H-alpha fluxes, equivalent widths and B,V,I,R magnitudes for 579 hot emission-line stars (classes B0 - F9) in the Large Magellanic Cloud which include 469 new discoveries. Candidate emission line stars were discovered using a deep, high resolution H-alpha map of the central 25 deg2 of the LMC obtained by median stacking a dozen 2 hour H-alpha exposures taken with the UK Schmidt Telescope. Spectroscopic follow-up observations on the AAT, UKST, VLT, the SAAO 1.9m and the MSSSO 2.3m telescope have established the identity of these faint sources down to magnitude R~23 for H-alpha (4.5 x 10^-17 ergs cm^2 s^-1 Ang). Confirmed emission-line stars have been assigned an underlying spectral classification through cross-correlation against 131 absorption line template spectra covering the range O1 to F8. We confirm 111 previously identified emission line stars and 64 previously known variable stars with spectral types hotter than F8. The majority of hot stars identified (518 stars or 89%) are class B. Of all the hot emission-line stars in classes B-F, 130 or 22% are type B[e], characterised by the presence of forbidden emission lines such as [SII], [NII] and [OII]. We report on the physical location of these stars with reference to possible contamination from ambient HII emission. Along with flux calibration of the H-alpha emission we provide the first H-alpha luminosity function for selected sub-samples after correction for any possible nebula or ambient contamination. We find a moderate correlation between the intensity of H-alpha emission and the V magnitude of the central star based on SuperCOSMOS magnitudes and OGLE-II photometry where possible. Cool stars from classes G-S, with and without strong H-alpha emission, will be the focus of part 2 in this series. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

The EVE spectral range contains emission lines formed between 10^4-10^7 K, including transitions from highly ionized iron (>10 MK). Using three density-sensitive Fe XXI ratios, peak electron densities of 10^(11.2)-10^(12.1) cm^(-3) were found during four X-class flares. While previous measurements of densities at such high temperatures were made at only one point during a flaring event, EVE now allows the temporal evolution of these high-temperature densities to be determined at 10 s cadence. A comparison with GOES data revealed that the peak of the density time profiles for each line ratio correlated well with that of the emission measure time profile for each of the events studied. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.2005;Estimation of solar prominence magnetic fields based on the  reconstructed 3D trajectories of prominence knots; Maciej Zapiór,  Paweł Rudawy;  We present an estimation of the lower limits of local magnetic fields in quiescent, activated, and active (surges) promineces, based on reconstructed 3-dimensional (3D) trajectories of individual prominence knots. The 3D trajectories, velocities, tangential and centripetal accelerations of the knots were reconstructed using observational data collected with a single ground-based telescope equipped with a Multi-channel Subtractive Double Pass imaging spectrograph. Lower limits of magnetic fields channeling observed plasma flows were estimated under assumption of the equipartition principle. Assuming approximate electron densities of the plasma n_e = 5*10^{11} cm^{-3} in surges and n_e = 5*10^{10} cm^{-3} in quiescent/activated prominences, we found that the magnetic fields channeling two observed surges range from 16 to 40 Gauss, while in quiescent and activated prominences they were less than 10 Gauss. Our results are consistent with previous detections of weak local magnetic fields in the solar prominences. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.2020;The wings of Ca II H and K as photospheric diagnostics and the  reliability of one-dimensional photosphere modeling; V. A. Sheminova;  The extended wings of the Ca II H and K lines provide excellent diagnostics of the temperature stratification of the photosphere of the Sun and of other cool stars, thanks to their LTE opacities and source functions and their large span in formation height. The aim of this study is to calibrate the usage of the H and K wings in one-dimensional interpretation of spatially averaged spectra and in deriving per-pixel stratifications from resolved spectra. I use multi-dimensional simulations of solar convection to synthesize the H and K wings, derive one-dimensional models from these wings as if they were observed, and compare the resulting models to the actual simulation input. I find that spatially-averaged models constructed from the synthesized wings generally match the simulation averages well, except for the deepest layers of the photosphere where large thermal inhomogeneities and Planck-function nonlinearity gives large errors. The larger the inhomogeneity, the larger the latter. The presence of strong network fields increases such inhomogeneity. For quiet photospheric conditions the temperature excesses reach about 200 K. One-dimensional stratification fits of discrete structures such as granulation and small-scale magnetic concentrations give satisfactory results with errors that are primarily due to steep temperature gradients and abrupt changes of temperature with depth. I conclude that stratification modeling using the H and K wings is a useful technique for the interpretation of solar high-resolution observations. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Bachiller;"  Studying the appearance and properties of bipolar winds is critical to understand the stellar evolution from the AGB to the planetary nebula (PN) phase. Many uncertainties exist regarding the presence and role of binary stellar systems, mainly due to the deficit of conclusive observational evidences. We investigate the extended equatorial distribution around the early bipolar planetary nebula M 2-9 (""Minkowski's Butterfly Nebula"") to gather new information on the mechanism of the axial ejections. Interferometric millimeter observations of molecular emission provide the most comprehensive view of the equatorial mass distribution and kinematics in early PNe. Here we present subarcsecond angular-resolution observations of the 12CO J=2-1 line and continuum emission with the Plateau de Bure interferometer. The data reveal two ring-shaped and eccentric structures at the equatorial basis of the two coaxial optical lobes. The two rings were formed during short mass-loss episodes (~ 40 yr), separated by ~ 500 yr. Their positional and dynamical imprints provide evidence of the presence of a binary stellar system at the center, which yields critical information on its orbital characteristics, including a mass estimate for the secondary of ~< 0.2 \ms. The presence of a stellar system with a modest-mass companion at the center of such an elongated bipolar PN strongly supports the binary-based models, because these are more easily able to explain the frequent axisymmetric ejections in PNe.

The process of giant planet formation is terminated by the dissipation of gas in the protoplanetary disk. The gas-rich disk around HD142527 features a small inner disk, a large gap from \sim10 to \sim140AU, and a massive outer disk extending out to \sim300AU. The gap could have been carved-out by a giant planet. We have imaged the outer regions of this gap using the adaptive-optics camera NICI on Gemini South. Our images reveal that the disk is dynamically perturbed. The outer boundary of the roughly elliptical gap appears to be composed of several segments of spiral arms. The stellar position is offset by 0.17+-0.02"" from the centroid of the cavity, consistent with earlier imaging at coarser resolutions. These transient morphological features are expected in the context of disk evolution in the presence of a perturbing body located inside the cavity. We perform hydro-dynamical simulations of the dynamical clearing of a gap in a disk. A 10Mjup body in a circular orbit at r = 90AU, perturbs the whole disks, even after thousands of orbits. By then the model disk has an eccentric and irregular cavity, flanked by tightly wound spiral arms, but it is still evolving far from steady state. A particular transient configuration that is a qualitative match to HD142527 is seen at 1.7Myr. ";Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.2077;Asymmetric Solar Polar Field Reversals; Leif Svalgaard,  Yohsuke Kamide;  The solar polar fields reverse because magnetic flux from decaying sunspots moves towards the poles, with a preponderance of flux from the trailing spots. Let us assume that there is a strong asymmetry in the sense that all activity is in the Northern Hemisphere, then that excess flux will move to the North Pole and reverse that pole, while nothing happens in the South. If later on, there is a lot of activity in the South, then that flux will help reverse the South Pole. In this way, we get two humps in solar activity and a corresponding difference in time of reversals. Such difference was first noted by Babcock (1959) from the very first observation of polar field reversal just after the maximum of the strongly asymmetric solar cycle 19. At that time, the Southern Hemisphere was most active before sunspot maximum and the South Pole duly reversed first, followed by the Northern Hemisphere more than a year later, when that hemisphere was most active. Solar cycles since then have had the opposite asymmetry, with the Northern Hemisphere being most active early in the cycle. Polar field reversals for these cycles have as expected happened first in the North. This is especially noteworthy for the present solar cycle 24. We suggest that the association of two peaks of solar activity when separated by hemispheres with correspondingly different times of polar field reversals is a general feature of the cycle. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

We shortly review the topic and show that rather long term variations, corresponding to a length well over a a solar magnetic cycle, are interesting to consider. The very recently launched mission ""Picard"" is entirely devoted to the topic but will just permit a short term evaluation. At the time of the last total solar eclipse of 11/07/2010, several experiments were prepared to precisely measure the transit time of the Moon related to the precise value of the solar diameter. Preliminary results coming from the use of a specially designed CNES photometer, put on different atolls of the French Polynesia, are presented. In addition the results of new experiments devoted to fast observations of flash spectra, including their precise chronodating, are illustrated and discussed. A new definition of the edge of the Sun, free of spurious scattered light effects strongly affecting all out of eclipse observations, is emerging from these observations, in agreement with the most advanced attempts of modelling the outer layers of the photosphere. We also argue for a definite answer concerning the solar diameter measurement from eclipses based on a better precision of lunar profiles coming from lunar altimetry space experiments which will be possible in the following decades.

Moskalik;  We present the hydrodynamic BL Herculis-type models which display a long-term modulation of pulsation amplitudes and phases. The modulation is either strictly periodic or it is quasi-periodic, with the modulation period and modulation pattern varying from one cycle to the other. Such behaviour has not been observed in any BL Her variable so far, however, it is a common property of their lower luminosity siblings - RR Lyrae variables showing the Blazhko effect. These models provide a support for the recent mechanism proposed by Buchler & Kollath to explain this still mysterious phenomenon. In their model, a half-integer resonance that causes the period doubling effect, discovered recently in the Blazhko RR Lyrae stars, is responsible for the modulation of the pulsation as well. Although our models are more luminous than is appropriate for RR Lyrae stars, they clearly demonstrate, through direct hydrodynamic computation, that the mechanism can indeed be operational. Of great importance are models which show quasi-periodic modulation - a phenomenon observed in Blazhko RR Lyrae stars. Our models coupled with the analysis of the amplitude equations show that such behaviour may be caused by the dynamical evolution occurring in the close proximity of the unstable single periodic saddle point. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

We consider both the magnitude of the open flux that influences angular momentum loss in the stellar wind and X-ray emission measure. We use reconstructed maps of the radial magnetic field at the stellar surface and the potential-field source surface method to extrapolate a 3D coronal magnetic field for a sample of early-to-mid M dwarfs. During the magnetic reconstruction process it is possible to force a solution towards field geometries that are symmetric or antisymmetric about the equator but we demonstrate that this has only a modest impact on the coronal tracers mentioned above. We find that the dipole component of the field, which governs the large-scale structure, becomes increasingly strong as the stellar mass decreases, while the magnitude of the open (wind-bearing) magnetic flux is proportional to the magnitude of the reconstructed magnetic flux. By assuming a hydrostatic and isothermal corona we calculate X-ray emission measures (in magnitude and rotational modulation) for each star and, using observed stellar densities as a constraint, we reproduce the observed X-ray saturation at Ro < 0.1. We find that X-ray rotational modulation is not a good indicator of magnetic structure as it shows no trend with Rossby number but can be useful in discriminating between different assumptions on the field geometry. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.2184;Core-collapse supernova equations of state based on neutron star  observations; Andrew W. Steiner,  Matthias Hempel,  Tobias Fischer;  Many of the currently available equations of state for core-collapse supernova simulations give large neutron star radii and do not provide large enough neutron star masses, both of which are inconsistent with some recent neutron star observations. In addition, one of the critical uncertainties in the nucleon-nucleon interaction, the nuclear symmetry energy, is not fully explored by the currently available equations of state. In this article, we construct two new equations of state which match recent neutron star observations and provide more flexibility in studying the dependence on nuclear matter properties. The equations of state are also provided in tabular form, covering a wide range in density, temperature and asymmetry, suitable for astrophysical simulations. These new equations of state are implemented into our spherically symmetric core-collapse supernova model, which is based on general relativistic radiation hydrodynamics with three-flavor Boltzmann neutrino transport. The results are compared with commonly used equations of state in supernova simulations of 15 and 40 solar mass progenitors. We do not find any simple correlations between individual nuclear matter properties at saturation and the outcome of these simulations. However, the new equations of state lead to the most compact neutron stars among the relativistic mean-field models which we considered. The new models also obey the previously observed correlation between the time to black hole formation and the maximum mass of an s=4 neutron star. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)"

We present a mass distribution of WDs exploding as SNe Ia, where the WD mass ranges from 1.38 to 2.3 Msun. These progenitor models are assigned to various types of SNe Ia. A lower mass range of WDs (1.38 Msun < M_WD <~ 1.5 Msun), which are supported by rigid rotation, correspond to normal SNe Ia. A variety of spin-down time may lead to a variation of brightness. A higher mass range of WDs (M_WD >~ 1.5 Msun), which are supported by differential rotation, correspond to brighter SNe Ia such as SN 1991T. In this case, a variety of the WD mass may lead to a variation of brightness. We also show the evolutionary states of the companion stars at SN Ia explosions and pose constraints on the unseen companions. In the WD+RG systems, in particular, most of the RG companions have evolved to helium/carbon-oxygen WDs in the spin-down phase before the SN Ia explosions. In such a case, we do not expect any prominent signature of the companion immediately before and after the explosion. We also compare our new models with the recent stringent constraints on the unseen progenitors of SNe Ia such as SN 2011fe. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.2342;Three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of M-dwarf  chromospheres; S. Wedemeyer,  H.-G. Ludwig,  O. Steiner;"  We present first results from three-dimensional radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations of M-type dwarf stars with CO5BOLD. The local models include the top of the convection zone, the photosphere, and the chromosphere. The results are illustrated for models with an effective temperature of 3240 K and a gravitational acceleration of log g = 4.5, which represent analogues of AD Leo. The models have different initial magnetic field strengths and field topologies. This first generation of models demonstrates that the atmospheres of M-dwarfs are highly dynamic and intermittent. Magnetic fields and propagating shock waves produce a complicated fine-structure, which is clearly visible in synthetic intensity maps in the core of the Ca II K spectral line and also at millimeter wavelengths. The dynamic small-scale pattern cannot be described by means of one-dimensional models, which has important implications for the construction of semi-empirical model atmospheres and thus for the interpretation of observations in general. Detailed three-dimensional numerical simulations are valuable in this respect. Furthermore, such models facilitate the analysis of small-scale processes, which cannot be observed on stars but nevertheless might be essential for understanding M-dwarf atmospheres and their activity. An example are so-called ""magnetic tornadoes"", which have recently been found on the Sun and are presented here in M-dwarf models for the first time. ";Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.2350;The Salpeter Slope of the IMF Explained; M. S. Oey;  If we accept a paradigm that star formation is a self-similar, hierarchical process, then the Salpeter slope of the IMF for high-mass stars can be simply and elegantly explained as follows. If the instrinsic IMF at the smallest scales follows a simple -2 power-law slope, then the steepening to the -2.35 Salpeter value results when the most massive stars cannot form in the lowest-mass clumps of a cluster. It is stressed that this steepening MUST occur if clusters form hierarchically from clumps, and the lowest-mass clumps can form stars. This model is consistent with a variety of observations as well as theoretical simulations. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.2432;A Study of the Orbital Periods of Deeply Eclipsing SW Sextantis Stars; David Boyd;  Results are presented of a five-year project to study the orbital periods of eighteen deeply eclipsing novalike cataclysmic variables, collectively known as SW Sextantis stars, by combining new measurements of eclipse times with published measurements stretching back in some cases over fifty years. While the behaviour of many of these binary systems is consistent with a constant orbital period, it is evident that in several cases this is not true. Although the time span of these observations is relatively short, evidence is emerging that the orbital periods of some of these stars show cyclical variation with periods in the range 10-40 years. The two stars with the longest orbital periods, V363 Aur and BT Mon, also show secular period reduction with rates of -6.6 \times 10^{-8} days/year and -3.3 \times 10^{-8} days/year. New ephemerides are provided for all eighteen stars to facilitate observation of future eclipses. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

The NLTE model is applied to the analysis of Sr I and Sr II lines in the spectra of the Sun, Procyon, Arcturus, and HD 122563, showing a significant improvement in the ionization balance compared to LTE line formation calculations, which predict abundance discrepancies of up to 0.5 dex. The solar Sr abundance is log A = 2.93 \pm 0.04 dex, in agreement with the meteorites.

The calculations are performed for an extensive grid of 1D MARCS models of metal-rich and metal-poor late-type dwarfs and giants. We find that iron abundances derived from FeI lines are increasingly underestimated in hotter, lower surface-gravity, and more metal-poor stars, in a simple and well-defined pattern, while LTE is usually a realistic approximation for FeII lines. For the vast majority of dwarfs and giants, the perturbed ionisation balance of FeI and FeII is the main relevant NLTE effect to consider in the determination of spectroscopic parameters, while for extremely metal-poor stars and hot giant stars significant impact is seen also on the excitation balance and on the microturbulence determination from FeI lines. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

A new model of Fe atom was constructed from the most up-to-date theoretical and experimental atomic data available so far. Non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) line formation calculations for Fe were performed using 1D hydrostatic MARCS and MAFAGS-OS model atmospheres, as well as the spatial and temporal average stratifications from full 3D hydrodynamical simulations of stellar convection computed using the Stagger code. It is shown that the Fe I/Fe II ionization balance can be well established with the 1D and mean 3D models under NLTE including calibrated inelastic collisions with H I calculated from the Drawin's (1969) formulae. Strong low-excitation Fe I lines are very sensitive to the atmospheric structure; classical 1D models fail to provide consistent excitation balance, particularly so for cool metal-poor stars. A better agreement between Fe I lines spanning a range of excitation potentials is obtained with the mean 3D models. Mean NLTE metallicities determined for the standard stars using the 1D and mean 3D models are fully consistent. Also, the NLTE spectroscopic effective temperatures and gravities from ionization balance agree with that determined by other methods, e.g., infrared flux method and parallaxes, if one of the stellar parameters is constrained independently.

Thomas Megeath,  John J. Tobin,  Amelia M. Stutz,  Babar Ali,  Ian Remming,  Marina Kounkel,  Thomas Stanke,  Mayra Osorio,  Thomas Henning,  P. Manoj,  T. L. Wilson;  Individual outbursting young stars are important laboratories for studying the physics of episodic accretion and the extent to which this phenomenon can explain the luminosity distribution of protostars. We present new and archival data for V2775 Ori (HOPS 223), a protostar in the L 1641 region of the Orion molecular clouds that was discovered by Caratti o Garatti et al. (2011) to have recently undergone an order-of-magnitude increase in luminosity. Our near-infrared spectra of the source have strong blueshifted He I 10830 absorption, strong H2O and CO absorption, and no H I emission, all typical of FU Orionis sources. With data from IRTF, 2MASS, HST, Spitzer, WISE, Herschel, and APEX that span from 1 to 70 microns pre-outburst and from 1 to 870 microns post-outburst, we estimate that the outburst began between 2005 April and 2007 March. We also model the pre- and post-outburst spectral energy distributions of the source, finding it to be in the late stages of accreting its envelope with a disk-to-star accretion rate that increased from about 2x10^-6 M_sun/yr to about 10^-5 M_sun/yr during the outburst. The post-outburst luminosity at the epoch of the FU Orionis-like near-IR spectra is 28 L_sun, making V2775 Ori the least luminous documented FU Orionis outburster with a protostellar envelope. The existence of low-luminosity outbursts supports the notion that a range of episiodic accretion phenomena can partially explain the observed spread in protostellar luminosities. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)"

Dugué,  F. Massi,  J.-L. Monin,  M. Vannier;  Aims: We investigate the structure of the circumstellar disk of the T Tauri star S CrA N and test whether the observations agree with the standard picture proposed for Herbig Ae stars. Methods: Our observations were carried out with the VLTI/AMBER instrument in the H and K bands with the low spectral resolution mode. For the interpretation of our near-infrared AMBER and archival mid-infrared MIDI visibilities, we employed both geometric and temperature-gradient models. Results: To characterize the disk size, we first fitted geometric models consisting of a stellar point source, a ring-shaped disk, and a halo structure to the visibilities. In the H and K bands, we measured ring-fit radii of 0.73 +- 0.03 mas (corresponding to 0.095 +- 0.018 AU for a distance of 130 pc) and 0.85 +- 0.07 mas (0.111 +- 0.026 AU), respectively. This K-band radius is approximately two times larger than the dust sublimation radius of ~0.05 AU expected for a dust sublimation temperature of 1500 K and gray dust opacities, but approximately agrees with the prediction of models including backwarming (namely a radius of ~0.12 AU). The derived temperature-gradient models suggest that the disk is approximately face-on consisting of two disk components with a gap between star and disk. The inner disk component has a temperature close to the dust sublimation temperature and a quite narrow intensity distribution with a radial extension from 0.11 AU to 0.14 AU. Conclusions: Both our geometric and temperature-gradient models suggest that the T Tauri star S CrA N is surrounded by a circumstellar disk that is truncated at an inner radius of ~0.11 AU. The narrow extension of the inner temperature-gradient disk component implies that there is a hot inner rim. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.2469;Small-N Collisional Dynamics: Pushing Into the Realm of Not-So-Small-N; Nathan Leigh,  Aaron Geller;  In this paper, we study small-N gravitational dynamics involving up to six objects. We perform a large suite of numerical scattering experiments involving single, binary, and triple stars. This is done using the FEWBODY numerical scattering code, which we have upgraded to treat encounters involving triple stars. We focus on outcomes that result in direct physical collisions between stars, within the low angular momentum and high absolute orbital energy regime. The dependence of the collision probability on the number of objects involved in the interaction, N, is found for fixed total energy and angular momentum. Our results are consistent with a collision probability that increases approximately as N^2. Interestingly, this is also what is expected from the mean free path approximation in the limit of very large N. A more thorough exploration of parameter space will be required in future studies to fully explore this potentially intriguing connection. This study is meant as a first step in an on-going effort to extend our understanding of small-N collisional dynamics beyond the three- and four-body problems and into the realm of larger-N. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Classical Physics (physics.class-ph)"

An extensive I-band photometric data set of CHS7797 was compiled between 2004-2010 using various telescopes. Further optical data have been collected in R and z' bands. In addition, simultaneous observations of the ONC region including CHS7797 were performed in the I, J, Ks and IRAC [3.6] and [4.5] bands over a time interval of about 40d. CHS7797 shows an unusual large-amplitude variation of about 1.7 mag in the R, I, and z' bands with a period 17.786. The amplitude of the brightness modulation decreases only slightly at longer wavelengths. The star is faint during 2/3 of the period and the shape of the phased light-curves for seven different observing seasons shows minor changes and small-amplitude variations. Interestingly, there are no significant colour-flux correlations for wavelengths smaller than 2microns, while the object becomes redder when fainter at longer wavelengths. CHS7797 has a spectral type of M6 and an estimated mass between 0.04-0.1Msun. The analysis of the data suggests that the periodic variability of CHS7797 is most probably caused by an orbital motion. Variability as a result of rotational brightness modulation by spots is excluded by the lack of any color-brightness correlation in the optical. The latter indicates that CHS7797 is most probably occulted by circumstellar matter in which grains have grown from typical 0.1 microns to 1-2 micron sizes. We discuss two possible scenarios in which CHS7797 is periodically eclipsed by structures in a disc, namely that CHS7797 is a single object with a circumstellar disc, or that CHS7797 is a binary system, similar to KH15D, in which an inclined circumbinary disc is responsible of the variability. Possible reasons for the typical 0.3mag variations in I-band at a given phase are discussed. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.2519;Some constraints on the lower mass limit for double-degenerate  progenitors of Type Ia supernovae; Xuefei Chen,  Jeffery C. Simon,  Xianfei Zhang,  Zhanwen Han;  Recent theoretical and observational studies both argue that the merging of double carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (WDs) is responsible for at least some Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Previous (standard) studies of the anticipated SN birthrate from this channel have assumed that the merger process is conservative and that the primary criterion for explosion is that the merged mass exceeds the Chandrasekhar mass. Han & Webbink (1999) demonstrated that mass transfer and merger in close double WDs will in many cases be non-conservative. Pakmor et al. (2011) further suggested that the merger process should be violent in order to initiate an explosion. We have therefore investigated how the SN Ia birthrate from the double-degenerate (DD) channel is affected by these constraints. Using the binary-star population-synthesis method, we have calculated the DD SN Ia birthrate under conservative and non-conservative approximations, and including lower mass and mass-ratio limits indicated by recent smoothed-particle-hydrodynamic calculations. The predicted DD SN Ia rate is significantly reduced by all of these constraints. With dynamical mass loss alone (violent merger) the birthrate is reduced to 56% of the conservative rate. Requiring that the mass ratio $q>2/3$ further reduces the birthrate to 18% that of the standard assumption. An upper limit of 0.0061 SNuM, or a Galactic rate of $4.6 \times 10^{-4}{\rm yr}^{-1}$, might be realistic. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Thielemann;  Neutrino-driven winds, which follow core-collapse supernova explosions, present a fascinating nuclear astrophysics problem that requires understanding advanced astrophysics simulations, the properties of matter and neutrino interactions under extreme conditions, the structure and reactions of exotic nuclei, and comparisons against forefront astronomical observations. The neutrino-driven wind has attracted vast attention over the last 20 years as it was suggested to be a candidate for the astrophysics site where half of the heavy elements are produced via the r-process. In this review, we summarize our present understanding of neutrino-driven winds from the dynamical and nucleosynthesis perspectives. Rapid progress has been made during recent years in understanding the wind with improved simulations and better micro physics. The current status of the fields is that hydrodynamical simulations do not reach the extreme conditions necessary for the r-process and the proton or neutron richness of the wind remains to be investigated in more detail. However, nucleosynthesis studies and observations point already to neutrino-driven winds to explain the origin of lighter heavy elements, such as Sr, Y, Zr. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)"

Weigelt;  It is known that scattering of radiation by circumstellar dust can strongly change the line profiles in stellar spectra. This hampers the analysis of spectral lines originating in the emitting regions of heavily obscured young stars. To calculate the line profile of the scattered radiation, we suggest to use the approximation of remote scattering particles. This approximation assumes that the scattering dust grains are at a distance from the star that is much larger than the characteristic size of the emitting region. Using this method, we calculated the line profiles of several simple models. They show the H alpha line profiles of Herbig AeBe stars in the presence and absence of motionless or moving dust. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Rudnitskij,  J.A. Yates;"  Cool, evolved stars undergo copious mass loss but the details of how the matter is returned to the ISM are still under debate. We investigated the structure and evolution of the wind at 5 to 50 stellar radii from Asymptotic Giant Branch and Red Supergiant stars. 22-GHz water masers around seven evolved stars were imaged using MERLIN, at sub-AU resolution. Each source was observed at between 2 and 7 epochs (several stellar periods). We compared our results with long-term Pushchino single dish monitoring. The 22-GHz emission is located in ~spherical, thick, unevenly filled shells. The outflow velocity doubles between the inner and outer shell limits. Water maser clumps could be matched at successive epochs separated by <2 years for AGB stars, or at least 5 years for RSG. This is much shorter than the decades taken for the wind to cross the maser shell, and comparison with spectral monitoring shows that some features fade and reappear. In 5 sources, most of the matched features brighten or dim in concert from one epoch to the next. One cloud in W Hya was caught in the act of passing in front of a background cloud leading to 50-fold, transient amplification. The masing clouds are 1-2 orders of magnitude denser than the wind average and contain a substantial fraction of the mass loss in this region, with a filling factor <1%. The RSG clouds are ~10x bigger than those round the AGB stars. Proper motions are dominated by expansion, with no systematic rotation. The maser clouds survive for decades (the shell crossing time) but the masers are not always beamed in our direction. Radiative effects cause changes in flux density throughout the maser shells on short timescales. Cloud size is proportional to parent star size; clouds have a similar radius to the star in the 22-GHz maser shell. Stellar properties such as convection cells must determine the clumping scale.

Bjorkman;  Be stars possess gaseous circumstellar disks that modify in many ways the spectrum of the central B star. Furthermore, they exhibit variability at several timescales and for a large number of observables. Putting the pieces together of this dynamical behavior is not an easy task and requires a detailed understanding of the physical processes that control the temporal evolution of the observables. There is an increasing body of evidence that suggests that Be disks are well described by standard $\alpha$-disk theory. This paper is the first of a series that aims at studying the possibility of inferring several disk and stellar parameters through the follow-up of various observables. Here we study the temporal evolution of the disk density for different dynamical scenarios, including the disk build-up as a result of a long and steady mass injection from the star, the disk dissipation that occurs after mass injection is turned off, as well as scenarios in which active periods are followed by periods of quiescence. For those scenarios, we investigate the temporal evolution of continuum photometric observables using a 3-D non-LTE radiative transfer code. We show that lightcurves for different wavelengths are specific of a mass loss history, inclination angle and $\alpha$ viscosity parameter. The diagnostic potential of those lightcurves is also discussed. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.2656;Comparisons of CME morphological characteristics derived from five 3D  reconstruction methods; Li Feng,  Bernd Inhester,  Mierla Marilena;  We compare different methods to reconstruct the three-dimensional (3D) CME morphology. The explored methods include geometric localisation, mask fitting, forward modeling, polarisation ratio and local correlation tracking plus triangulation. The five methods are applied to the same CME event, which occurred on August 7 2010. Their corresponding results are presented and compared, especially in their propagation direction and spatial extent in 3D. We find that mask fitting and geometric localisation method produce consistent results. Reconstructions including three-view observations are more precise than reconstructions done with only two views. Compared to the forward modeling method, in which a-priori shape of the CME geometry is assumed, mask fitting has more flexibility. Polarisation ratio method makes use of the Thomson scattering geometry. We find spatially the 3D CME derived from mask fitting lies mostly in the overlap region obtained with the polarisation method from COR2 A and B. In addition, mask fitting can help resolve the front/back ambiguity inherent in the polarisation ratio method. However, local correlation tracking plus triangulation did not show a consistent result with the other four methods. For reconstructions of a diffuse CME, when the separation angle between STEREO A and B is large, finding two corresponding points in a STEREO image pair becomes very difficult. Excluding the local correlation tracking method, the latitude of the CME's centre of gravity derived from the other methods deviates within one degree and longitude differs within 19 degrees. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Nevertheless, only a few molecules have been detected in disks so far. We take advantage of the enhanced capabilities of the IRAM 30m telescope by using the new broad band correlator (FTS) to search for so far undetected molecules in the protoplanetary disks surrounding the TTauri stars DM Tau, GO Tau, LkCa 15 and the Herbig Ae star MWC 480. We report the first detection of HC3N at 5 sigma in the GO Tau and MWC 480 disks with the IRAM 30-m, and in the LkCa 15 disk (5 sigma), using the IRAM array, with derived column densities of the order of 10^{12}cm^{-2}. We also obtain stringent upper limits on CCS (N < 1.5 x 10^{12} cm^{-3}). We discuss the observational results by comparing them to column densities derived from existing chemical disk models (computed using the chemical code Nautilus) and based on previous nitrogen and sulfur-bearing molecule observations. The observed column densities of HC3N are typically two orders of magnitude lower than the existing predictions and appear to be lower in the presence of strong UV flux, suggesting that the molecular chemistry is sensitive to the UV penetration through the disk. The CCS upper limits reinforce our model with low elemental abundance of sulfur derived from other sulfur-bearing molecules (CS, H2S and SO). ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)"

During the superoutburst which started on 2011 January 16, we detected negative superhumps having a period of 0.062242(9) d, shorter than the orbital period by 2.2%. No evidence of positive superhumps was detected during this observation. This finding indicates that the disk exhibited retrograde precession during this superoutburst, contrary to all other known cases of superoutbursts. The duration of this superoutburst was shorter than those of ordinary superoutbursts and the intervals of normal outbursts were longer than ordinary ones. We suggest a possibility that such unusual outburst properties are likely a result of the disk tilt, which is supposed to be a cause of negative superhumps: the tilted disk could prevent the disk from being filled with materials in the outmost region which is supposed to be responsible for long-duration superoutbursts in ER UMa-type dwarf novae. The discovery signifies the importance of the classical prograde precession in sustaining long-duration superoutbursts. Furthermore, the presence of pronounced negative superhumps in this system with a high mass-transfer rate favors the hypothesis that hydrodynamical lift is the cause of the disk tilt.

Caldwell;"  Stellar models generally use simple parametrizations to treat convection. The most widely used parametrization is the so-called ""Mixing Length Theory"" where the convective eddy sizes are described using a single number, \alpha, the mixing-length parameter. This is a free parameter, and the general practice is to calibrate \alpha using the known properties of the Sun and apply that to all stars. Using data from NASA's Kepler mission we show that using the solar-calibrated \alpha is not always appropriate, and that in many cases it would lead to estimates of initial helium abundances that are lower than the primordial helium abundance. Kepler data allow us to calibrate \alpha for many other stars and we show that for the sample of stars we have studied, the mixing-length parameter is generally lower than the solar value. We studied the correlation between \alpha and stellar properties, and we find that \alpha increases with metallicity. We therefore conclude that results obtained by fitting stellar models or by using population-synthesis models constructed with solar values of \alpha are likely to have large systematic errors. Our results also confirm theoretical expectations that the mixing-length parameter should vary with stellar properties. ";Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

We have measured projected rotational velocities, absolute radial velocities, and pseudo-equivalent widths of atomic lines. 12 of our targets did not have previous measurements in the literature. For the other 24 targets, we confirm previously reported measurements. We find that 13 stars from our sample have vsini below our measurement threshold (12 km/s) whereas four of our targets are fast rotators (vsini > 30 km/s). As fast rotation causes spectral features to be washed out, stars with low projected rotational velocities are sought for radial velocity surveys. At our intermediate spectral resolution we have confirmed the identification of neutral atomic lines reported in Mclean et al. 2007. We also calculated pseudo-equivalent widths (p-EW) of 12 atomic lines. Our results confirm that the p-EW of K I lines are strongly dependent on spectral types. We observe that the p-EW of Fe I and Mn I lines remain fairly constant with later spectral type. We suggest that those lines are particularly suitable for deriving metallicities for late-M dwarfs. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.2783;A Nonlinear Force-Free Magnetic Field Approximation Suitable for Fast  Forward-Fitting to Coronal Loops. II. Numeric Code and Tests; Markus J. Aschwanden,  Anna Malanushenko;  Based on a second-order approximation of nonlinear force-free magnetic field solutions in terms of uniformly twisted field lines derived in Paper I, we develop here a numeric code that is capable to forward-fit such analytical solutions to arbitrary magnetogram (or vector magnetograph) data combined with (stereoscopically triangulated) coronal loop 3D coordinates. We test the code here by forward-fitting to six potential field and six nonpotential field cases simulated with our analytical model, as well as by forward-fitting to an exactly force-free solution of the Low and Lou (1990) model. The forward-fitting tests demonstrate: (i) a satisfactory convergence behavior (with typical misalignment angles of $\mu \approx 1^\circ-10^\circ$), (ii) relatively fast computation times (from seconds to a few minutes), and (iii) the high fidelity of retrieved force-free $\alpha$-parameters ($\alpha_{\rm fit}/\alpha_{\rm model} \approx 0.9-1.0$ for simulations and $\alpha_{\rm fit}/\alpha_{\rm model} \approx 0.7\pm0.3$ for the Low and Lou model). The salient feature of this numeric code is the relatively fast computation of a quasi-forcefree magnetic field, which closely matches the geometry of coronal loops in active regions, and complements the existing {\sl nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF)} codes based on photospheric magnetograms without coronal constraints. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.2787;Solar Stereoscopy with STEREO/EUVI A and B spacecraft from small (6 deg)  to large (170 deg) spacecraft separation angles; Markus J. Aschwanden,  Jean-Pierre Wülser,  Nariaki Nitta,  James Lemen;  We performed for the first time stereoscopic triangulation of coronal loops in active regions over the entire range of spacecraft separation angles ($\alpha_{sep}\approx 6^\circ, 43^\circ, 89^\circ, 127^\circ$, and $170^\circ$). The accuracy of stereoscopic correlation depends mostly on the viewing angle with respect to the solar surface for each spacecraft, which affects the stereoscopic correspondence identification of loops in image pairs. From a simple theoretical model we predict an optimum range of $\alpha_{sep} \approx 22^\circ-125^\circ$, which is also experimentally confirmed. The best accuracy is generally obtained when an active region passes the central meridian (viewed from Earth), which yields a symmetric view for both STEREO spacecraft and causes minimum horizontal foreshortening. For the extended angular range of $\alpha_{sep}\approx 6^\circ-127^{\circ}$ we find a mean 3D misalignment angle of $\mu_{PF} \approx 21^\circ-39^\circ$ of stereoscopically triangulated loops with magnetic potential field models, and $\mu_{FFF} \approx 15^\circ-21^\circ$ for a force-free field model, which is partly caused by stereoscopic uncertainties $\mu_{SE} \approx 9^\circ$. We predict optimum conditions for solar stereoscopy during the time intervals of 2012--2014, 2016--2017, and 2021--2023. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Aschwanden,  Jean-Pierre Wuelser,  Nariaki V. Nitta,  James R. Lemen,  Marc L. DeRosa,  Anna Malanushenko;  The three-dimensional (3D) coordinates of stereoscopically triangulated loops provide strong constraints for magnetic field models of active regions in the solar corona. Here we use STEREO/A and B data from some 500 stereoscopically triangulated loops observed in four active regions (2007 Apr 30, May 9, May 19, Dec 11), together with SOHO/MDI line-of-sight magnetograms. We measure the average misalignment angle between the stereoscopic loops and theoretical magnetic field models, finding a mismatch of $\mu=19^\circ-46^\circ$ for a potential field model, which is reduced to $\mu=14^\circ-19^\circ$ for a non-potential field model parameterized by twist parameters. The residual error is commensurable with stereoscopic measurement errors ($\mu_{SE} \approx 8^\circ-12^\circ$). We developed a potential field code that deconvolves a line-of-sight magnetogram into three magnetic field components $(B_x, B_y, B_z)$, as well as a non-potential field forward-fitting code that determines the full length of twisted loops ($L \approx 50-300$ Mm), the number of twist turns (median $N_{twist}=0.06$), the nonlinear force-free $\alpha$-parameter (median $\alpha \approx 4 \times 10^{-11}$ cm$^{-1}$), and the current density (median $j_z \approx 1500$ Mx cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$). All twisted loops are found to be far below the critical value for kink instability, and Joule dissipation of their currents is found be be far below the coronal heating requirement. The algorithm developed here, based on an analytical solution of nonlinear force-free fields that is accurate to second order (in the force-free parameter $\alpha$), represents the first code that enables fast forward-fitting to photospheric magnetograms and stereoscopically triangulated loops in the solar corona. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

To follow the slow evolution of subsonic motions, various sound-proof equations are in wide use, particularly in stellar astrophysical fluid dynamics. These low-Mach number equations include the anelastic equations. Generally, these equations are valid in nearly adiabatically stratified regions like stellar convection zones, but may not be valid in the sub-adiabatic, stably stratified stellar radiative interiors. Understanding the coupling between the convection zone and the radiative interior is a problem of crucial interest and may have strong implications for solar and stellar dynamo theories as the interface between the two, called the tachocline in the Sun, plays a crucial role in many solar dynamo theories. Here we study the properties of gravity waves in stably-stratified atmospheres. In particular, we explore how gravity waves are handled in various sound-proof equations. We find that some anelastic treatments fail to conserve energy in stably-stratified atmospheres, instead conserving pseudo-energies that depend on the stratification, and we demonstrate this numerically. One anelastic equation set does conserve energy in all atmospheres and we provide recommendations for converting low-Mach number anelastic codes to this set of equations. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)"

We have identified the star in both Hubble Space Telescope images of the host galaxy, obtained 17-18 yr prior to the explosion, and near-infrared ground-based images, obtained 6-12 yr prior to the SN. The luminous supergiant showed evidence for substantial circumstellar dust, manifested as excess line-of-sight extinction. The effective total-to-selective ratio of extinction to the star was R'_V \approx 4.35, which is significantly different from that of diffuse interstellar dust (i.e., R_V=3.1), and the total extinction to the star was therefore, on average, A_V \approx 3.1 mag. We find that the observed spectral energy distribution for the progenitor star is consistent with an effective temperature of 3600 K (spectral type M3), and that the star therefore had a bolometric magnitude of -8.29. Through comparison with recent theoretical massive-star evolutionary tracks we can infer that the red supergiant progenitor had an initial mass 15 \lesssim M_{ini} (M_sun) < 20. Interpolating by eye between the available tracks, we surmise that the star had initial mass ~17-18 M_sun. The circumstellar dust around the progenitor must have been destroyed in the explosion, as the visual extinction to the SN is found to be low (A_V=0.24 mag with R_V=3.1).

The Tool for Automatic Measurement of Equivalent width (TAME)provides the EWs of spectral lines by profile fitting in the automatic or the interactive mode, which can yield a more precise result through the adjustment of the local continuum and fitting parameters. The automatic EW results of TAME have been verified by comparing them with the manual EW measurements by IRAF splot task using the high-resolution spectrum of the Sun, and measuring EWs in the synthetic spectra with different spectral resolutions and S/N ratios. The EWs measured by TAME agree well with manually measured values, with a dispersion of less than 2 mA. By comparing the input EWs for synthetic spectra and EWs measured by TAME, we conclude that it is reliable for measuring the EWs in a spectrum with a spectral resolution, R > 20000 and find that the errors in EWs is less than 1 mA for a S/N ratio > 100. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.2857;The Wave-Driver System of the Off-Disk Coronal Wave 17 January 2010; M. Temmer,  B. Vrsnak,  A. M. Veronig;  We study the 17 January 2010 flare-CME-wave event by using STEREO/SECCHI EUVI and COR1 data. The observational study is combined with an analytic model which simulates the evolution of the coronal-wave phenomenon associated with the event. From EUV observations, the wave signature appears to be dome shaped having a component propagating on the solar surface (v~280 km s-1) as well as off-disk (v~600 km s-1) away from the Sun. The off-disk dome of the wave consists of two enhancements in intensity, which conjointly develop and can be followed up to white-light coronagraph images. Applying an analytic model, we derive that these intensity variations belong to a wave-driver system with a weakly shocked wave, initially driven by expanding loops, which are indicative of the early evolution phase of the accompanying CME. We obtain the shock standoff distance between wave and driver from observations as well as from model results. The shock standoff distance close to the Sun (<0.3 Rs above the solar surface) is found to rapidly increase with values of ~0.03-0.09 Rs which give evidence of an initial lateral (over-)expansion of the CME. The kinematical evolution of the on-disk wave could be modeled using input parameters which require a more impulsive driver (t=90 s, a=1.7 km s-2) compared to the off-disk component (t=340 s, a=1.5 km s-2). ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Chadid,  N. R. Evans,  K. Kinemuchi,  J. M. Nemec,  S. E. Seader,  J. C. Smith,  P. Tenenbaum;  We present a detailed period analysis of the bright Cepheid-type variable star V1154 Cygni (V =9.1 mag, P~4.9 d) based on almost 600 days of continuous observations by the Kepler space telescope. The data reveal significant cycle-to-cycle fluctuations in the pulsation period, indicating that classical Cepheids may not be as accurate astrophysical clocks as commonly believed: regardless of the specific points used to determine the O-C values, the cycle lengths show a scatter of 0.015-0.02 days over the 120 cycles covered by the observations. A very slight correlation between the individual Fourier parameters and the O-C values was found, suggesting that the O - C variations might be due to the instability of the light curve shape. Random fluctuation tests revealed a linear trend up to a cycle difference 15, but for long term, the period remains around the mean value. We compare the measurements with simulated light curves that were constructed to mimic V1154 Cyg as a perfect pulsator modulated only by the light travel time effect caused by low-mass companions. We show that the observed period jitter in V1154 Cyg represents a serious limitation in the search for binary companions. While the Kepler data are accurate enough to allow the detection of planetary bodies in close orbits around a Cepheid, the astrophysical noise can easily hide the signal of the light-time effect. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.3070;Spectroscopy and Photometry of Cataclysmic Variable Candidates from the  Catalina Real Time Survey; John R. Thorstensen,  Julie N. Skinner;  The Catalina Real Time Survey (CRTS) has found over 500 cataclysmic variable (CV) candidates, most of which were previously unknown. We report here on followup spectroscopy of 36 of the brighter objects. Nearly all the spectra are typical of CVs at minimum light. One object appears to be a flare star, while another has a spectrum consistent with a CV but lies, intriguingly, at the center of a small nebulosity. We measured orbital periods for eight of the CVs, and estimated distances for two based on the spectra of their secondary stars. In addition to the spectra, we obtained direct imaging for an overlapping sample of 37 objects, for which we give magnitudes and colors. Most of our new orbital periods are shortward of the so-called period gap from roughly 2 to 3 hours. By considering the cross-identifications between the Catalina objects and other catalogs such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we argue that a large number of cataclysmic variables remain uncatalogued. By comparing the CRTS sample to lists of previously-known CVs that CRTS does not recover, we find that the CRTS is biased toward large outburst amplitudes (and hence shorter orbital periods). We speculate that this is a consequence of the survey cadence. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.3090;Reevaluating the Mass-Radius Relation for Low-Mass, Main Sequence Stars; Gregory A. Feiden,  Brian Chaboyer;  We examine the agreement between the observed and theoretical low-mass (< 0.8 solar masses) stellar main sequence mass-radius relationship by comparing detached eclipsing binary (DEB) data with a new, large grid of stellar evolution models. The new grid allows for a realistic variation in the age and metallicity of the DEB population, characteristic of the local galactic neighborhood. Overall, our models do a reasonable job of reproducing the observational data. A large majority of the models match the observed stellar radii to within 4%, with a mean absolute error of 2.3%. These results represent a factor of two improvement compared to previous examinations of the low-mass mass-radius relationship. The improved agreement between models and observations brings the radius deviations within the limits imposed by potential starspot-related uncertainties for 92% of the stars in our DEB sample. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.3295;Testing Disk-Locking in NGC 2264; P. Wilson Cauley,  Christopher M. Johns-Krull,  Catrina M. Hamilton,  Kelly Lockhart;"  We test analytic predictions from different models of magnetospheric accretion, which invoke disk-locking, using stellar and accretion parameters derived from models of low resolution optical spectra of 36 T Tauri stars (TTSs) in NGC 2264 (age~3 Myrs). Little evidence is found for models that assume purely dipolar field geometries; however, strong support is found in the data for a modified version of the X-wind model (Shu et al. 1994) which allows for non-dipolar field geometries. The trapped flux concept in the X-wind model is key to making the analytic predictions which appear supported in the data. By extension, our analysis provides support for the outflows predicted by the X-wind as these also originate in the trapped flux region. In addition, we find no support in the data for accretion powered stellar winds from young stars. By comparing the analysis presented here of NGC 2264 with a similar analysis of stars in Taurus (age~1-2 Myr), we find evidence that the equilibrium interaction between the magnetic field and accretion disk in TTS systems evolves as the stars grow older, perhaps as the result of evolution of the stellar magnetic field geometry. We compare the accretion rates we derive with accretion rates based on U-band excess, finding good agreement. In addition, we use our accretion parameters to determine the relationship between accretion and H-beta luminosity, again finding good agreement with previously published results; however, we also find that care must be used when applying this relationship due to strong chromospheric emission in young stars which can lead to erroneous results in some cases.

Combining our MIPS observations with those of other ScoCen stars in the literature, we estimate 24 {\mu}m B+A-type disk fractions of 17/67 (25+6%), 36/131 (27+4%), and 23/95 (24+5%) for Upper Scorpius (\sim11 Myr), Upper Centaurus Lupus (\sim15 Myr), and Lower Centaurus Crux (\sim17 Myr), respectively, somewhat smaller disk fractions than previously obtained for F- and G-type members. We confirm previous IRAS excess detections and present new discoveries of 51 protoplanetary and debris disk systems, with fractional infrared luminosities ranging from LIR/L\ast = 1e-6 to 1e-2 and grain temperatures ranging from Tgr = 40 - 300 K. In addition, we confirm that the 24 {\mu}m and 70 {\mu}m excesses (or fractional infrared luminosities) around B+A type stars are smaller than those measured toward F+G type stars and hypothesize that the observed disk property dependence on stellar mass may be the result of a higher stellar companion fraction around B- and A-type stars at 10 - 200 AU and/or the presence of Jupiter-mass companions in the disks around F- and G- type stars. Finally, we note that the majority of the ScoCen 24 {\mu}m excess sources also possess 12 {\mu}m excess, indicating that Earth-like planets may be forming via collisions in the terrestrial planet zone at \sim10 - 100 Myr. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)"

Mora,  G. Aresu,  S. Brittain,  W. F. R. Dent,  C. Pinte,  G. J. White;"  Observations of the atomic and molecular line emission associated with jets and outflows emitted by young stellar objects can be used to trace the various evolutionary stages they pass through as they evolve to become main sequence stars. To understand the relevance of atomic and molecular cooling in shocks, and how accretion and ejection efficiency evolves with the source evolutionary state, we will study the far-infrared counterparts of bright optical jets associated with Class I and II sources in Taurus (T Tau, DG Tau A, DG Tau B, FS Tau A+B, and RW Aur). We have analysed Herschel/PACS observations of a number of atomic ([OI]63um, 145um, [CII]158um) and molecular (high-J CO, H2O, OH) lines, collected within the OTKP GASPS. To constrain the origin of the detected lines we have compared the FIR emission maps with the emission from optical-jets and millimetre-outflows, and the line fluxes and ratios with predictions from shock and disk models. All of the targets are associated with extended emission in the atomic lines correlated with the direction of the optical jet/mm-outflow. The atomic lines can be excited in fast dissociative J-shocks. The molecular emission, on the contrary, originates from a compact region, that is spatially and spectrally unresolved. Slow C- or J- shocks with high pre-shock densities reproduce the observed H2O and high-J CO lines; however, the disk and/or UV-heated outflow cavities may contribute to the emission. While the cooling is dominated by CO and H2O lines in Class 0 sources, [OI] becomes an important coolant as the source evolves and the environment is cleared. The cooling and mass loss rates estimated for Class II and I sources are one to four orders of magnitude lower than for Class 0 sources. This provides strong evidence to indicate that the outflow activity decreases as the source evolves. ";Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

";"  A long-term multi-purpose observational programme has started with HARPS-N@TNG aimed to characterise the global architectural properties of exoplanetary systems. In this first paper we fully characterise the transiting system Qatar-1. We exploit HARPS-N high-precision radial velocity measurements obtained during a transit to measure the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect in the Qatar-1 system, and out-of-transit measurements to redetermine the spectroscopic orbit. New photometric transit light-curves are analysed and a spectroscopic characterisation of the host star atmospheric parameters is performed based on various methods (line equivalent width ratios, spectral synthesis, spectral energy distribution). We achieved a significant improvement in the accuracy of the orbital parameters and derived the spin-orbit alignment of the system; this information, combined with the spectroscopic determination of the host star properties, allows us to derive the fundamental physical parameters for star and planet (masses and radii). The orbital solution for the Qatar-1 system is consistent with a circular orbit and the system presents a sky-projected obliquity of lambda = -8.4+-7.1 deg. The planet, with a mass of 1.33+-0.05 M_J, is found to be significantly more massive than previously reported. The host star is confirmed to be metal-rich ([Fe/H]= 0.20+-0.10) and slowly rotating (vsinI = 1.7+-0.3 km/s), though moderately active, as indicated by strong chromospheric emission in the Ca II H&K line cores (logR'_HK about -4.60). The system is well aligned and fits well within the general lambda vs Teff trend. We definitely rule out any significant orbital eccentricity. The evolutionary status of the system is inferred based on gyrochronology, and the present orbital configuration and timescale for orbital decay are discussed in terms of star-planet tidal interactions.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.0087;Observations of CMEs and Models of the Eruptive Corona; Nat Gopalswamy;  Current theoretical ideas on the internal structure of CMEs suggest that a flux rope is central to the CME structure, which has considerable observational support both from remote-sensing and in-situ observations. The flux-rope nature is also consistent with the post-eruption arcades with high-temperature plasmas and the charge states observed within CMEs arriving at Earth. The model involving magnetic loop expansion to explain CMEs without flux ropes is not viable because it contradicts CME kinematics and flare properties near the Sun. The flux rope is fast, it drives a shock, so the global picture of CMEs becomes complete if one includes the shock sheath to the CSHKP model. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Hernandez,  L. Ingleby,  K. L. Luhman,  P. D'Alessio,  B. Sargent;  Using NASA IRTF SpeX data from 0.8 to 4.5 $\mu$m, we determine self-consistently the stellar properties and excess emission above the photosphere for a sample of classical T Tauri stars (CTTS) in the Taurus molecular cloud with varying degrees of accretion. This process uses a combination of techniques from the recent literature as well as observations of weak-line T Tauri stars (WTTS) to account for the differences in surface gravity and chromospheric activity between the TTS and dwarfs, which are typically used as photospheric templates for CTTS. Our improved veiling and extinction estimates for our targets allow us to extract flux-calibrated spectra of the excess in the near-infrared. We find that we are able to produce an acceptable parametric fit to the near-infrared excesses using a combination of up to three blackbodies. In half of our sample, two blackbodies at temperatures of 8000 K and 1600 K suffice. These temperatures and the corresponding solid angles are consistent with emission from the accretion shock on the stellar surface and the inner dust sublimation rim of the disk, respectively. In contrast, the other half requires three blackbodies at 8000, 1800, and 800 K, to describe the excess. We interpret the combined two cooler blackbodies as the dust sublimation wall with either a contribution from the disk surface beyond the wall or curvature of the wall itself, neither of which should have single-temperature blackbody emission. In these fits, we find no evidence of a contribution from optically thick gas inside the inner dust rim. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)"

Comparison with the  Sun on Different Timescales; Gibor Basri (1),  Lucianne Walkowicz (2),  Ansgar Reiners (3) ((1) UC Berkeley, (2) Princeton, (3) Georg-August-University Goettingen);"  We utilize Kepler data to study the precision differential photometric variability of solar-type and cooler stars at different timescales, ranging from half an hour to 3 months. We define a diagnostic that characterizes the median differential intensity change between data bins of a given timescale. We apply the same diagnostics to SOHO data that has been rendered comparable to Kepler. The Sun exhibits similar photometric variability on all timescales as comparable solar-type stars in the Kepler field (it is not unusually quiet). The previously-defined photometric ""range"" serves as our activity proxy (driven by starspot coverage). We revisit the fraction of comparable stars in the Kepler field that are more active than the Sun. The exact active fraction depends on what is meant by ""more active than the Sun"", and on the magnitude limit of the sample of stars considered. This active fraction is between a quarter and a third (depending on the timescale). We argue that a reliable result requires timescales of half a day or longer and stars brighter than Kepler magnitude of 14, otherwise non-stellar noise distorts it. We also analyze main sequence stars grouped by temperature from 6500-3500K. As one moves to cooler stars, the active fraction of stars becomes steadily larger (greater than 90% for early M dwarfs). The Sun is a good photometric model at all timescales for those cooler stars that have long-term variability within the span of solar variability. ";Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Meftah;  Several efforts are currently made from space missions in order to get accurate solar astrometric measurements i.e. to probe the long term variations of solar radius or shape, their link with solar irradiance variations and their influence on earth climate. These space missions use full disk solar imagery. In order to test our ability to perform such measurements from ground on the long term, we need to use similar techniques and instruments simultaneously from ground and space. This should help us to model and understand how the atmosphere affect ground based metrologic measurements. However, using full imagery from ground instead of the traditional astrolabe technique immediatly raise the question of the effect of refraction and how well we can correct from it. The goal is to study in details the influence of pure astronomical refraction on solar metrologic measurements made from ground-based full disk imagery and to provide the tools for correcting the measurements and estimating the associated uncertainties. We use both analytical and numerical methods in order to confront commonly or historically used approximations and exact solutions. We provide the exact formulae for correcting solar radius measurements at any heliographic angle and for any zenith distance. We show that these corrections can be applyed up to 80 degree of zenith distance provided that full numerical integration of the refraction integral is used. We also provide estimates of the absolute uncertainties associated with the differential refraction corrections and shows that approximate formulae can be used up to 80 degree of zenith distance for computing these uncertainties. For a given instrumental setup and the knowledge of the uncertainties associated with local weather records, this can be used to fix the maximum zenith distance one can observe depending on the required astrometric accuracy. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.0165;Eruption of a plasma blob, associated M-class flare, and large-scale EUV  wave observed by SDO; Pankaj Kumar,  P.K. Manoharan;"  We present a multiwavelength study of the formation and ejection of a plasma blob and associated EUV waves in AR NOAA 11176, observed by SDO/AIA and STEREO on 25 March 2011. SDO/AIA images clearly show the formation and ejection of a plasma blob from the lower solar atmosphere at ~9 min prior to the onset of the M1.0 flare. This onset of the M-class flare happened at the site of the blob formation, while the blob was rising in a parabolic path with an average speed of ~300 km/s. The blob also showed twisting and de-twisting motion in the lower corona, and the blob speed varied from ~10-540 km/s. The faster and slower EUV wavefronts were observed in front of the plasma blob during its impulsive acceleration phase. The faster EUV wave propagated with a speed of ~785 to 1020 km/s, whereas the slower wavefront speed varied in between ~245 and 465 km/s. The timing and speed of the faster wave match the shock speed estimated from the drift rate of the associated type II radio burst. The faster wave experiences a reflection by the nearby AR NOAA 11177. In addition, secondary waves were observed (only in the 171 \AA channel), when the primary fast wave and plasma blob impacted the funnel-shaped coronal loops. The HMI magnetograms revealed the continuous emergence of new magnetic flux along with shear flows at the site of the blob formation. It is inferred that the emergence of twisted magnetic fields in the form of arch-filaments/""anemone-type"" loops is the likely cause for the plasma blob formation and associated eruption along with the triggering of M-class flare. Furthermore, the faster EUV wave formed ahead of the blob shows the signature of fast-mode MHD wave, whereas the slower wave seems to be generated by the field line compression by the plasma blob. The secondary wave trains originated from the funnel-shaped loops are probably the fast magnetoacoustic waves. ";Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Mueller;  Intermittent large-scale high-shear flows are found to occur frequently and spontaneously in direct numerical simulations of statistically stationary turbulent Boussinesq magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) convection. The energetic steady-state of the system is sustained by convective driving of the velocity field and small-scale dynamo action. The intermittent emergence of flow structures with strong velocity and magnetic shearing generates magnetic energy at an elevated rate over time-scales longer than the characteristic time of the large-scale convective motion. The resilience of magnetic energy amplification suggests that intermittent shear-bursts are a significant driver of dynamo action in turbulent magnetoconvection. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)"

Gredel,  M. Smith,  Th. Stanke;  We aim to take a census of molecular hydrogen emission line objects (MHOs) in the Rho Ophiuchi molecular cloud and to make the first systematic proper motion measurements of these objects in this region. Deep H2 near-infrared imaging is performed to search for molecular hydrogen emission line objects. Multi-epoch data are used to derive the proper motions of the features of these objects, and the lengths and opening angles of the molecular hydrogen outflows. Our imaging covers an area of about 0.11 deg2 toward the L1688 core in the Rho Ophiuchi molecular cloud. In total, six new MHOs are discovered, 32 previously known MHOs are detected, and the proper motions for 86 features of the MHOs are measured. The proper motions lie in the range of 14 to 247 mas/yr, corresponding to transversal velocities of 8 to 140 km s-1 with a median velocity of about 35 km s-1. Based on morphology and proper motion measurements, 27 MHOs are ascribed to 21 driving sources. The molecular hydrogen outflows have a median length of about 0.04 pc and random orientations. We find no obvious correlation between H2 jet length, jet opening angle, and the evolutionary stage of the driving sources as defined by their spectral indices. We find that the fraction of protostars (23%) that drive molecular hydrogen outflows is similar to the one for Class II sources (15%). For most molecular hydrogen outflows, no obvious velocity variation along the outflow has been found. In Ophiuchus the frequency of occurrence of molecular hydrogen outflows has no strong dependency on the evolutionary stage of the driving source during the evolution from the protostellar stage to the classical T Tauri stage. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Silverman (3),  Mohan Ganeshalingam,  S. Bradley Cenko,  Kelsey I. Clubb (1) ((1) UC Berkeley, (2) University of Virginia, (3) UT Austin);  Type IIn supernovae (SNe IIn) are a rare (< 10%) subclass of core-collapse SNe that exhibit relatively narrow emission lines from a dense, pre-existing circumstellar medium (CSM). In 2009, a warm Spitzer survey observed 30 SNe IIn discovered in 2003 - 2008 and detected 10 SNe at distances out to 175 Mpc with unreported late-time infrared emission, in some cases more than 5 years post-discovery. For this single epoch of data, the warm-dust parameters suggest the presence of a radiative heating source consisting of optical/X-ray emission continuously generated by ongoing CSM interaction. Here we present multi-wavelength follow-up observations of this sample of 10 SNe IIn and the well-studied Type IIn SN 2010jl. A recent epoch of Spitzer observations reveals ongoing mid-infrared emission from nine of the SNe in this sample. We also detect three of the SNe in archival WISE data, in addition to SNe 1987A, 2004dj, and 2008iy. For at least five of the SNe in the sample, optical and/or X-ray emission confirms the presence of radiative emission from ongoing CSM interaction. The two Spitzer nondetections are consistent with the forward shock overrunning and destroying the dust shell, a result that places upper limits on the dust-shell size. The optical and infrared observations confirm the radiative heating model and constrain a number of model parameters, including progenitor mass-loss characteristics. All of the SNe in this sample experienced an outburst on the order of tens to hundreds of years prior to the SN explosion followed by periods of less intense mass loss. Although all evidence points to massive progenitors, the variation in the data highlights the diversity in SN IIn progenitor evolution. While these observations do not identify a particular progenitor system, they demonstrate that future, coordinated, multi-wavelength campaigns can constrain theoretical mass-loss models. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.0349;Influence of surface stressing on stellar coronae and winds; M. Jardine,  A. A. Vidotto,  A. van Ballegooijen,  J.-F. Donati,  J. Morin,  R. Fares,  T.I Gombosi;  The large-scale field of the Sun is well represented by its lowest energy (or potential) state. Recent observations, by comparison, reveal that many solar-type stars show large-scale surface magnetic fields that are highly non-potential - that is, they have been stressed above their lowest-energy state. This non-potential component of the surface field is neglected by current stellar wind models. The aim of this paper is to determine its effect on the coronal structure and wind. We use Zeeman-Doppler surface magnetograms of two stars - one with an almost potential, one with a non-potential surface field - to extrapolate a static model of the coronal structure for each star. We find that the stresses are carried almost exclusively in a band of uni-directional azimuthal field that is confined to mid-latitudes. Using this static solution as an initial state for an MHD wind model, we then find that the final state is determined primarily by the potential component of the surface magnetic field. The band of azimuthal field must be confined close to the stellar surface as it is not compatible with a steady-state wind. By artificially increasing the stellar rotation rate we demonstrate that the observed azimuthal fields can not be produced by the action of the wind but must be due to processes at or below the stellar surface. We conclude that the background winds of solar-like stars are largely unaffected by these highly-stressed surface fields. Nonetheless, the increased flare activity and associated coronal mass ejections that may be expected to accompany such highly-stressed fields may have a significant impact on any surrounding planets. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

In this note the lines are treated as recombination lines from a highly ionized environment and differences between H and He, previously unexplained, are understood in terms of the different ionization potentials.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.0384;Microwave View on Particle Acceleration in Flares; Gregory D. Fleishman;"  The thermal-to-nonthermal partition was found to vary greatly from one flare to another resulting in a broad variety of cases from 'heating without acceleration' to 'acceleration without heating'. Recent analysis of microwave data of these differing cases suggests that a similar acceleration mechanism, forming a power-law nonthermal tail up to a few MeV or even higher, operates in all the cases. However, the level of this nonthermal spectrum compared to the original thermal distribution differs significantly from one case to another, implying a highly different thermal-to-nonthermal energy partition in various cases. This further requires a specific mechanism capable of extracting the charged particles from the thermal pool and supplying them to a bulk acceleration process to operate in flares \textit{in addition} to the bulk acceleration process itself, which, in contrast, efficiently accelerates the seed particles, while cannot accelerate the thermal particles. Within this 'microwave' view on the flare energy partition and particle acceleration I present a few contrasting examples of acceleration regions detected with microwave data and compare them with the most popular acceleration mechanisms---in DC fields, in collapsing traps, and stochastic acceleration by a turbulence spectrum - to identify the key elements needed to conform with observations. In particular, I point out that the turbulence needed to drive the particle acceleration is generated in nonpotential magnetic structures, which results in nonzero helicity of the turbulence. This helicity, in its turn, produces a nonzero mean DC electric field on top of stochastic turbulent fields driving the main stochastic acceleration; thus, acceleration by helical turbulence combines properties of the standard stochastic acceleration with some features of acceleration in DC electric fields, exactly what is demanded by observation.

Griffith;  With the aim of connecting the compositions of stars and planets, we present the abundances of carbon and oxygen, as well as iron and nickel, for the transiting exoplanet host star XO-2N and its wide-separation binary companion XO-2S. Stellar parameters are derived from high-resolution, high-signal-to-noise spectra, and the two stars are found to be similar in their Teff, log g, iron ([Fe/H]), nickel ([Ni/H]) abundances. Their carbon ([C/H]) and oxygen ([O/H]) abundances also overlap within errors, although XO-2N may be slightly more C-rich and O-rich than XO-2S. The C/O ratios of both stars (~0.60+/-0.20) may also be somewhat larger than solar (C/O~0.50). The XO-2 system has a transiting hot Jupiter orbiting one binary component but not the other, allowing us to probe the potential effects planet formation might have on the host star composition. Additionally, with multiple observations of its atmosphere the transiting exoplanet XO-2b lends itself to compositional analysis, which can be compared to the natal chemical environment established by our binary star elemental abundances. This work sets the stage for determining how similar/different exoplanet and host star compositions are, and the implications for planet formation, by discussing the C/O ratio measurements in the unique environment of a visual binary system with one star hosting a transiting hot Jupiter. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)"

Phillips (2),  Janusz Sylwester (2),  Barbara Sylwester (2) ((1) MIT, (2) Space Research Center, Polish Academy of Sciences);  Chandra HETG spectra of the coronally active binary stars sigma Gem and HR 1099 are among the highest fluence observations for such systems taken at high spectral resolution in x-rays with this instrument. We compare their properties to solar flare spectra obtained with the Russian CORONAS-F RESIK instrument at similar resolution in an overlapping bandpass. We emphasize the comparisons of the 3.3-6.1 A region from solar flare spectra to the corresponding sigma Gem and HR 1099 spectra. We also model the the HETG spectra from 1.7-25 A to determine coronal temperatures and elemental abundances. Sigma Gem is a single lined coronally active long period binary which has a very hot corona. HR 1099 is a similar, but shorter period, double lined system. In the deep exposures we study emission from some of the weaker species, such as K, Na, and Al, which have the lowest first ionization potentials (FIP). The solar flare temperatures reach ~20 MK, comparable to the sigma Gem and HR 1099 coronae. During the Chandra exposures, sigma Gem was slowly decaying from a flare and its spectrum is well characterized by a collisional ionization equilibrium plasma with a broad temperature distribution ranging from 2-60 MK, peaking near 25 MK, but with substantial emission from 50 MK plasma. We have detected K XVIII and Na XI emission which allow us to set limits on their abundances. HR 1099 was also in a flare state but had no detectable K XVIII. These measurements provide new comparisons of solar and stellar coronal abundances, especially at the lowest FIP values. The low FIP elements do not show enhancement in the stellar coronae as they do in the Sun, except for K in sigma Gem. Sigma Gem and HR 1099 differ in their emission measure distributions but have very similar elemental abundances. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.0414;MESA and NuGrid Simulations of Classical Nova Outbursts and  Nucleosynthesis; Pavel Denissenkov (UVic),  Falk Herwig (UVic),  Marco Pignatari (Basel),  James Truran (Chicago);  Classical novae are the results of surface thermonuclear explosions of hydrogen accreted by white dwarfs (WDs) from their low-mass main-sequence or red-giant binary companions. Chemical composition analysis of their ejecta shows that nova outbursts occur on both carbon-oxygen (CO) and more massive oxygen-neon (ONe) WDs, and that there is cross-boundary mixing between the accreted envelope and underlying WD. We demonstrate that the state-of-the-art stellar evolution code MESA and post-processing nucleosynthesis tools of NuGrid can successfully be used for modeling of CO and ONe nova outbursts and nucleosynthesis. The convective boundary mixing (CBM) in our 1D numerical simulations is implemented using a diffusion coefficient that is exponentially decreasing with a distance below the bottom of the convective envelope. We show that this prescription produces maximum temperature evolution profiles and nucleosynthesis yields in good agreement with those obtained using the commonly adopted 1D nova model in which the CBM is mimicked by assuming that the accreted envelope has been pre-mixed with WD's material. In a previous paper, we have found that 3He can be produced in situ in solar-composition envelopes accreted with slow rates (dM/dt < 1e-10 M_sun/yr) by cold (T_WD < 1d7 K) CO WDs, and that convection is triggered by 3He burning before the nova outburst in this case. Here, we confirm this result for ONe novae. Additionally, we find that the interplay between the 3He production and destruction in the solar-composition envelope accreted with an intermediate rate, e.g. dM/dt = 1e-10 M_sun/yr, by the 1.15 M_sun ONe WD with a relatively high initial central temperature, e.g. T_WD = 15e6 K, leads to the formation of a thick radiative buffer zone that separates the bottom of the convective envelope from the WD surface. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

The median angular resolution in the survey is 2.5 arcsec, while the median linear resolution is approximately 600 AU. Compact dust continuum emission is observed from all sources in the sample. Twenty-one sources in the sample show signatures of binarity/multiplicity, with separations ranging from 50 to 5000 AU. The numbers of singles, binaries, triples, and quadruples in the sample are 12, 14, 5, and 2, respectively. The derived multiplicity frequency (MF) and companion star fraction (CSF) for Class 0 protostars are 0.64+/-0.08 and 0.91+/-0.05, respectively, with no correction for completeness. The derived MF and CSF in this survey are approximately two times higher than the values found in the binary surveys toward Class I YSOs, and approximately three (for MF) and four (for CSF) times larger than the values found among MS stars, with a similar range of separations. Furthermore, the observed fraction of high order multiple systems to binary systems in Class 0 protostars (0.50+/-0.09) is also larger than the fractions found in Class I YSOs (0.31+/-0.07) and MS stars (< 0.2). These results suggest that binary properties evolve as protostars evolve, as predicted by numerical simulations. The distribution of separations for Class 0 protostellar binary systems shows a general trend in which companion star fraction increases with decreasing companion separation. We find that 67%+/-8% of the protobinary systems have circumstellar mass ratios below 0.5, implying that unequal-mass systems are preferred in the process of binary star formation. We suggest an empirical sequential fragmentation picture for binary star formation. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

We have chosen to combine the abundance ratios from five similar data sets in order to reduce systematic effects that may have caused inconsistencies. With these collated relative abundance measurements, we find that the {\alpha} Cen system and the Sun were likely formed from the same material, despite the [Fe/H] enrichment observed in the {\alpha} Cen binaries: 0.28 and 0.31 dex, respectively. Both {\alpha} Centauri A and B exhibit relative abundance ratios that are generally solar, with the mean at 0.002 and 0.03 dex, respectively. The refractory elements (condensation temperature > 900 K) in each have a mean of -0.02 and 0.01 dex and a 1{\sigma} uncertainty of 0.09 and 0.11 dex, respectively.

Our twelve nights of photometric time-series reveal a quasi-periodic (P = 4.87+-0.01 h) variability with a maximal peak-peak amplitude of ~11% and strong night-to-night evolution. We attribute this variability to the rotational modulation of fast-evolving weather patterns in the atmosphere of the coolest component (~T1-type) of the binary, in agreement with the cloud fragmentation mechanism proposed to drive the spectroscopic morphologies of brown dwarfs at the L/T transition. No periodic signal is detected for the hottest component (~L8-type). For both brown dwarfs, our data allow us to firmly discard any unique transit during our observations for planets >= 2 Rearth.

Yeates;  Coupled flux transport and magneto-frictional simulations are extended to simulate the continuous magnetic field evolution in the global solar corona for over 15 years, from the start of Solar Cycle 23 in 1996. By simplifying the dynamics, our model follows the build-up and transport of electric currents and free magnetic energy in the corona, offering an insight into the magnetic structure and topology that extrapolation-based models can not. To enable these extended simulations, we have implemented a more efficient numerical grid, and have carefully calibrated the surface flux transport model to reproduce the observed large-scale photospheric radial magnetic field, using emerging active regions determined from observed line-of-sight magnetograms. This calibration is described in some detail. In agreement with previous authors, we find that the standard flux transport model is insufficient to simultaneously reproduce the observed polar fields and butterfly diagram during Cycle 23, and that additional effects must be added. For the best-fit model, we use automated techniques to detect the latitude-time profile of flux ropes and their ejections over the full solar cycle. Overall, flux ropes are more prevalent outside of active latitudes but those at active latitudes are more frequently ejected. Future possibilities for space-weather prediction with this approach are briefly assessed. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Raga;"  The morphology, kinematics and entrainment mechanism of the HH 46/47 molecular outflow were studied using new ALMA Cycle 0 observations. Results show that the blue and red lobes are strikingly different. We argue that these differences are partly due to contrasting ambient densities that result in different wind components having a distinct effect on the entrained gas in each lobe. A 29-point mosaic, covering the two lobes at an angular resolution of about 3"", detected outflow emission at much higher velocities than previous observations, resulting in significantly higher estimates of the outflow momentum and kinetic energy than previous studies of this source, using the CO(1-0) line. The morphology and the kinematics of the gas in the blue lobe are consistent with models of outflow entrainment by a wide-angle wind, and a simple model describes the observed structures in the position-velocity diagram and the velocity-integrated intensity maps. The red lobe exhibits a more complex structure, and there is evidence that this lobe is entrained by a wide-angle wind and a collimated episodic wind. Three major clumps along the outflow axis show velocity distribution consistent with prompt entrainment by different bow shocks formed by periodic mass ejection episodes which take place every few hundred years. Position-velocity cuts perpendicular to the outflow cavity show gradients where the velocity increases towards the outflow axis, inconsistent with outflow rotation. Additionally, we find evidence for the existence of a small outflow driven by a binary companion. ";Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

In the penumbra, however, the passage of the running penumbral waves alter the magnetic field strength by some 200 G (peak-to-peak amplitude) but it does not change the field orientation (at least not significantly within our sensitivity of a few degrees). We find a trend of decreasing high-frequency modulation power for more inclined magnetic fields for the line-of-sight velocity and magnetic field strength. In the outer penumbra we find an absence of high frequency power while there is increasingly more power at high frequencies towards the umbra.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.0815;"Population II stars and the Spite plateau; Stellar evolution models with  mass loss"; Mathieu Vick,  Georges Michaud,  Jacques Richer,  Olivier Richard;  We aim to determine the constraints that observed chemical abundances put on the potential role of mass loss in metal poor dwarfs. Self-consistent stellar evolutionary models that include all the effects of atomic diffusion and radiative accelerations for 28 chemical species were computed for stellar masses between 0.6 and 0.8 Msun. Models with an initial metallicity of Z_0=0.00017 and mass loss rates from 10e-15 Msun to 10e-12 Msun were calculated. They were then compared to previous models with mass loss, as well as to models with turbulent mixing. For models with an initial metallicity of Fe/H=-2.31, mass loss rates of about 10e-12 Msun lead to surface abundance profiles that are very similar to those obtained in models with turbulence. Both models have about the same level of agreement with observations of galactic-halo lithium abundances, as well as lithium and other elemental abundances from metal poor globular clusters such as NGC 6397. In this cluster, models with mass loss agree slightly better with subgiant observations of Li abundance than those with turbulence. Lower red giant branch stars instead favor the models with turbulence. Larger differences between models with mass loss and those with turbulence appear in the interior concentrations of metals. The relatively high mass loss rates required to reproduce plateau-like lithium abundances appear unlikely when compared to the solar mass-loss rate. However the presence of a chromosphere on these stars justifies further investigation of the mass-loss rates. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Karczmarek;  We performed a new and accurate fit of light and radial velocity curves of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) Cepheid --OGLE-LMC-CEP-0227-- belonging to a detached double-lined eclipsing binary system. We computed several sets of nonlinear, convective models covering a broad range in stellar mass, effective temperature and in chemical composition. The comparison between theory and observations indicates that current theoretical framework accounts for luminosity --V and I band-- and radial velocity variations over the entire pulsation cycle. Predicted pulsation mass --M=4.14+-0.06 Mo-- and mean effective temperature --Te=6100+-50 K-- do agree with observed estimates with an accuracy better than 1 sigma. The same outcome applies, on average, to the luminosity amplitudes and to the mean radius. We find that the best fit solution requires a chemical composition that is more metal--poor than typical LMC Cepheids (Z=0.004 vs 0.008) and slightly helium enhanced (Y=0.27 vs 0.25), but the sensitivity to He abundance is quite limited. Finally, the best fit model reddening --E(V-I)=0.171+-0.015 mag-- and the true distance modulus corrected for the barycenter of the LMC --mu_{0,LMC}=18.50+-0.02+-0.10 (syst) mag--, agree quite well with similar estimates in the recent literature. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Drake (1,2) ((1) Observatório Nacional, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil, (2) Sobolev Astronomical Institute, St. Petersburg State University, St. Petersburg, Russia);"  Context: Open clusters are very useful targets for examining possible trends in galactocentric distance and age, especially when young and old open clusters are compared. Aims: We carried out a detailed spectroscopic analysis to derive the chemical composition of seven red giants in the young open cluster NGC 3114. Abundances of C, N, O, Li, Na, Mg, Al, Ca, Si, Ti, Ni, Cr, Y, Zr, La, Ce, and Nd were obtained, as well as the carbon isotopic ratio. Methods: The atmospheric parameters of the studied stars and their chemical abundances were determined using high-resolution optical spectroscopy. We employed the local-thermodynamic-equilibrium model atmospheres of Kurucz and the spectral analysis code MOOG. The abundances of the light elements were derived using the spectral synthesis technique. Results: We found that NGC 3114 has a mean metallicity of [Fe/H] = -0.01+/-0.03. The isochrone fit yielded a turn-off mass of 4.2 Msun. The [N/C] ratio is in good agreement with the models predicted by first dredge-up. We found that two stars, HD 87479 and HD 304864, have high rotational velocities of 15.0 km/s and 11.0 km/s; HD 87526 is a halo star and is not a member of NGC 3114. Conclusions: The carbon and nitrogen abundance in NGC 3114 agree with the field and cluster giants. The oxygen abundance in NGC 3114 is lower compared to the field giants. The [O/Fe] ratio is similar to the giants in young clusters. We detected sodium enrichment in the analyzed cluster giants. As far as the other elements are concerned, their [X/Fe] ratios follow the same trend seen in giants with the same metallicity. ";Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.1050;Molybdenum, Ruthenium, and the Heavy r-process Elements in Moderately  Metal-Poor Main-Sequence Turnoff Stars; Ruth C. Peterson;  The ratios of elemental abundances observed in metal-poor stars of the Galactic halo provide a unique present-day record of the nucleosynthesis products of its earliest stars. While the heaviest elements were synthesized by the r- and s-processes, dominant production mechanisms of light trans-ironic elements were obscure until recently. This work investigates further our 2011 conclusion that the low-entropy regime of a high-entropy wind (HEW) produced molybdenum and ruthenium in two moderately metal-poor turnoff stars that showed extreme overabundances of those elements with respect to iron. Only a few, rare nucleosynthesis events may have been involved. Here we determine abundances for Mo, Ru, and other trans-Fe elements for 28 similar stars by matching spectral calculations to well-exposed near-UV Keck HIRES spectra obtained for beryllium abundances. In each of the 26 turnoff stars with Mo or Ru line detections and no evidence for s-process production (therefore old), we find Mo and Ru to be three to six times overabundant. In contrast, the maximum overabundance is reduced to factors of three and two for the neighboring elements zirconium and palladium. Since the overproduction peaks sharply at Mo and Ru, a low-entropy HEW is confirmed as its origin. The overabundance level of the heavy r-process elements varies significantly, from none to a factor of four, but is uncorrelated with Mo and Ru overabundances. Despite their moderate metallicity, stars in this group trace the products of different nucleosynthetic events: possibly very few events, possibly events whose output depended on environment, metallicity, or time. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)"

Teixeira,  Wolfgang Brandner,  Wilhelm Kley,  Hans Zinnecker;  This study aims to determine the impact of stellar binary companions on the lifetime and evolution of circumstellar disks in the Chamaeleon I (Cha I) star-forming region by measuring the frequency and strength of accretion and circumstellar dust signatures around the individual components of T Tauri binary stars. We used high-angular resolution adaptive optics JHKL'-band photometry and 1.5-2.5mu spectroscopy of 19 visual binary and 7 triple stars in Cha I - including one newly discovered tertiary component - with separations between ~25 and ~1000au. The data allowed us to infer stellar component masses and ages and, from the detection of near-infrared excess emission and the strength of Brackett-gamma emission, the presence of ongoing accretion and hot circumstellar dust of the individual stellar component of each binary. Of all the stellar components in close binaries with separations of 25-100au, 10(+15-5)% show signs of accretion. This is less than half of the accretor fraction found in wider binaries, which itself appears significantly reduced (~44%) compared with previous measurements of single stars in Cha I. Hot dust was found around 50(+30-15)% of the target components, a value that is indistinguishable from that of Cha I single stars. Only the closest binaries (<25au) were inferred to have a significantly reduced fraction (<~25%) of components that harbor hot dust. Accretors were exclusively found in binary systems with unequal component masses M_secondary/M_primary < 0.8, implying that the detected accelerated disk dispersal is a function of mass-ratio. This agrees with the finding that only one accreting secondary star was found, which is also the weakest accretor in the sample. The results imply that disk dispersal is more accelerated the stronger the dynamical disk truncation, i.e., the smaller the inferred radius of the disk.

Rubele;"  Context: The details of how galaxies have evolved are imprinted in their star formation history, chemical enrichment and morpho-kinematic structure. Parameters behind these can be measured by combining photometric techniques with modelling. However, there are uncertainties from the ambiguity of colour and magnitude and the effects of interstellar reddening. Aims: In this paper we present a detailed reddening map of the central 30 Doradus region of the Large Magellanic Cloud; for community use and to test the methods used. The reddening, a measurement of dust extinction, acts as a tracer of the interstellar medium (ISM). Methods: Near infrared photometry of red clump stars are used to measure reddening as extinction is the main cause of their colour and magnitude variance. The star formation history is used to convert colour to reddening values which are subsequently converted to visual extinction. Results: Presented is a dust map for the 30 Doradus field. This map samples a region of 1x1.5 deg, containing ~1.5x10^5 red clump stars which probe reddening up to AV=6 mag. We compare our map with maps from the literature, including optical extinction maps and radio, mid- and far-infrared maps of atomic hydrogen and dust emission. Through estimation of column density we locate molecular clouds. Conclusions: This new reddening map shows correlation with equivalent maps in the literature, validating the method of red clump star selection. We make our reddening map available for community use. In terms of ISM the red clump stars appear to be more affected by the cooler dust measured by 70 micron emission because there is stronger correlation between increasing emission and extinction due to red clump stars not being located near hot stars that would heat the dust. The transition from atomic hydrogen to molecular hydrogen occurs between densities of NH=4x10^21 to 6x10^21 cm^-2. ";Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

KOI-256 is listed as hosting a transiting planet-candidate by Borucki et al. and Batalha et al.; here we report that the planet-candidate transit signal is in fact the occultation of a white dwarf as it passes behind the M dwarf. We combine publicly-available long- and short-cadence Kepler light curves with ground-based measurements to robustly determine the system parameters. The occultation events are readily apparent in the Kepler light curve, as is spin-orbit synchronization of the M dwarf, and we detect the transit of the white dwarf in front of the M dwarf halfway between the occultation events. The size of the white dwarf with respect to the Einstein ring during transit (REin = 0.00473 +/- 0.00055 RSun) causes the transit depth to be shallower than expected from pure geometry due to gravitational lensing. KOI-256 is an old, long-period ePCEB and serves as a benchmark object for studying the evolution of binary star systems as well as white dwarfs themselves, thanks largely to the availability of near-continuous, ultra-precise Kepler photometry.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.1249;The global solar magnetic field -- identification of travelling,  long-lived ripples; Roger K. Ulrich,  Tham Tran;  We have examined the global structure of the solar magnetic field using data from the FeI spectral line at {\lambda}5250.2{\AA} obtained at the 150-foot tower telescope at the Mt. Wilson Observatory (MWO). For each point on the solar surface, we find the value of the magnetic field in the meridional plane, Bm, by averaging over all available observations using a cosine weighting method. We have revised our cosine weighting method by now taking into account more fully the highest latitude geometry. We use the annual variation in the latitude of the disk center, b0, to deduce the tilt angle of the field relative to the local vertical so that we can find the radial component of the field, Br from Bm. We find this tilt angle to be small except for a near-polar zone where a tilt-angle model can reduce the annual variation. The reduced annual variation in the deduced Br allows us to study dBr/dt and associated deviations in Br from a smoothed Br with a smoothing width of 2.5 years. These functions make evident the presence of small amplitude (3 to 5 gauss) but spatially coherent ripples with a semi-regular periodicity of 1 to 3 years. At any given time the half-wavelength (peak-to-trough) is between 15 and 30 degrees of latitude. These patterns are ubiquitous and in many cases drift from near the equator to the poles over a time period of roughly 2 years. The drift rate pattern is not compatible with simple advection. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.1252;Effects of Penetrative Convection on Solar Dynamo; Youhei Masada,  Kohei Yamada,  Akira Kageyama;  Spherical solar dynamo simulations are performed. Self-consistent, fully compressible magnetohydrodynamic system with a stably stratified layer below the convective envelope is numerically solved with a newly developed simulation code based on the Yin-Yang grid. The effects of penetrative convection are studied by comparing two models with and without the stable layer. The differential rotation profile in both models is reasonably solar-like with equatorial acceleration. When considering the penetrative convection, a tachocline-like shear layer is developed and maintained beneath the convection zone without assuming any forcing. While turbulent magnetic field becomes predominant in the region where the convective motion is vigorous, mean-field component is preferentially organized in the region where the convective motion is less vigorous. Especially in the stable layer, the strong large-scale field with a dipole symmetry is spontaneously built up. The polarity reversal of the mean-field component takes place globally and synchronously throughout the system regardless the presence of the stable layer. Our results suggest that the stably stratified layer is a key component for organizing the large-scale strong magnetic field, but is not essential for the polarity reversal. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

We find a trend in the relation between radii and Teff; the radius is at a minimum at Teff~1600 K, which corresponds to the spectral types of mid-to late-L.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.1362;Formation of chondrules in radiative shock waves I. First results,  spherical dust particles, stationary shocks; H. Joham,  E.A. Dorfi;  The formation of chondrules in the protoplanetary nebulae causes many questions concerning the formation process, the source of energy for melting the rims, and the composition of the origin material. The aim of this work is to explore the heating of the chondrule in a single precursor as is typical for radiation hydrodynamical shock waves. We take into account the gas-particle friction for the duration of the shock transition and calculate the heat conduction into the chondrules. These processes are located in the protoplanetary nebulae at a region around 2.5 AU, which is considered to be the most likely place of chondrule formation. The present models are a first step towards computing radiative shock waves occurring in a particle-rich environment. We calculated the shock waves using one-dimensional, time-independent equations of radiation hydrodynamics involving realistic gas and dust opacities and gas-particle friction. The evolution of spherical chondrules was followed by solving the heat conduction equation on an adaptive grid. The results for the shock-heating event are consistent with the cosmochemical constraints of chondrule properties. The calculations yield a relative narrow range for density or temperature to meet the requested heating rates of $R > 10^4\,K\, h^{-1}$ as extracted from cosmochemical constraints. Molecular gas, opacities with dust, and a protoplanetary nebula with accretion are necessary requirements for a fast heating process. The thermal structure in the far post-shock region is not fully consistent with experimental constraints on chondrule formation since the models do not include additional molecular cooling processes. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

In the cases of logarithmic and square root laws of limb darkening the flux and its derivatives were expressed in terms of integrals which can be efficiently computed using Gaussian quadrature formula, taking into account singularities of the integrand. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.1464;Effect of Metallicity on the Evolution of the Habitable Zone from the  Pre-Main Sequence to the Asymptotic Giant Branch and the Search for Life; William C. Danchi,  Bruno Lopez;  During the course of stellar evolution, the location and width of the habitable zone changes as the luminosity and radius of the star evolves. The duration of habitability for a planet located at a given distance from a star is greatly affected by the characteristics of the host star. A quantification of these effects can be used observationally in the search for life around nearby stars. The longer the duration of habitability, the more likely it is that life has evolved. The preparation of observational techniques aimed at detecting life would benefit from the scientific requirements deduced from the evolution of the habitable zone. We present a study of the evolution of the habitable zone around stars of 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 M$_{\odot}$ for metallicities ranging from Z=0.0001 to Z=0.070. We also consider the evolution of the habitable zone from the pre-main sequence until the asymptotic giant branch is reached. We find that metallicity strongly affects the duration of the habitable zone for a planet as well as the distance from the host star where the duration is maximized. For a 1.0 M$_{\odot}$ star with near Solar metallicity, Z=0.017, the duration of the habitable zone is $>$10 Gyr at distances 1.2 to 2.0 AU from the star, whereas the duration is $>$20 Gyr for high metallicity stars (Z=0.070) at distances of 0.7 to 1.8 AU, and $\sim$4 Gyr at distances of 1.8 to 3.3 AU for low metallicity stars (Z=0.0001).

We report here that in 2011 it suddenly faded away, becoming 2 magnitudes fainter in the V-band, and has remained in this deep state since then. We report new optical and near-IR photometry and spectroscopy obtained during the fading event. The system appears much redder and fainter than it was in the bright state. Also, the 8.2d photometric period continuously observed for more than 20 years is not seen during most of the deep state. The analysis of the system's brightness and colors suggests that the visual extinction on the line of sight has increased by about 3-4 magnitudes in the deep state. At optical wavelengths, the system appears to be dominated by scattered light, probably originating from the upper surface layers of a highly inclined circumstellar disk. The profiles of the Balmer lines have significantly changed as well, with the disappearance of a central absorption component regularly observed in the bright state. We ascribe this change to the scattering of the system's spectrum by circumstellar dust. Noticeably, the mass accretion rate in the inner disk and onto the central star has not changed as the system faded away. We conclude that the deepening of the AA Tau system is due to a sudden increase of circumstellar dust extinction on the line of sight without concomitant change in the accretion rate. We suggest that the enhanced obscuration may be produced by a non-axisymmetric overdense region in the disk, located at a distance of 7.7 AU or more, that was recently brought on the line of sight by its keplerian motion around the central star. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Predictable patterns in frequency spacings are seen in the Fourier transform of the light curve. We present an analysis of 180 d of short-cadence Kepler photometry and of new spectroscopic data for this evolved, late A-type star. We infer from the 1150-d, long-cadence light curve, and in two different ways, that our target is the primary of a 343-d, non-eclipsing binary system. According to both methods, the mass function is similar, f(M)=0.0207 +/- 0.0003 Msun. The observed pulsations are modelled extensively, using separate, state-of-the-art, time-dependent convection (TDC) and rotating models. The models match the observed temperature and low metallicity, finding a mass of 1.50-1.56 Msun. The models suggest the whole star is metal-poor, and that the low metallicity is not just a surface abundance peculiarity. This is the best frequency analysis of an SX Phe star, and the only Kepler \delta\ Sct star to be modelled with both TDC and rotating models. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

We obtained six-telescope interferometric observations with the CHARA Array and the MIRC beam combiner. These show that the spatial flux distribution is larger than expected for the stellar photosphere. A two component model for the star (uniform disk) plus a halo (two-dimensional Gaussian) yields an excellent fit of the observations, and we suggest that the halo corresponds to flux emitted from the base of the stellar wind. This wind component contributes about 45% of the H-band flux and has an angular FWHM = 0.96 mas, compared to the predicted stellar diameter of 0.41 mas. We show several images reconstructed from the interferometric visibilities and closure phases, and they indicate a generally spherical geometry for the wind. We also obtained near-infrared spectrophotometry of P Cygni from which we derive the flux excess compared to a purely photospheric spectral energy distribution. The H-band flux excess matches that from the wind flux fraction derived from the two component fits to the interferometry. We find evidence of significant near-infrared flux variability over the period from 2006 to 2010 that appears similar to the variations in the H-alpha emission flux from the wind. Future interferometric observations may be capable of recording the spatial variations associated with temporal changes in the wind structure. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Ghez,  Hans Zinnecker;"  We have made the first detection of a near-infrared counterpart associated with the disk around Radio Source ""I,"" a massive protostar in the Kleinmann-Low Nebula in Orion using imaging with laser guide star adaptive optics on the Keck II telescope. The infrared emission is evident in images acquired using L' (3.8 microns) and Ms (4.7 microns) filters and is not detectable at K' (2.1 microns). The observed morphology strongly suggests that we are seeing some combination of scattered and thermal light emanating from the disk. The disk is also manifest in the L'/Ms flux ratio image. We interpret the near-infrared emission as the illuminated surface of a nearly edge-on disk, oriented so that only the northern face is visible; the opposite surface remains hidden by the disk. We do not see infrared radiation associated directly with the star proposed to be associated with Source ""I."" The data also suggest that there is a cavity above and below the disk that is oriented perpendicular to the disk, and is sculpted by the known, strong outflow from the inner disk of Source I. We compare our data to models of a protostar with a surrounding disk, envelope, and wind-blown cavity in order to elucidate the nature of the disk around Radio Source I.

Poleski,  M.K. Szymanski,  M. Kubiak,  G. Pietrzynski,  S. Kozlowski,  P. Pietrukowicz,  K. Ulaczyk,  L. Wyrzykowski;  OGLE-2002-BLG-360 was discovered as a microlensing candidate by the OGLE-III project. The subsequent light curve however clearly showed that the brightening of the object could not have resulted from the gravitational microlensing phenomenon. We aim to explain the nature of OGLE-2002-BLG-360 and its eruption observed in 2002--2006. The observational data primarily come from the archives of the OGLE project, which monitored the object in 2001--2009. The archives of the MACHO and MOA projects also provided us with additional data obtained in 1995--99 and 2000--2005, respectively. These data allowed us to analyse the light curve of the object during its eruption, as well as the potential variability of its progenitor. In the archives of several infrared surveys, namely 2MASS, MSX, Spitzer, AKARI, WISE, and VVV, we found measurements of the object, which allowed us to study the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the object. We constructed a simple model of a star surrounded by a dusty envelope, which was used to interpret the observed SED. Our analysis of the data clearly shows that OGLE-2002-BLG-360 was most probably a red transient, i.e. an object similar in nature to V838 Mon, whose eruption was observed in 2002. The SED in all phases, i.e. progenitor, eruption, and remnant, was dominated by infrared emission, which we interpret as evidence of dust formation in an intense mass outflow. Since 2009 the object has been completely embedded in dust. We suggest that the progenitor of OGLE-2002-BLG-360 was a binary, which had entered the common-envelope phase a long time (at least decades) before the observed eruption, and that the eruption resulted from the final merger of the binary components. We point out similarities between OGLE-2002-BLG-360 and CK Vul, whose eruption was observed in 1670--72, and this strengthens the hypothesis that CK Vul was also a red transient. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.1717;Optical constants of refractory oxides at high temperatures; Simon Zeidler,  Thomas Posch,  Harald Mutschke;  Many cosmic dust species, among them refractory oxides, form at temperatures higher than 300 K. Nevertheless, most astrophysical studies are based on the room-temperature optical constants of solids, such as corundum and spinel. A more realistic approach is needed for these materials, especially in the context of modeling late-type stars. We aimed at deriving sets of optical constants of selected, astrophysically relevant oxide dust species with high melting points. A high-temperature-high-pressure-cell and a Fourier-transform spectrometer were used to measure reflectance spectra of polished samples. For corundum (alpha-Al$_2$O$_3$), spinel (MgAl$_2$O$_4$), and alpha-quartz (SiO$_2$), temperature-dependent optical constants were measured from 300 K up to more than 900 K. Small particle spectra were also calculated from these data. All three examined oxides show a significant temperature dependence of their mid-IR bands. For the case of corundum, we find that the 13$\mu$m emission feature - seen in the IR spectra of many AGB stars - can very well be assigned to this mineral species. The best fit of the feature is achieved with oblate corundum grains at mean temperatures around 550 K. Spinel remains a viable carrier of the 13$\mu$m feature as well, but only for T < 300 K and nearly spherical grain shapes. Under such circumstances, spinel grains may also account for the 31.8$\mu$m band that is frequently seen in sources of the 13$\mu$m feature and which has not yet been identified with certainty. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

The amplitude of the outburst was about 8 mag. We performed simultaneous multi-color photometry by using g', Rc, and i'-band filters from the early stage of the outburst. The time resolved photometry during the early stage revealed periodic variations with double-peaked profiles, which are referred to as early superhumps, with amplitudes of about 0.08 mag. After the rapid fading from the main outburst, we found rebrightening phenomena, which occurred at least nine times. The large amplitude of the outburst, early superhumps, and rebrightening phenomena are typical features of WZ Sge-type dwarf novae. We detected color variations within the early superhump modulations making this only the second system, after V445 And, for which this has been established. We carried out numerical calculations of the accretion disk to explain both of the modulations and the color variations of the early superhump. This modeling of the disk height supports the idea that height variations within the outer disk can produce the early superhump modulations, though we cannot rule out that temperature asymmetries may also play a role. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.1921;Coronal loop physical parameters from the analysis of multiple observed  transverse oscillations; A. Asensio Ramos,  I. Arregui (IAC);  The analysis of quickly damped transverse oscillations of solar coronal loops using magneto-hydrodynamic seismology allow us to infer physical parameters that are difficult to measure otherwise. Under the assumption that such damped oscillations are due to the resonant conversion of global modes into Alfven oscillations of the tube surface, we carry out a global seismological analysis of a large set of coronal loops. A Bayesian hierarchical method is used to obtain distributions for coronal loop physical parameters by means of a global analysis of a large number of observations. The resulting distributions summarise global information and constitute data-favoured information that can be used for the inversion of individual events. The results strongly suggest that internal Alfven travel times along the loop are larger than 100 s and smaller than 540 s with 95% probability. Likewise, the density contrast between the loop interior and the surrounding is larger than 2.3 and below 6.9 with 95% probability. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.1925;Observation of flux tube crossings in the solar wind; L. Arnold,  G. Li,  X. Li,  Y. Yan;  Current sheets are ubiquitous in the solar wind.They are a major source of the solar wind MHD turbulence intermittency. They may result from non-linear interactions of the solar wind MHD turbulence or are the boundaries of flux tubes that originate from the solar surface. Some current sheets appear in pairs and are the boundaries of transient structures such as magnetic holes and reconnection exhausts, or the edges of pulsed Alfv\'{e}n waves. For an individual current sheet, discerning whether it is a flux tube boundary or due to non-linear interactions, or the boundary of a transient structure is difficult. In this work, using data from the {\sl Wind} spacecraft, we identify two three-current-sheet events. Detailed examination of these two events suggest that they are best explained by the flux tube crossing scenario. Our study provides a convincing evidence supporting the scenario that the solar wind consists of flux tubes where distinct plasmas reside. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Space Physics (physics.space-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.1938;Transfer of Energy, Potential, and Current by Alfvén Waves in Solar  Flares; D.B. Melrose,  M.S. Wheatland;"  Alfv\'en waves play three related roles in the impulsive phase of a solar flare: they transport energy from a generator region to an acceleration region; they map the cross-field potential (associated with the driven energy release) from the generator region onto the acceleration region; and within the acceleration region they damp by setting up a parallel electric field that accelerates electrons and transfers the wave energy to them. The Alfv\'en waves may also be regarded as setting up new closed current loops, with field-aligned currents that close across field lines at boundaries. A model is developed for large-amplitude Alfv\'en waves that shows how Alfv\'en waves play these roles in solar flares. A picket-fence structure for the current flow is incorporated into the model to account for the ""number problem"" and the energy of the accelerated electrons.

We use observations taken on board the two STEREO spacecraft during the unusually long minimum of Solar Cycle 23 from January 2007 through December 2010. During this period instruments on STEREO observed more than 50 CIR events making it possible to investigate CIR ion abundances during solar minimum conditions with unprecedentedly high statistics. The observations reveal annual variations of relative ion abundances in the CIRs during the 2007 - 2008 period. In 2010 the elemental composition in CIRs were influenced by solar energetic particle events. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.2027;A unified normal mode approach to dynamic tides and its application to  rotating Sun-like stars; P. B. Ivanov,  J. C. B. Papaloizou,  S. V. Chernov;  We determine the response of a uniformly rotating star to tidal perturbations due to a companion. General periodic orbits and parabolic flybys are considered. We evaluate energy and angular momentum exchange rates as a sum of contributions from normal modes allowing for dissipative processes. We consider the case when the response is dominated by the contribution of an identifiable regular spectrum of low frequency modes, such as gravity modes and evaluate it in the limit of very weak dissipation. Our formalism may be applied both to Sun-like stars with radiative cores and convective envelopes and to more massive stars with convective cores and radiative envelopes. We provide general expressions for transfer of energy and angular momentum valid for an orbit with any eccentricity. Detailed calculations are made for Sun-like stars in the slow rotation regime where centrifugal distortion is neglected in the equilibrium and the traditional approximation is made for the normal modes. We use both a WKBJ procedure and direct numerical evaluation which are found to be in good agreement for regimes of interest. Finally we use our formalism to determine the evolution time scales for an object, in an orbit of small eccentricity, around a Sun-like star in which the tidal response is assumed to occur. Systems with either no rotation or synchronous rotation are considered. Only rotationally modified gravity modes are taken into account under the assumption that wave dissipation occurs close to the stellar centre. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)"

The relative distances are independent of uncertainties affecting the zero-point of the PW relations, but do depend on the adopted pivot periods. We estimated the pivot periods for fundamental (FU) and first overtone (FO) Cepheids on the basis of their period distributions. We found that log P=0.5 (FU) and log P=0.3 (FO) are solid choices, since they trace a main peak and a shoulder in LMC and SMC period distributions. By using the above pivot periods and ten PW relations, we found MC relative distances of 0.53$\pm$0.06 (FU) and 0.53$\pm$0.07 (FO) mag. Moreover, we investigated the possibility to use mixed-mode (FU/FO, FO/SO) Cepheids as distance indicators and we found that they follow quite well the PW relations defined by single mode MC Cepheids, with deviations typically smaller than 0.3{\sigma}. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.2157;On the origin of orbital period change in WY Cancri: a genuine angular  momentum loss?; Wen-Cong Chen;  WY Cancri is a short-period ($P$=0.829 d) eclipsing RS Canum Venaticorum stars, and both components are late-type stars. Recently, observations provided by photometric observations and light time minima show that the orbital period of WY Cancri is experiencing a secular decrease at a rate of ${\rm d} P/{\rm d}t=-1.2\times10^{-7}\rm d yr^{-1}$. In this Letter, we attempt to investigate if the period change of WY Cancri can originate from the angular momentum loss. In calculation, we assume that this source has a high wind loss rate of $\sim10^{-10} \rm M_{\odot} yr^{-1}$. To account for the observation, magnetic braking demands a strong surface magnetic field of $\gtrsim 10000$ G like Ap/Bp stars. Furthermore, if this source may be surrounded by a circumbinary disk, and 6% of the wind loss feeds the disk, tidal torque between the disk and the binary can offer the observed angular momentum loss rate. Such a strong magnetic field or an extremely high wind input fraction seem to be highly unlikely. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.2165;Could strange stars be in the color-flavor-locked phase: Tested by their  thermal evolutions; Quan Cheng,  Yun-Wei Yu,  Xiao-Ping Zheng;  The thermal evolution of strange stars in both normal and color-flavor-locked (CFL) phases are investigated together with the evolutions of the stellar rotation and the r-mode instability. The heating effects due to the deconfinement transition of the stellar crust and the dissipation of the r-modes are considered. As a result, the cooling of the stars in the normal phase is found to be not very different from the standard one. In contrast, for the stars in the CFL phase, a big bump during the first hundred years and a steep decay ($\sim$7% in ten years) at the ages of $\sim10^{4-6}$ yrs are predicted in their thermal evolution curves. These unique features provide an effective observational test for determining whether or not the CFL phase is reached in strange stars. This thermal test method is independent of and complementary to the rotational test method, which is a direct consequence of the r-mode instability. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)"

Our study extends this sample with two spectroscopic binary systems. AIMS. Our goal is to provide orbital solutions, fundamental parameters and abundances from disentangled high-resolution high signal-to-noise spectra, as well as to analyse and interpret the variations in the Kepler light curve of these carefully selected targets. This way we continue our efforts to map the instability strips of beta Cep and SPB stars using the combination of high-resolution ground-based spectroscopy and uninterrupted space-based photometry. Methods: We fit Keplerian orbits to radial velocities measured from selected absorption lines of high-resolution spectroscopy using synthetic composite spectra to obtain orbital solutions. We use revised masks to obtain optimal light curves from the original pixel-data from the Kepler satellite, which provided better long term stability compared to the pipeline processed light curves. We use various time-series analysis tools to explore and describe the nature of variations present in the light curve. Results: We find two eccentric double-lined spectroscopic binary systems containing a total of three main sequence B-type stars (and one F-type component) of which at least one in each system exhibits light variations. The light curve analysis (combined with spectroscopy) of the system of two B stars points towards the presence of tidally excited g modes in the primary component. We interpret the variations seen in the second system as classical g mode pulsations driven by the kappa mechanism in the B type primary, and explain the unexpected power in the p mode region as a result of nonlinear resonant mode excitation. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

We determined six frequencies as normal modes and four rotational doublets around the ones having the largest amplitude. Two normal modes at 807.62 and 861.56 microHz have never been reported before. A rigorous test revealed remarkable intrinsic amplitude variability of frequencies at 839.14 and 861.56 microHz over a 50 d time-scale. In addition, the multimode pulsation changed to monoperiodic pulsation with an 843.15 microHz dominant frequency at the end of the observing run. The 2.76 microHz average rotational split detected led to a determination of a 2.1 d rotational period for GD 154. We searched for model solutions with effective temperatures and log g close to the spectroscopically determined ones. The best-fitting models resulting from the grid search have M_H between 6.3 x 10^-5 and 6.3 x 10^-7 M*, which means thicker hydrogen layer than the previous studies suggested.

The hydrodynamic models of such a system were calculated by SPH method. It was shown the distortions in the disk, caused by the orbital motion of the companion, lead to the strong dependence of illumination conditions of the disk on the azimuth (because of extinction between the star and the disk surface) and, therefore, it leads to the appearance of large-scale asymmetry in images of disks. The calculations showed the dependence of the illumination on the azimuth was stronger in the central part of the disk than on the periphery. Bright and dark domains are located not symmetry with respect to the line of nodes. The sizes and locations of the domains are depended on the model parameters as well as on the phase of the orbital period. The bright and dark domains do not follow the companion, but they make small amplitude oscillations with respect to some direction. The properties of the model, which were written above, open new opportunities of searching low-mass companions in the vicinity of young stars. The stars with protoplanetary disks, which are observed face-on or under the small inclination angle i, are the best ones for this purpose. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

De Pontieu,  E. Scullion;  Recently, it was shown that the complex dynamical behaviour of spicules has to be interpreted as the result of simultaneous action of three kinds of motion: (1) field aligned flows, (2) swaying motions, and (3) torsional motions. We use high-quality observations from CRISP at the SST to investigate signs of these different kinetic modes in spicules on the disk. Earlier, rapid blue-shifted excursions (RBEs), short-lived absorption features in the blue wing of chromospheric spectral lines, were identified as the disk counterpart of type II spicules. Here we report the existence of similar absorption features in the red wing of the Ca II 8542 and Halpha lines: rapid red-shifted excursions (RREs). RREs are found over the whole solar disk and are located in the same regions as RBEs: in the vicinity of magnetic field concentrations. RREs have similar characteristics as RBEs: they have similar lengths, widths, lifetimes, and average Doppler velocity. The striking similarity of RREs to RBEs implies that RREs are a manifestation of the same physical phenomenon and that spicules harbour motions that can result in a net red-shift when observed on-disk. We find that RREs are less abundant than RBEs and we interpret the higher number of RBEs and the decreased imbalance towards the limb as an indication that field-aligned up-flows have a significant contribution to the net Dopplershift. Most RREs and RBEs are observed in isolation but we find many examples of parallel and touching RRE/RBE pairs which appear to be part of the same spicule. We interpret the existence of these RRE/RBE pairs as signs that torsional motion is an important characteristic of spicules. The fact that most RBEs and RREs are observed in isolation agrees with the idea that transversal swaying motion is another important kinetic mode. We find examples of transitions from RRE to RBE and vice versa. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.2317;Local Radiation-Driven Instabilities in Post-Main Sequence Massive Stars; Andrés Suárez-Madrigal,  Mark Krumholz,  Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz;  Late in their evolution, massive stars may undergo periods of violent instability and mass loss, but the mechanism responsible for these episodes has not been identified. We study one potential contributor: the development of local radiation-driven instabilities in the outer layers of main sequence (MS) and post-MS massive stars. We construct a sequence of massive stellar evolution models and investigate where they are subject to local radiative instabilities, both in the presence of magnetic fields and without them,and at a range of metallicities. We find that these types of instabilities do not occur in solar-metallicity MS stars up to 100\,M$_\odot$, but they set in immediately post-MS for stars heavier than $\sim 25$\,M$_\odot$. Once an instability appears, it involves a significant amount of mass in the star's upper layers (up to $\sim 1$ per cent of the initial stellar mass), suggesting that radiation-driven instabilities are a potentially viable mechanism for dynamic mass loss. We find that the presence of magnetic fields at strengths low enough not to disturb the hydrostatic balance of the star does not alter these results. Stars with sub-Solar metallicity also show instability, but their instabilities involve less mass and appear later in the star's evolution. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

However, no evidence is found for any abrupt centrifugal breakout of plasma from the magnetosphere, either in the residual flux or in the depths of the light minima. Motivated by this finding we compare the observationally inferred magnetospheric mass against that predicted by a breakout analysis. The large discrepancy between the values leads us to argue that centrifugal breakout does not play a significant role in establishing the magnetospheric mass budget of sigma Ori E. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Starspots, accretion, stellar companions, and disk veiling can contribute to the photometric variability of YSOs. As part of an ongoing study of the Rho Oph star forming region, we report the discovery of 92.6 day periodic variations for the Class I YSO YLW 16A, observed over a period of three years. A SED model was fit to available photometric data for the object. We propose a triple-system with an inner binary with a period of 93 days eclipsed by a warped circum-binary disk. The nature of the secondary is unconstrained and could be stellar or sub-stellar. We report the discovery of a tertiary companion at a projected separation of ~40 AU that could account for the circum-binary disk warp. This light curve and model is similar to the model we proposed for WL 4 in previous work. Understanding these systems may lead to insights about the nature of stellar evolution and planetary formation, and provide valuable benchmarks for future theoretical modeling and near- and mid-infrared synoptic surveys of YSOs. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.2440;The origin of the helicity hemispheric sign rule reversals in the  mean-field solar-type dynamo; V.V. Pipin,  H. Zhang,  D.D. Sokoloff,  K.M. Kuzanyan,  Y. Gao;  Observations of proxies of the magnetic helicity in the Sun over the past two solar cycles revealed reversals of the helicity hemispheric sign rule (negative in the North and positive in the South hemispheres). We apply the mean-field solar dynamo model to study the reversals of the magnetic helicity sign for the dynamo operating in the bulk of the solar convection zone. The evolution of the magnetic helicity is governed by the conservation law. We found that the reversal of the sign of the small-scale magnetic helicity follows the dynamo wave propagating inside the convection zone. Therefore, the spatial patterns of the magnetic helicity reversals reflect the processes which contribute to generation and evolution of the large-scale magnetic fields. At the surface the patterns of the helicity sign reversals are determined by the magnetic helicity boundary conditions at the top of the convection zone. We demonstrate the impact of fluctuations in the dynamo parameters and variability in dynamo cycle amplitude on the reversals of the magnetic helicity sign rule. The obtained results suggest that the magnetic helicity of the large-scale axisymmetric field can be treated as an additional observational tracer for the solar dynamo. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Sazonov;  \rm Observations of close binary system (CBS) V1357 Cyg=Cyg X-1 in the $WBVR$ bands are reported. Photometry was carried out at the telescopes located in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Crimea equipped with single-channel $WBVR$-photometer with photon counting. 1358 individual observations in $WBVR$ bands on 202 nights were obtained. The analysis of the photometric data allows to conclude that different photometric effects are superimposed on the orbital light curve of the system. Among them are brightness declines, outbursts with different duration and amplitude, chaotic variability, which sometimes exceeded the ellipsoidal variability. Strong brightness decreases with magnitude $0^m.035 - 0^m.045$ are observed, they are equal to the contribution of accretion disc to the total luminosity of the system. 10 years of photometric monitoring allowed to detect continous brightening of the system, followed by luminosity decline (slow outburst). After the maximum in 1994-96 the decline was equal to 7% in the $W$ band, 4% in the $V$ band, and 2% in the $V$ and $R$ bands. This paper continues the series of works on close systems with X-ray sources. \textbf{Key words}: Close binary systems - luminosity - ellipsoidal variability - accretion disc ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Sipahi;  New spectroscopic observations of the double-lined eclipsing binary AQ\,Cas are presented. All available spectroscopic and photometric observations have been analysed for the fundamental properties of the components. Analyses show that the system consists of a massive primary with a mass of 17.63$\pm$0.91 M$_{\odot}$ and radius of 13.48$\pm$0.64R$_{\odot}$ and a secondary with 12.56$\pm$0.81 M$_{\odot}$ and radius of 23.55$\pm$0.73 R$_{\odot}$, corresponding spectral types of B0.5($\pm$2) II-III + B3($\pm$1) II. The secondary star fills its corresponding Roche lobe and mass transfer to the primary star is going on. This stream considerably does affect the photometric observations both starting from the second quarter up to the first contact of primary eclipse and just at the second maximum. Thus, the light curve is distorted and tightly depended on the wavelength of the observations. The available multi passband light curves have been analysed by taking the stream effects, as either hot or cool spots, into account. The comparison of the models and observations in the $\log(L/L_{\odot})$ - $\log T_{eff}$ and $\log g - \log T_{eff}$ diagrams clearly shows that the more massive star is consistent with models and is predicted to be close to the phase of hydrogen shell ignition. Average distance to the system is estimated as 4150$\pm$240 pc using the BVJHK magnitudes and V-passband extinction. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

The relation of parameter Gn of the preceding and the following activity cycles has a long-term variation with the period of about 20 activity cycles. There is a positive correlation between the parameter Gn in the current cycle and analogous parameter in the following cycle Gn+1. For cycles N 10-21 for a pair of even and odd cycles the relation of parameter Gn corresponds to Gnevyshev-Ohl rule Godd/Geven>1. But in previous epochs the odd cycles could be less than the preceding even cycles, and it only proves the reversal of Gnevyshev-Ohl rule. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Mohamed,  S.E. de Mink;  Carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars count for 9-25% of all the very metal-poor stars of the halo. In at least some CEMP stars the chemical enrichment is believed to be due to wind mass transfer in the past from an AGB donor star on to a low-mass companion. However, binary population synthesis models predict much lower CEMP fractions. As an alternative to the canonical Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) wind accretion model, recent hydrodynamical simulations suggest an efficient mode of wind mass transfer, called wind Roche-lobe overflow (WRLOF), can reproduce observations of AGB winds in binary systems. We use our population synthesis model to test the consequences of WRLOF on a population of CEMP stars. Compared to previous predictions based on the BHL model we find a modest increase of the fraction of CEMP stars and substantial differences in the distributions of carbon and periods in the population of CEMP stars. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Costa,  C.A. de Souza,  D. Cieslinski,  G.R. Hickel;  The viewing geometry of the polar CP Tuc that better explains its optical and X-ray light curves is controversial. Previous modelling of white-light polarimetric data considered the partial self-eclipse of an extended inhomogeneous emitting region. Alternatively, phase-dependent absorption has been used to reproduce the X-ray data. This paper presents new optical polarimetric data of CP Tuc and a model that consistently explains its optical and X-ray data. The model was based on an extension of the CYCLOPS code that added X-ray bremsstrahlung emission and pre-shock region absorption to the original version, which only accounted for cyclotron emission. The new code creates the possibility of simultaneous optical and X-ray fitting. We show that self-eclipse and absorption data have distinct signatures on the X-ray spectra. Although we were able to reasonably fit the CP Tuc optical data to cases of absorption and self-eclipse, we were only able to reproduce the X-ray orbital modulation after considering the absorption in the pre-shock region. Specifically, we were unable to reproduce the X-ray observations in the self-eclipse case. We found that the primary emitting region in CP Tuc is located near the rotation pole that approximately points to the observer. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)"

Jura;"  Recently, some hot DA-type white dwarfs have been proposed to plausibly be escaping members of the Hyades. We used hydrogen Balmer lines to measure the radial velocities of seven such stars and confirm that three, and perhaps two others, are/were indeed cluster members and one is not. The other candidate Hyad is strongly magnetic and its membership status remains uncertain. The photospheres of at least one quarter of field white dwarf stars are ""polluted"" by elements heavier than helium that have been accreted. These stars are orbited by extended planetary systems that contain both debris belts and major planets. We surveyed the seven classical single Hyades white dwarfs and the newly identified (escaping) Hyades white dwarfs and found calcium in the photosphere of LP 475-242 of type DBA (now DBAZ), thus implying the presence of an orbiting planetary system. The spectrum of white dwarf GD 31, which may be, but probably is not, an escaping member of the Hyades, displays calcium absorption lines; these originate either from the interstellar medium or, less likely, from a gaseous circumstellar disk. If GD 31 was once a Hyades member, then it would be the first identified white dwarf Hyad with a cooling age >340 Myr. ";Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.2700;Phyllosilicate Emission from Protoplanetary Disks: Is the Indirect  Detection of Extrasolar Water Possible?; Melissa A. Morris,  Steven J. Desch;"  Phyllosilicates are hydrous minerals formed by interaction between rock and liquid water and are commonly found in meteorites originating in the asteroid belt. Collisions between asteroids contribute to zodiacal dust, which therefore reasonably could include phyllosilicates. Collisions between planetesimals in protoplanetary disks may also produce dust containing phyllosilicates. These minerals possess characteristic emission features in the mid-infrared and could be detectable in extrasolar protoplanetary disks. Here we determine whether phyllosilicates in protoplanetary disks are detectable in the infrared using instruments such as those on board the Spitzer Space Telescope and SOFIA (Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy). We calculate opacities for the phyllosilicates most common in meteorites and compute the emission of radiation from a protoplanetary disk using a 2-layer radiative transfer model. We find that phyllosilicates present at the 3% level lead to observationally significant differences in disk spectra, and should therefore be detectable using infrared observations and spectral modeling. Detection of phyllosilicates in a protoplanetary disk would be diagnostic of liquid water in planetesimals in that disk and would demonstrate similarity to our own Solar System. We also discuss use of phyllosilicate emission to test the ""waterworlds"" hypothesis, which proposes that liquid water in planetesimals should correlate with the inventory of short-lived radionuclides in planetary systems, especially 26Al.

Lovelace;  We present the results of axisymmetric simulations of MRI-driven accretion onto a rapidly rotating, magnetized star accreting in the propeller regime. The stellar magnetosphere corotates with the star, forming a centrifugal barrier at the disc-magnetosphere boundary which inhibits matter accretion onto the star. Instead, the disc matter accumulates at the disc-magnetosphere interface and slowly diffuses into the inner magnetosphere where it picks up angular momentum and is quickly ejected from the system as an outflow. Due to the interaction of the matter with the magnetosphere, this wind is discontinuous and is launched as discrete plasmoids. If the ejection rate is lower than the disc accretion rate, the matter accumulates at the disc-magnetosphere boundary faster than it can be ejected. In this case, accretion onto the star proceeds through the episodic accretion instability in which episodes of matter accumulation are followed by simultaneous accretion and ejection. During the accretion phase of this instability in which matter flows onto the star in funnel streams, we observe a corresponding rise in the outflow rate. Both the accretion and ejection processes observed in our simulations are highly non-stationary. The stars undergo strong spin-down due to the coupling of the stellar field with the disc and corona and we measure the spin-down timescales of around 1 Myr for a typical CTTS in the propeller regime. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)"

Monnier,  Nuria Calvet,  Catherine Espaillat,  Carol A. Grady,  Tim J. Harries,  Sebastian F. Hoenig,  Ray W. Russell,  Jeremy R. Swearingen,  Chelsea Werren,  David J. Wilner;  Pre-transitional disks are protoplanetary disks with a gapped disk structure, potentially indicating the presence of young planets in these systems. In order to explore the structure of these objects and their gap-opening mechanism, we observed the pre-transitional disk V1247 Orionis using the Very Large Telescope Interferometer, the Keck Interferometer, Keck-II, Gemini South, and IRTF. This allows us spatially resolve the AU-scale disk structure from near- to mid-infrared wavelengths (1.5 to 13 {\mu}m), tracing material at different temperatures and over a wide range of stellocentric radii. Our observations reveal a narrow, optically-thick inner-disk component (located at 0.18 AU from the star) that is separated from the optically thick outer disk (radii >46 AU), providing unambiguous evidence for the existence of a gap in this pre-transitional disk. Surprisingly, we find that the gap region is filled with significant amounts of optically thin material with a carbon-dominated dust mineralogy. The presence of this optically thin gap material cannot be deduced solely from the spectral energy distribution, yet it is the dominant contributor at mid-infrared wavelengths. Furthermore, using Keck/NIRC2 aperture masking observations in the H, K', and L' band, we detect asymmetries in the brightness distribution on scales of about 15-40 AU, i.e. within the gap region. The detected asymmetries are highly significant, yet their amplitude and direction changes with wavelength, which is not consistent with a companion interpretation but indicates an inhomogeneous distribution of the gap material. We interpret this as strong evidence for the presence of complex density structures, possibly reflecting the dynamical interaction of the disk material with sub-stellar mass bodies that are responsible for the gap clearing. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

In a slightly less massive target the presence of a convective core cannot be conclusively discarded, and thus its remaining main-sequence life time is uncertain. Our results reveal that best-fit models found solely by matching individual frequencies of oscillations corrected for surface effects do not always properly reproduce frequency combinations. Moreover, slightly different criteria to define what the best-fit model is can lead to solutions with similar global properties but very different interior structures. We argue that the use of frequency ratios is a more reliable way to obtain accurate stellar parameters, and show that our analysis in field main-sequence stars can yield an overall precision of 1.5%, 4%, and 10% in radius, mass and age, respectively. We compare our results with those obtained from global oscillation properties, and discuss the possible sources of uncertainties in asteroseismic stellar modeling where further studies are still needed. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.2775;The Dynamical Significance of Triple Star Systems in Star Clusters; Nathan W. C. Leigh,  Aaron M. Geller;  Over the last few decades, observational surveys have revealed that high-order multiple-star systems (e.g. triples, quadruples, etc.), and triples in particular, are common in our Galaxy. In this paper, we consider the dynamical significance of this transformation in our understanding of stellar multiplicity. Using empirically constrained binary and triple fractions in those star clusters for which these values are available in the literature, we compare analytic rates for encounters involving single, binary, and triple stars. Our results show that, \textit{even for relatively low triple fractions, dynamical interactions involving triples occur roughly as often as encounters involving either single or binary stars alone, particularly in low-mass star clusters}. More generally, using empirically-derived multiple star catalogues for the young star-forming association Taurus-Auriga and the Galactic field, we show that the data are consistent with the gravitationally-focused cross section for encounters increasing with increasing multiplicity. Consequently, triple stars, and even higher-order multiples, could be more important than previously realized for a number of astrophysical phenomena, including the formation and destruction of compact binaries and various types of stellar exotica, and the dynamical evolution of star clusters. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Hillebrandt;  Besides the fact that the gamma-ray emission due to radioactive decays is responsible for powering the light curves of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), gamma rays themselves are of particular interest as a diagnostic tool because they provide a direct way to obtain deeper insights into the nucleosynthesis and the kinematics of these explosion events. Focusing on two of the most broadly discussed SN Ia progenitor scenarios - a delayed detonation in a Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf (WD) and a violent merger of two WDs - we use three-dimensional explosion models and perform radiative transfer simulations to obtain synthetic gamma-ray spectra. Both chosen models produce the same mass of 56Ni and have similar optical properties that are in reasonable agreement with the recently observed supernova SN 2011fe. In contrast to the optical regime, the gamma-ray emission of our two chosen models proves to be rather different. The almost direct connection of the emission of gamma rays to fundamental physical processes occuring in SNe Ia permits additional constraints concerning several explosion model properties that are not easily accessible within other wavelength ranges. Proposed future MeV missions such as GRIPS will resolve all spectral details only for nearby SNe Ia, but hardness ratio and light curve measurements still allow for a distinction of the two different models at 10 and 16 Mpc for an exposure time of 10^6 s, respectively. The possibility to detect the strongest line features up to the Virgo distance will offer the opportunity to build up a first sample of SN Ia detections in the gamma-ray energy range and underlines the importance of future space observatories for MeV gamma rays. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)"

At the moment, the nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) model dominates the physical models for field extrapolation in the low corona. Recently we have developed a new NLFFF model with MHD relaxation to reconstruct the coronal magnetic field. This method is based on CESE--MHD model with the conservation-element/solution-element (CESE) spacetime scheme. In this paper, we report the application of the CESE--MHD--NLFFF code to \SDO/HMI data with magnetograms sampled for two active regions (ARs), NOAA AR 11158 and 11283, both of which were very non-potential, producing X-class flares and eruptions. The raw magnetograms are preprocessed to remove the force and then inputted into the extrapolation code. Qualitative comparison of the results with the \SDO/AIA images shows that our code can reconstruct magnetic field lines resembling the EUV-observed coronal loops. Most important structures of the active regions are reproduced excellently, like the highly-sheared field lines that suspend filaments in AR 11158 and twisted flux rope which corresponds to a sigmoid in AR 11283. Quantitative assess of the results shows that the force-free constraint is fulfilled very well in the strong-field regions but apparently not that well in the weak-field regions because of data noise and numerical errors in the small currents. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Balmaceda,  Edward E. DeLuca;  The solar cycle and its associated magnetic activity are the main drivers behind changes in the interplanetary environment and the Earth's upper atmosphere (commonly referred to as space weather). These changes have a direct impact on the lifetime of space-based assets and can create hazards to astronauts in space. In recent years there has been an effort to develop accurate solar cycle predictions (with aims at predicting the long-term evolution of space weather), leading to nearly a hundred widely spread predictions for the amplitude of solar cycle 24. A major contributor to the disagreement is the lack of direct long-term databases covering different components of the solar magnetic field (toroidal vs.\ poloidal). Here we use sunspot area and polar faculae measurements spanning a full century (as our toroidal and poloidal field proxies), to study solar cycle propagation, memory, and prediction. Our results substantiate predictions based on the polar magnetic fields, whereas we find sunspot area to be uncorrelated to cycle amplitude unless multiplied by area-weighted average tilt. This suggests that the joint assimilation of tilt and sunspot area is a better choice (with aims to cycle prediction) than sunspot area alone, and adds to the evidence in favor of active region emergence and decay as the main mechanism of poloidal field generation (i.e. the Babcock-Leighton mechanism). Finally, by looking at the correlation between our poloidal and toroidal proxies across multiple cycles, we find solar cycle memory to be limited to only one cycle. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

The binaries can experience coherent eccentricity oscillations as well as excursions to very high eccentricity that occur over a much larger fraction of the parameter space than in triple systems. For a ratio of outer to inner semi-major axes of 10 to 20, about 30 to 50% of equal-mass quadruples reach eccentricity 1-e < 10^{-3} in one of the binaries. This is about 4 to 12 times more than for triples with equivalent parameters. Orbital ""flips"" and collisions without previous tidal interaction are similarly enhanced in quadruples relative to triples. We argue that the frequency of evolutionary paths influenced by KL cycles is comparable in the triple and quadruple populations even though field quadruples are a factor of ~5 less frequent than triples. Additionally, quadruples might be a non-negligible source of triples and provide fundamentally new evolutionary outcomes involving close binaries, mergers, collisions, and associated transients, which occur without any fine tuning of parameters. Finally, we study the perturbations to a planetary orbit due to a distant binary and we find that the fraction of orbital flips is a factor of 3 to 4 higher than for the corresponding triple system given our fiducial parameters with implications for hot Jupiters and star-planet collisions.

Montgomery,  Patrick Dufour,  S. O. Kepler,  J. J. Hermes,  Ross E. Falcon,  K. I. Winget,  Michael Bolte,  K. H. R. Rubin;"  We present the discovery of photometric variability in the DQ white dwarf SDSS J103655.39+652252.2 (SDSS J1036+6522). Time-series photometry reveals a coherent monoperiodic modulation at a period of 1115.64751(67) s with an amplitude of 0.442% +/- 0.024%; no other periodic modulations are observed with amplitudes >~0.13%. The period, amplitude, and phase of this modulation are constant within errors over 16 months. The spectrum of SDSS J1036+6522 shows magnetic splitting of carbon lines, and we use Paschen-Back formalism to develop a grid of model atmospheres for mixed carbon and helium atmospheres. Our models, while reliant on several simplistic assumptions, nevertheless match the major spectral and photometric properties of the star with a self-consistent set of parameters: Teff~15,500 K, log g ~9, log(C/He)=-1.0, and a mean magnetic field strength of 3.0 +/- 0.2 MG. The temperature and abundances strongly suggest that SDSS J1036+6522 is a transition object between the hot, carbon-dominated DQs and the cool, He-dominated DQs. The variability of SDSS J1036+6522 has characteristics similar to those of the variable hot carbon-atmosphere white dwarfs (DQVs), however, its temperature is significantly cooler. The pulse profile of SDSS J1036+6522 is nearly sinusoidal, in contrast with the significantly asymmetric pulse shapes of the known magnetic DQVs. If the variability in SDSS J1036+6522 is due to the same mechanism as other DQVs, then the pulse shape is not a definitive diagnostic on the absence of a strong magnetic field in DQVs. It remains unclear whether the root cause of the variability in SDSS J1036+6522 and the other hot DQVs is the same. ";Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.3167;Dynamics of the solar tachocline III: Numerical solutions of the Gough  and McIntyre model; Luis A. Acevedo-Arreguin,  Pascale Garaud,  Toby S. Wood;  We present the first numerical simulations of the solar interior to exhibit a tachocline consistent with the Gough and McIntyre (1998) model. We find nonlinear, axisymmetric, steady-state numerical solutions in which: (1) a large-scale primordial field is confined within the radiation zone by downwelling meridional flows that are gyroscopically pumped in the convection zone (2) the radiation zone is in almost-uniform rotation, with a rotation rate consistent with observations (3) the bulk of the tachocline is magnetic free, in thermal-wind balance and in thermal equilibrium and (4) the interaction between the field and the flows takes place within a very thin magnetic boundary layer, the tachopause, located at the bottom of the tachocline. We show that the thickness of the tachocline scales with the amplitude of the meridional flows exactly as predicted by Gough and McIntyre. We also determine the parameter conditions under which such solutions can be obtained, and provide a simple explanation for the failure of previous numerical attempts at reproducing the Gough and McIntyre model. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for future numerical models of the solar interior, and for future observations of the Sun and other stars. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Vilmer,  the SEPServer Consortium;  Solar energetic particle (SEP) events are a prime opportunity to probe astrophysical particle acceleration by combining in-situ measurements of particles in space with remote sensing of the hard X-ray (HXR) and \gamma-ray emitting particles in the solar atmosphere. For the space environment SEPs are among the biggest hazards, particularly for spacecraft and human exploration of the solar system. Unfortunately our current understanding of the acceleration and transport of SEPs is weak. With the increasing onset of the space age it is vitally important that we increase our knowledge of the physical mechanisms related to SEPs. In this direction, the SEPServer project aims at building an on-line server that will provide the space research community with SEP data and related observations of solar electromagnetic emission. INTEGRAL/SPI acquires observations from many X-ray/\gamma-ray flares associated with SEP events. To make this data accessible for SEP studies we have undertaken a major effort to specify the solar observing conditionS of INTEGRAL through Monte-Carlo simulations of its BGO-detector response for several flares associated with selected SEP events. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.3337;Evidence for quasi-chemically homogeneous evolution of massive stars up  to solar metallicity; F. Martins (1),  E. Depagne (2),  D. Russeil (3),  L. Mahy (4) (1- LUPM, CNRS & Montpellier University, 2- Leibniz-Institut fur Astrophysik Potsdam, 3- LAM, CNRS & Marseille University, 4- Liège University,);  Long soft gamma ray bursts (LGRBs) are usually associated with the death of the most massive stars. A large amount of core angular momentum in the phases preceding the explosion is required to form LGRBs. A very high initial rotational velocity can provide this angular momentum. Such a velocity strongly influences the way the star evolves: it is chemically homogeneously mixed and evolves directly towards the blue part of the HR diagram from the main sequence. We have shown that chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE) takes place in the SMC, at low metallicity. We want to see if there is a metallicity threshold above which such an evolution does not exist. We perform a spectroscopic analysis of H-rich early-type WN stars in the LMC and the Galaxy. We use the code CMFGEN to determine the fundamental properties and the surface composition of the target stars. We then place the stars in the HR diagram and determine their evolution. We show that both the LMC and Galactic WNh stars we selected cannot be explained by standard stellar evolution. They are located on the left of the main sequence but show surface abundances typical of CN equilibrium. In addition, they still contain a large amount of hydrogen. They are thus core-H burning objects. Their properties are consistent with CHE. We determine the metallicity of the Galactic stars from their position and Galactic metallicity gradients, and conclude that they have 0.6<Z<1.0. A moderate coupling between the core and the envelope is required to explain that stellar winds do not extract to much angular momentum to prevent a blueward evolution. In view of the findings that some long gamma ray bursts appear in solar environments, CHE may be a viable way to form them over a wide range of metallicities. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Sjoberg;  FS Aur is famous for a variety of uncommon and puzzling periodic photometric and spectroscopic variabilities. It was previously proposed that the precession of a fast-rotating magnetically accreting white dwarf can successfully explain these phenomena. We present a study of FS Aur based on two extensive sets of optical photometric observations and three X-ray data sets in which we intended to verify whether the observational properties of the long period modulations observed in FS Aur and V455 And are similar in appearance to the spin modulation in ordinary IPs. These new optical observations have revealed, for the first time in photometric data, the variability with the presumed precession period of the white dwarf, previously seen only spectroscopically. We also found that the modulations with the precession and orbital periods are evident in X-ray data. We show that the observed properties of FS Aur closely resemble those of other intermediate polars, thus confirming this cataclysmic variable as a member of the class. Our analysis of multicolour observations of intermediate polars has shown that time-series analysis of colour indices appears to be a powerful technique for revealing hidden variabilities and shedding light on their nature. We have found that the (B-I) power spectrum of V1223 Sgr indicates the presence in the data of the spin pulsation which is not seen in the optical light curve at all. Also, the analysis of the colour indices of V455 And revealed the presence of the photometric variations which, similarly to FS Aur, was previously observed only spectroscopically. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

HD 150136 is a triple hierarchical system and a non-thermal radio emitter. It is formed by an O3-3.5 V + O5.5-6 V close binary and a more distant O6.5-7 V tertiary. So far, only the inner orbital properties have been reliably constrained. Aims. To quantitatively understand the non-thermal emission process, accurate knowledge of the physical and orbital properties of the object is crucial. Here, we aim to investigate the orbital properties of the wide system and to constrain the inclinations of the inner and outer binaries, and with these the absolute masses of the system components. Methods. We used the PIONIER combiner at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer to obtain the very first interferometric measurements of HD 150136. We combined the interferometric observations with new and existing high resolution spectroscopic data to derive the orbital solution of the outer companion in the three-dimensional space. Results. The wide system is clearly resolved by PIONIER, with a projected separation on the plane of the sky of about 9 milli-arcsec. The best-fit orbital period, eccentricity, and inclination are 8.2 yr, 0.73 and 108 degr. We constrain the masses of the three stars of the system to 63 +/- 10, 40 +/- 6, and 33 +/- 12 Msun for the O3-3.5 V, O5.5-6 V and O6.5-7 V components. Conclusions. The dynamical masses agree within errors with the evolutionary masses of the components. Future interferometric and spectroscopic monitoring of HD 150136 should allow one to reduce the uncertainties to a few per cent only and to accurately constrain the distance to the system. This makes HD 150136 an ideal system to quantitatively test evolutionary models of high-mass stars as well as the physics of non-thermal processes occurring in O-type systems. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

A parameter $\delta$S is defined as the difference between $S\rm_{HK}$ and a `zero' emission line fitted by several of the most inactive stars. The $S\rm_{HK}$ indices of subgiant stars tend to be much lower than dwarfs, which provide a way to distinguish dwarfs and giants with relatively low resolution spectra. Cooler stars are generally more active and display a larger scatter than hotter stars. Stars associated with the thick disk are in general less active than those of the thin disk. The fraction of K dwarfs that are active drops with vertical distance from the Galactic plane. Metallicity affects $S\rm_{HK}$ measurements differently among F, G and K dwarfs in this sample. Using the open clusters NGC 2420, M67 and NGC6791 as calibrations, ages of most field stars in this SDSS sample range from 3-8 Gyr. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

The distances of these white dwarfs are estimated using the method of Synthetic Spectral Distances. All of these WDs are found to be in the Galactic disk from our analysis of space motions.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.3619;Comparison of force-free coronal magnetic field modeling using vector  fields from Hinode and Solar Dynamics Observatory; J. K. Thalmann,  S. K. Tiwari,  T. Wiegelmann;  Photospheric magnetic vector maps from two different instruments are used to model the nonlinear force-free coronal magnetic field above an active region. We use vector maps inferred from polarization measurements of the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) and the Solar Optical Telescope Spectropolarimeter (SP) aboard Hinode. Besides basing our model calculations on HMI data, we use both, SP data of original resolution and scaled down to the resolution of HMI. This allows us to compare the model results based on data from different instruments and to investigate how a binning of high-resolution data effects the model outcome. The resulting 3D magnetic fields are compared in terms of magnetic energy content and magnetic topology. We find stronger magnetic fields in the SP data, translating into a higher total magnetic energy of the SP models. The net Lorentz forces of the HMI and SP lower boundaries verify their force-free compatibility. We find substantial differences in the absolute estimates of the magnetic field energy but similar relative estimates, e.g., the fraction of excess energy and of the flux shared by distinct areas. The location and extension of neighboring connectivity domains differs and the SP model fields tend to be higher and more vertical. Hence, conclusions about the magnetic connectivity based on force-free field models are to be drawn with caution. We find that the deviations of the model solution when based on the lower-resolution SP data are small compared to the differences of the solutions based on data from different instruments. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Bergin,  Ruud Visser;"  We present simple analytic solutions for the ionization rate $\zeta_{\rm{SLR}}$ arising from the decay of short-lived radionuclides (SLRs) within protoplanetary disks. We solve the radiative transfer problem for the decay products within the disk, and thereby allow for the loss of radiation at low disk surface densities; energy loss becomes important outside $R\gtrsim30$ for typical disk masses $M_g=0.04$ M$_\odot$. Previous studies of chemistry/physics in these disks have neglected the impact of ionization by SLRs, and often consider only cosmic rays (CRs), because of the high CR-rate present in the ISM. However, recent work suggests that the flux of CRs present in the circumstellar environment could be substantially reduced by relatively modest stellar winds, resulting in severely modulated CR ionization rates, $\zeta_{\rm{CR}}$, equal to or substantially below that of SLRs ($\zeta_{\rm{SLR}}\lesssim10^{-18}$ s$^{-1}$). We compute the net ionizing particle fluxes and corresponding ionization rates as a function of position within the disk for a variety of disk models. The resulting expressions are especially simple for the case of vertically gaussian disks (frequently assumed in the literature). Finally, we provide a power-law fit to the ionization rate in the midplane as a function of gas disk surface density and time. Depending on location in the disk, the ionization rates by SLRs are typically in the range $\zeta_{\rm{SLR}}\sim(1-10)\times10^{-19}$ s$^{-1}$. ";Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.0033;Magnetic Inhibition of Convection and the Fundamental Properties of  Low-Mass Stars. I. Stars with a Radiative Core; Gregory A. Feiden,  Brian Chaboyer;  Magnetic fields are hypothesized to inflate the radii of low-mass stars---defined as less massive than 0.8$M_\odot$---in detached eclipsing binaries (DEBs). We investigate this hypothesis using the recently introduced magnetic Dartmouth stellar evolution code. In particular, we focus on stars thought to have a radiative core and convective outer envelope by studying in detail three individual DEBs: UV Psc, YY Gem, and CU Cnc. The results suggest that the stabilization of thermal convection by a magnetic field is a plausible explanation for the observed model-radius discrepancies. However, surface magnetic field strengths required by the models are significantly stronger than those estimated from the observed coronal X-ray emission. Agreement between model predicted surface magnetic field strengths and those inferred from X-ray observations can be found by assuming that the magnetic field sources its energy from convection. This approach makes the transport of heat by convection less efficient and is akin to reduced convective mixing length methods used in other studies. Predictions for the metallicity and magnetic field strengths of the aforementioned systems are reported. We also develop an expression relating a reduction in the convective mixing length to a magnetic field strength in units of the equipartition value. Our results are compared with those from previous investigations to incorporate magnetic fields to explain the low-mass DEB radius inflation. Finally, we explore how the effects of magnetic fields might affect mass determinations using asteroseismic data and the implication of magnetic fields on exoplanet studies. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Despite the closed bubble morphology of this WR nebula, the XMM-Newton observations show no evidence of diffuse emission in its interior as in the similar WR bubbles NGC6888 and S308. We use the present observations to estimate a 3-\sigma upper limit to the X-ray luminosity in the 0.3-1.5 keV energy band equal to 7.4x10^{32} erg s^{-1} for the diffuse emission from the WR nebula, assuming a distance of 2.37 kpc. The WR nebula around WR16 is the fourth observed by the current generation of X-ray satellites and the second not detected. We also examine FUSE spectra to search for nebular O VI absorption lines in the stellar continuum of WR16. The present far-UV data and the lack of measurements of the dynamics of the optical WR bubble do not allow us to confirm the existence of a conductive layer of gas at T~3x10^5 K between the cold nebular gas and the hot gas in its interior.

An important ingredient in binary evolution is the common-envelope (CE) phase. Although this phase is believed to be responsible for the formation of many close binaries, the process is not well understood. Aims. We investigate the characteristics of the population of post-common-envelope binaries (PCEB). As the evolution of these binaries and their stellar components are relatively simple, this population can be directly used to constraint CE evolution. Methods. We use the binary population synthesis code SeBa to simulate the current-day population of PCEBs in the Galaxy. We incorporate the selection effects in our model that are inherent to the general PCEB population and that are specific to the SDSS survey, which enables a direct comparison for the first time between the synthetic and observed population of visible PCEBs. Results. We find that selection effects do not play a significant role on the period distribution of visible PCEBs. To explain the observed dearth of long-period systems, the {\alpha}-CE efficiency of the main evolutionary channel must be low. In the main channel, the CE is initiated by a red giant as it fills its Roche lobe in a dynamically unstable way. Other evolutionary paths cannot be constrained more. Additionally our model reproduces well the observed space density, the fraction of visible PCEBs amongst white dwarf (WD)- main sequence (MS) binaries, and the WD mass versus MS mass distribution, but overestimates the fraction of PCEBs with helium WD companions. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Althaus;  We argue that the properties of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) SN 2011fe can be best explained within the frame of the core-degenerate (CD) scenario. In the CD scenario a white dwarf (WD) merges with the core of an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star and forms a rapidly rotating WD, with a mass close to and above the critical mass for explosion. Rapid rotation prevents immediate collapse and/or explosion. Spinning down over a time of 0-10 Gyr brings the WD to explosion. A very long delayed explosion to post-crystallization phase, which lasts for about 2 Gyr leads to the formation of a highly carbon-enriched outer layer. This can account for the carbon-rich composition of the fastest-moving ejecta of SN 2011fe. In reaching the conclusion that the CD scenario best explains the observed properties of SN 2011fe we consider both its specific properties, like a very compact exploding object and carbon rich composition of the fastest-moving ejecta, and the general properties of SNe Ia. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO)"

The part of these changes is the result of the absorption of stellar radiation by the gas component of circumstellar (CS) disk around the secondary. The other part arises due to the obscuration of the stellar photosphere and the closest circumstellar area by the dusty CS disk. Comparison of our results with the previous one, obtained by Lambert & Sawyer during the 1982-1984 eclipse, indicates the good agreement, and argues in favor of stability of the secondary disk structure.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.0378;Three-dimensional numerical simulation of magnetohydrodynamic-gravity  waves and vortices in the solar atmosphere; K. Murawski,  I. Ballai,  A.K. Srivastava,  D. Lee;  With the adaptation of the FLASH code we simulate magnetohydrodynamic-gravity waves and vortices as well as their response in the magnetized three-dimensional (3D) solar atmosphere at different heights to understand the localized energy transport processes. In the solar atmosphere strongly structured by gravitational and magnetic forces, we launch a localized velocity pulse (in horizontal and vertical components) within a bottom layer of 3D solar atmosphere modelled by initial VAL-IIIC conditions, which triggers waves and vortices. The rotation direction of vortices depends on the orientation of an initial perturbation. The vertical driver generates magnetoacoustic-gravity waves which result in oscillations of the transition region, and it leads to the eddies with their symmetry axis oriented vertically. The horizontal pulse excites all magnetohydrodynamic-gravity waves and horizontally oriented eddies. These waves propagate upwards, penetrate the transition region, and enter the solar corona. In the high-beta plasma regions the magnetic field lines move with the plasma and the temporal evolution show that they swirl with eddies. We estimate the energy fluxes carried out by the waves in the magnetized solar atmosphere and conclude that such wave dynamics and vortices may be significant in transporting the energy to sufficiently balance the energy losses in the localized corona. Moreover, the structure of the transition region highly affects such energy transports, and causes the channelling of the propagating waves into the inner corona. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Previous large-area searches have been incomplete for L/T transition dwarfs, because these objects are faint in optical bands and have near-infrared colors that are difficult to distinguish from background stars. To overcome these obstacles, we have cross-matched the Pan-STARRS1 (optical) and WISE (mid-IR) catalogs to produce a unique multi-wavelength database for finding ultracool dwarfs. As part of our initial discoveries, we have identified seven brown dwarfs in the L/T transition within 9-15 pc of the Sun. The L9.5 dwarf PSO J140.2308+45.6487 and the T1.5 dwarf PSO J307.6784+07.8263 (both independently discovered by Mace et al. 2013) show possible spectroscopic variability at the Y- and J-bands. Two more objects in our sample show evidence of photometric J-band variability, and two others are candidate unresolved binaries based on their spectra. We expect our full search to yield a well-defined, volume-limited sample of L/T transition dwarfs that will include many new targets for study of this complex regime. PSO J307.6784+07.8263 in particular may be an excellent candidate for in-depth study of variability, given its brightness (J = 14.2 mag) and proximity (11 pc). ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.0548;Two semi-automated computational approaches for spectroscopic analysis  of stellar photospheres: detailed characterization at high resolution and  abundance determination at medium resolution; Andre Milone,  Ronaldo da Silva,  Anne Sansom,  Patricia Sanchez-Blazquez;  We report on two distinct computational approaches to self-consistently measure photospheric properties of large samples of stars. Both procedures consist of a set of several semi-integrated tasks based on shell and Python scripts, which efficiently run either our own codes or open source software commonly adopted by the astronomical community. One approach aims to derive the main stellar photospheric parameters and abundances of a few elements by analysing high-resolution spectra from a given public library homogeneously constructed. The other one is applied to recover the abundance of a single element in stars with known photospheric parameters by using mid-resolution spectra from another open homogeneous database and calibrating derived abundances. Both semi-automated computational approaches provide homogeneity and objectivity to every step of the process and represent a fast way to reach partial and final results as well as to estimate measurement errors, making possible to systematically evaluate and improve the distinct steps. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.0600;Evolution and CNO yields of Z=10^-5 stars and possible effects on CEMP  production; P. Gil-Pons,  C.L. Doherty,  H. Lau,  S. W. Campbell,  T. Suda,  S. Guilani,  J. Gutierrez,  J. Lattanzio;  Our main goals are to get a deeper insight into the evolution and final fates of intermediate-mass, extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars. We also aim to investigate their C, N, and O yields. Using the Monash University Stellar Evolution code we computed and analysed the evolution of stars of metallicity Z = 10^-5 and masses between 4 and 9 M_sun, from their main sequence until the late thermally pulsing (super) asymptotic giant branch, TP-(S)AGB phase. Our model stars experience a strong C, N, and O envelope enrichment either due to the second dredge-up, the dredge-out phenomenon, or the third dredge-up early during the TP-(S)AGB phase. Their late evolution is therefore similar to that of higher metallicity objects. When using a standard prescription for the mass loss rates during the TP-(S)AGB phase, the computed stars lose most of their envelopes before their cores reach the Chandrasekhar mass, so our standard models do not predict the occurrence of SNI1/2 for Z = 10^-5 stars. However, we find that the reduction of only one order of magnitude in the mass-loss rates, which are particularly uncertain at this metallicity, would prevent the complete ejection of the envelope, allowing the stars to either explode as an SNI1/2 or become an electron-capture SN. Our calculations stop due to an instability near the base of the convective envelope that hampers further convergence and leaves remnant envelope masses between 0.25 M_sun for our 4 M_sun model and 1.5 M_sun for our 9 M_sun model. We present two sets of C, N, and O yields derived from our full calculations and computed under two different assumptions, namely, that the instability causes a practically instant loss of the remnant envelope or that the stars recover and proceed with further thermal pulses. Our results have implications for the early chemical evolution of the Universe. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.0627;Temporal relation between quiet-Sun transverse fields and the strong  flows detected by IMaX/SUNRISE; C. Quintero Noda,  V. Martínez Pillet,  J.M. Borrero,  S.K. Solanki;"  Localized strongly Doppler-shifted Stokes V signals were detected by IMaX/SUNRISE. These signals are related to newly emerged magnetic loops that are observed as linear polarization features. We aim to set constraints on the physical nature and causes of these highly Doppler-shifted signals. In particular, the temporal relation between the appearance of transverse fields and the strong Doppler shifts is analyzed in some detail. We calculated the time difference between the appearance of the strong flows and the linear polarization. We also obtained the distances from the center of various features to the nearest neutral lines and whether they overlap or not. These distances were compared with those obtained from randomly distributed points on observed magnetograms. Various cases of strong flows are described in some detail. The linear polarization signals precede the appearance of the strong flows by on average 84+-11 seconds. The strongly Doppler-shifted signals are closer (0.19"") to magnetic neutral lines than randomly distributed points (0.5""). Eighty percent of the strongly Doppler-shifted signals are close to a neutral line that is located between the emerging field and pre-existing fields. That the remaining 20% do not show a close-by pre-existing field could be explained by a lack of sensitivity or an unfavorable geometry of the pre-existing field, for instance, a canopy-like structure. Transverse fields occurred before the observation of the strong Doppler shifts. The process is most naturally explained as the emergence of a granular-scale loop that first gives rise to the linear polarization signals, interacts with pre-existing fields (generating new neutral line configurations), and produces the observed strong flows. This explanation is indicative of frequent small-scale reconnection events in the quiet Sun. ";Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.0635;Optical spectropolarimetry of V4332 Sagittarii; T. Kamiński,  R. Tylenda;  The eruption of V4332 Sgr was observed in 1994. During the outburst, the object became extremely red, so it has been considered as to belong to red transients of the V838 Mon type. Optical spectroscopy obtained a few years after the eruption showed a faint M-type stellar spectrum underlying numerous molecular and atomic emission features. It has recently been suggested that the central object in V4332 Sgr is now hidden in a dusty disc and that the photospheric spectrum of this object observed in the optical results from scattering of the radiation of the central star on dust grains in the circumstellar matter. Recent polarimetric photometry has shown that the optical radiation of the object is indeed strongly polarized. We present and analyse our spectropolarimetric observations of V4332 Sgr obtained with the VLT in the optical region. The optical continuum of V4332 Sgr is linearly polarized with a typical degree of 16.6%. A clear depolarization is observed in the spectral regions where emission features contribute significantly to the observed flux. The only prominent exception is the CaI 6573 emission line, which is polarized in 21%. The results of our spectropolarimetric observations are in accord with the proposed geometry of the system and the advocated nature of the observed optical spectrum of V4332 Sgr. The continuum is not seen directly but results from scattering on dust within the disc and polar outflow, while most of the gas emission comes from the polar outflow excited by the radiation field of the central source. Additionally, the observed polarization patterns suggest a stratification of the outflow. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.0684;On the reliability of measuring differential rotation of spotted stars; Zsolt Kővári,  János Bartus,  Levente Kriskovics,  Krisztián Vida,  Katalin Oláh;  Cross-correlation of consecutive Doppler images is one of the most common techniques used to detect surface differential rotation (hereafter DR) on spotted stars. The disadvantage of a single cross-correlation is, however, that the expected DR pattern can be overwhelmed by sudden changes in the apparent spot configuration. Another way to reconstruct the image shear using Doppler imaging is to include a predefined latitude-dependent rotation law in the inversion code (`sheared image method'). However, special but not unusual spot distributions, such like a large polar cap or an equatorial belt (e.g., small random spots evenly distributed along the equator), can distort the rotation profile similarly as the DR does, consequently, yielding incorrect measure of the DR from the sheared image method. To avoid these problems, the technique of measuring DR from averaged cross-correlations using time-series Doppler images (`ACCORD') is introduced and the reliability of this tool is demonstrated on artificial data. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

White;  We comment on the potential for continuing asteroseismology of solar-type and red-giant stars in a 2-wheel Kepler Mission. Our main conclusion is that by targeting stars in the ecliptic it should be possible to perform high-quality asteroseismology, as long as favorable scenarios for 2-wheel pointing performance are met. Targeting the ecliptic would potentially facilitate unique science that was not possible in the nominal Mission, notably from the study of clusters that are significantly brighter than those in the Kepler field. Our conclusions are based on predictions of 2-wheel observations made by a space photometry simulator, with information provided by the Kepler Project used as input to describe the degraded pointing scenarios. We find that elevated levels of frequency-dependent noise, consistent with the above scenarios, would have a significant negative impact on our ability to continue asteroseismic studies of solar-like oscillators in the Kepler field. However, the situation may be much more optimistic for observations in the ecliptic, provided that pointing resets of the spacecraft during regular desaturations of the two functioning reaction wheels are accurate at the < 1 arcsec level. This would make it possible to apply a post-hoc analysis that would recover most of the lost photometric precision. Without this post-hoc correction---and the accurate re-pointing it requires---the performance would probably be as poor as in the Kepler-field case. Critical to our conclusions for both fields is the assumed level of pointing noise (in the short-term jitter and the longer-term drift). We suggest that further tests will be needed to clarify our results once more detail and data on the expected pointing performance becomes available, and we offer our assistance in this work. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.0731;One Possible Reason for Double-Peaked Maxima in Solar Cycles: Is a  Second Maximum of Solar Cycle 24 Coming?; Ali Kilcik,  Atila Ozguc;  We investigate solar activity by focusing on double maxima in solar cycles and try to estimate the shape of the current solar cycle (Cycle 24) during its maximum. We analyzed data for Solar Cycle 24 by using Learmonth Solar Observatory sunspot group data since 2008. All sunspot groups (SGs) recorded during this time interval were separated into two groups: The first group includes small SGs [A, B, C, H, classes by the Zurich classification], and the second group consists of large SGs [D, E, and F]. We then calculated small and large sunspot group numbers, their sunspot numbers [SSN] and Zurich numbers [Rz] from their daily mean numbers as observed on the solar disk during a given month. We found that the temporal variations for these three different separations behave similarly. We also analyzed the general shape of solar cycles from Cycle 1 to 23 by using monthly International Sunspot Number [ISSN] data and found that the durations of maxima were about 2.9 years. Finally, we used ascending time and SSN relationship and found that the maximum of the Cycle 24 should be later than 2011. Thus, we conclude that i) one possible reason for a double maximum in solar cycles is the different behavior of large and small sunspot groups, and ii) a double maximum is coming for Solar Cycle 24. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Importantly, Kepler's wide field-of-view would enable key spatially extended, nearby regions to be monitored in their entirety for the first time, and the proposed observations would exploit unique synergies with the GAIA ESO spectroscopic survey and, in the longer term, the GAIA mission itself. We also outline possible strategies for optimising the photometric performance of Kepler in two-wheel mode by modelling pixel sensitivity variations and other systematics. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

The degraded pointing stability will still allow observation of these stars with reasonable (better than millimag) precision. The Kep-Cont mission will allow studying the nonradial modes in Blazhko-modulated and first overtone RR Lyrae stars and will give a better view on the period jitter of the only Kepler Cepheid in the field. With continued continuous observation of the Kepler RR Lyrae sample we may get closer to the origin of the century-old Blazhko problem. Longer time-span may also uncover new dynamical effects like apsidal motion in eclipsing binaries. A continued mission will have the advantage of providing unprecedented, many-years-long homogeneous and continuous photometric data of the same targets. We investigate the pragmatic details of such a mission and find a number of advantages, especially the minimal need of reprogramming of the flight software. Another undeniable advantage of the current field of view is the completed, ongoing and planned ground-based follow-up observations and allocated telescope times focusing on the current field. We emphasize that while we propose this continuation as an independent mission, we can easily share slots with e.g. planetary mission with a strong belief that both (or more) communities can still benefit from Kepler's current capabilities. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

The degraded pointing stability will still allow observing these stars with reasonable (probably better than mmag) accuracy. Long-term continuous monitoring already proved to be extremely helpful to investigate several areas of stellar astrophysics. Space-based missions opened a new window to the dynamics of pulsation in several class of pulsating variable stars and facilitated detailed studies of eclipsing binaries. The main aim of this mission is to better understand the fascinating dynamics behind various stellar pulsational phenomena (resonances, mode coupling, chaos, mode selection) and interior physics (turbulent convection, opacities). This will also improve the applicability of these astrophysical tools for distance measurements, population and stellar evolution studies. We investigated the pragmatic details of such a mission and found a number of advantages: minimal reprogramming of the flight software, a favorable field of view, access to both galactic and LMC objects. However, the main advantage of the SEP field comes from the large sample of well classified targets, mainly through OGLE. Synergies and significant overlap (spatial, temporal and in brightness) with both ground- (OGLE, LSST) and space-based missions (GAIA, TESS) will greatly enhance the scientific value of the Kepler-SEP mission. GAIA will allow full characterization of the distance indicators. TESS will continuously monitor this field for at least one year, and together with the proposed mission provide long time series that cannot be obtained by other means. If Kepler-SEP program is successful, there is a possibility to place one of the so-called LSST ""deep-drilling"" fields in this region. ";Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.0742;Perpendicular Ion Heating by Reduced Magnetohydrodynamic Turbulence; Qian Xia,  Jean C. Perez,  Benjamin D. G. Chandran,  Eliot Quataert;  Recent theoretical studies argue that the rate of stochastic ion heating in low-frequency Alfv\'en-wave turbulence is given by $Q_\perp = c_1 [(\delta u)^3 /\rho] \exp(-c_2/\epsilon)$, where $\delta u$ is the rms turbulent velocity at the scale of the ion gyroradius $\rho$, $\epsilon = \delta u/v_{\perp \rm i}$, $v_{\perp \rm i}$ is the perpendicular ion thermal speed, and $c_1$ and $c_2$ are dimensionless constants. We test this theoretical result by numerically simulating test particles interacting with strong reduced magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) turbulence. The heating rates in our simulations are well fit by this formula. The best-fit values of $c_1$ are $\sim 1$. The best-fit values of $c_2$ decrease (i.e., stochastic heating becomes more effective) as the grid size and Reynolds number of the RMHD simulations increase. As an example, in a $1024^2 \times 256$ RMHD simulation with a dissipation wavenumber of order the inverse ion gyroradius, we find $c_2 = 0.21$. We show that stochastic heating is significantly stronger in strong RMHD turbulence than in a field of randomly phased Alfv\'en waves with the same power spectrum, because coherent structures in strong RMHD turbulence increase orbit stochasticity in the regions where ions are heated most strongly. We find that $c_1$ increases by a factor of $\sim 3$ while $c_2$ changes very little as the ion thermal speed increases from values $\ll v_{\rm A}$ to values $\sim v_{\rm A}$, where $v_{\rm A}$ is the Alfv\'en speed. We discuss the importance of these results for perpendicular ion heating in the solar wind. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Space Physics (physics.space-ph)"

Hirose;  Young stars with masses 2-8 Suns, called the Herbig Ae and Be stars, often show a near-infrared excess too large to explain with a hydrostatically-supported circumstellar disk of gas and dust. At the same time the accretion flow carrying the circumstellar gas to the star is thought to be driven by magneto-rotational turbulence, which according to numerical MHD modeling yields an extended low-density atmosphere supported by the magnetic fields. We demonstrate that the base of the atmosphere can be optically-thick to the starlight and that the parts lying near 1 AU are tall enough to double the fraction of the stellar luminosity reprocessed into the near-infrared. We generate synthetic spectral energy distributions (SEDs) using Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculations with opacities for sub-micron silicate and carbonaceous grains. The synthetic SEDs closely follow the median Herbig SED constructed recently by Mulders and Dominik, and in particular match the large near-infrared flux, provided the grains have a mass fraction close to interstellar near the disk's inner rim. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Here we revisit the issue of determining the substellar initial mass function (IMF), based on a comparison between NGC1333 and IC348, two clusters in the Perseus star-forming region. We derive their mass distributions for a range of model isochrones, varying distances, extinction laws and ages, with comprehensive assessments of the uncertainties. We find that the choice of isochrone and other parameters have significant effects on the results, thus we caution against comparing IMFs obtained using different approaches. For NGC1333, we find that the star/BD ratio R is between 1.9 and 2.4, for all plausible scenarios, consistent with our previous work. For IC348, R is between 2.9 and 4.0, suggesting that previous studies have overestimated this value. Thus, the star forming process generates about 2.5-5 substellar objects per 10 stars. The derived star/BD ratios correspond to a slope of the power-law mass function of alpha=0.7-1.0 for the 0.03-1.0Msol mass range. The median mass in these clusters - the typical stellar mass - is between 0.13-0.30Msol. Assuming that NGC1333 is at a shorter distance than IC348, we find a significant difference in the cumulative distribution of masses between the two clusters, resulting from an overabundance of very low mass objects in NGC1333. Gaia astrometry will constrain the cluster distances better and will lead to a more definitive conclusion. Furthermore, ratio R is somewhat larger in IC348 compared with NGC1333, although this difference is still within the margins of error. Our results indicate that environments with higher object density may produce a larger fraction of very low mass objects, in line with predictions for brown dwarf formation through gravitational fragmentation of filaments falling into a cluster potential. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)"

We study the close environment of nearby Cepheids using high spatial resolution observations in the mid-infrared with the VLTI/MIDI instrument, a two-beam interferometric recombiner. Methods. We obtained spectra and visibilities for the classical Cepheids X Sgr and T Mon. We fitted the MIDI measurements, supplemented by B, V, J, H, K literature photometry, with the numerical transfer code DUSTY to determine the dust shell parameters. We used a typical dust composition for circumstellar environments. Results. We detect an extended dusty environment in the spectra and visibilities for both stars, although T Mon might suffer from thermal background contamination. We attribute this to the presence of a circumstellar envelope (CSE) surrounding the Cepheids. This is optically thin for X Sgr (tau(0.55microns) = 0.008), while it appears to be thicker for T Mon (tau(0.55micron) = 0.15). They are located at about 15-20 stellar radii. Following our previous work, we derived a likely period-excess relation in the VISIR PAH1 filter, f(8.6micron)[%]= 0.81(+/-0.04)P[day]. We argue that the impact of CSEs on the mid-IR period-luminosity (P-L) relation cannot be negligible because they can bias the Cepheid brightness by up to about 30 %. For the K-band P-L relation, the CSE contribution seems to be lower (< 5 %), but the sample needs to be enlarged to firmly conclude that the impact of the CSEs is negligible in this band. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Richards;  Multi-wavelength centimeter continuum observations of non-dusty, non-pulsating K spectral-type red giants directly sample their chromospheres and wind acceleration zones. Such stars are feeble emitters at these wavelengths however, and previous observations have provided only a small number of modest S/N measurements slowly accumulated over three decades. We present multi-wavelength Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array thermal continuum observations of the wind acceleration zones of two dust-free red giants, Arcturus (Alpha Boo: K2 III) and Aldebaran (Alpha Tau: K5 III). Importantly, most of our observations of each star were carried out over just a few days, so that we obtained a snapshot of the different stellar atmospheric layers sampled at different wavelengths, independent of any long-term variability. We report the first detections at several wavelengths for each star including a detection at 10 cm (3.0 GHz: S band) for both stars and a 20 cm (1.5 GHz: L band) detection for Alpha Boo. This is the first time single luminosity class III red giants have been detected at these continuum wavelengths. Our long-wavelength data sample the outer layers of Alpha Boo's atmosphere where its wind velocity is approaching its terminal value and the ionization balance is becoming frozen-in. For Alpha Tau, however, our long-wavelength data are still sampling its inner atmosphere, where the wind is still accelerating probably due to its lower mass-loss rate. We compare our data with published semi-empirical models based on ultraviolet data, and the marked deviations highlight the need for new atmospheric models to be developed. Spectral indices are used to discuss the possible properties of the stellar atmospheres, and we find evidence for a rapidly cooling wind in the case of Alpha Boo. Finally, we develop a simple analytical wind model for Alpha Boo based on our new long-wavelength flux measurements. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.0881;Surface Waves in the paritally ionized solar plasma slab; B. P. Pandey;  The properties of surface waves in the partially ionized, incompressible magnetized plasma slab are investigated in the present work. The waves are affected by the non ideal MHD effects which causes the finite drift of the magnetic field in the medium. When the finite drift of the magnetic field is ignored, the characteristics of the wave propagation in the partially ionized plasma fluid is similar to the ideal MHD except now the propagation properties depend on the fractional ionization of the medium. In the presence of Hall diffusion, the propagation of the sausage and kink surface waves depends on the level of fractional ionization of the medium. When both the Hall and Pedersen diffusion are present in the medium, the waves undergoes damping. For typical solar parameters, waves may damp over few minutes. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)"

Freytag;  We present the first grid of mean three-dimensional (3D) spectra for pure-hydrogen (DA) white dwarfs based on 3D model atmospheres. We use CO5BOLD radiation-hydrodynamics 3D simulations instead of the mixing-length theory for the treatment of convection. The simulations cover the effective temperature range of 6000 < Teff (K) < 15,000 and the surface gravity range of 7 < log g < 9 where the large majority of DAs with a convective atmosphere are located. We rely on horizontally averaged 3D structures (over constant Rosseland optical depth) to compute <3D> spectra. It is demonstrated that our <3D> spectra can be smoothly connected to their 1D counterparts at higher and lower Teff where the 3D effects are small. Analytical functions are provided in order to convert spectroscopically determined 1D effective temperatures and surface gravities to 3D atmospheric parameters. We apply our improved models to well studied spectroscopic data sets from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the White Dwarf Catalog. We confirm that the so-called high-log g problem is not present when employing <3D> spectra and that the issue was caused by inaccuracies in the 1D mixing-length approach. The white dwarfs with a radiative and a convective atmosphere have derived mean masses that are the same within ~0.01 Msun, in much better agreement with our understanding of stellar evolution. Furthermore, the 3D atmospheric parameters are in better agreement with independent Teff and log g values from photometric and parallax measurements. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

";  The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) has confirmed the standard solar model and neutrino oscillations through the observation of neutrinos from the solar core. In this paper we present a search for neutrinos associated with sources other than the solar core, such as gamma-ray bursters and solar flares. We present a new method for looking for temporal coincidences between neutrino events and astrophysical bursts of widely varying intensity. No correlations were found between neutrinos detected in SNO and such astrophysical sources. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.0929;The binary fractions in the massive young Large Magellanic Cloud star  clusters NGC 1805 and NGC 1818; Chengyuan Li,  Richard de Grijs,  Licai Deng;  Using high-resolution data sets obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope, we investigate the radial distributions of the F-type main-sequence binary fractions in the massive young Large Magellanic Cloud star clusters NGC 1805 and NGC 1818. We apply both an isochrone-fitting approach and chi^2 minimization using Monte Carlo simulations, for different mass-ratio cut-offs, q, and present a detailed comparison of the methods' performance. Both methods yield the same radial binary fraction profile for the same cluster, which therefore supports the robustness and applicability of either method to young star clusters which are as yet unaffected by the presence of multiple stellar populations. The binary fractions in these two clusters are characterized by opposite trends in their radial profiles. NGC 1805 exhibits a decreasing trend with increasing radius in the central region, followed by a slow increase to the field's binary-fraction level, while NGC 1818 shows a monotonically increasing trend. This may indicate dominance of a more complicated physical mechanism in the cluster's central region than expected a priori. Time-scale arguments imply that early dynamical mass segregation should be very efficient and, hence, likely dominates the dynamical processes in the core of NGC 1805. Meanwhile, in NGC 1818 the behavior in the core is probably dominated by disruption of soft binary systems. We speculate that this may be owing to the higher velocity dispersion in the NGC 1818 core, which creates an environment in which the efficiency of binary disruption is high compared with that in the NGC 1805 core. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)"

Callingham,  D. Compton,  I. Csányi,  A. Derekas,  J. Dorval,  D. Huber,  O. Shrier,  A. E. Simon,  D. Stello,  Gy. M. Szabó,  R. Szabó,  K. Szatmáry;  M giants are among the longest-period pulsating stars which is why their studies were traditionally restricted to analyses of low-precision visual observations, and more recently, accurate ground-based data. Here we present an overview of M giant variability on a wide range of time-scales (hours to years), based on analysis of thirteen quarters of Kepler long-cadence observations (one point per every 29.4 minutes), with a total time-span of over 1000 days. About two-thirds of the sample stars have been selected from the ASAS-North survey of the Kepler field, with the rest supplemented from a randomly chosen M giant control sample. We first describe the correction of the light curves from different quarters, which was found to be essential. We use Fourier analysis to calculate multiple frequencies for all stars in the sample. Over 50 stars show a relatively strong signal with a period equal to the Kepler-year and a characteristic phase dependence across the whole field-of-view. We interpret this as a so far unidentified systematic effect in the Kepler data. We discuss the presence of regular patterns in the distribution of multiple periodicities and amplitudes. In the period-amplitude plane we find that it is possible to distinguish between solar-like oscillations and larger amplitude pulsations which are characteristic for Mira/SR stars. This may indicate the region of the transition between two types of oscillations as we move upward along the giant branch. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.1018;Fragmentation, infall, and outflow around the showcase massive protostar  NGC7538 IRS1 at 500 AU resolution; H. Beuther,  H. Linz,  Th. Henning;"  Aims: Revealing the fragmentation, infall, and outflow processes in the immediate environment around massive young stellar objects is crucial for understanding the formation of the most massive stars. Methods: With this goal in mind we present the so far highest spatial-resolution thermal submm line and continuum observations toward the young high-mass protostar NGC7538 IRS1. Using the Plateau de Bure Interferometer in its most extended configuration at 843mum wavelength, we achieved a spatial resolution of 0.2""x0.17"", corresponding to ~500AU at a distance of 2.7\,kpc. Results: For the first time, we have observed the fragmentation of the dense inner core of this region with at least three subsources within the inner 3000 AU. The outflow exhibits blue- and red-shifted emission on both sides of the central source indicating that the current orientation has to be close to the line-of-sight, which differs from other recent models. We observe rotational signatures in northeast-southwest direction; however, even on scales of 500 AU, we do not identify any Keplerian rotation signatures. This implies that during the early evolutionary stages any stable Keplerian inner disk has to be very small (<=500 AU). The high-energy line HCN(4-3)v2=1 (E_u/k=1050K) is detected over an extent of approximately 3000 AU. In addition to this, the detection of red-shifted absorption from this line toward the central dust continuum peak position allows us to estimate infall rates of ~1.8x10^(-3)Msun/yr on the smallest spatial scales. Although all that gas will not necessarily be accreted onto the central protostar, nevertheless, such inner core infall rates are among the best proxies of the actual accretion rates one can derive during the early embedded star formation phase. These data are consistent with collapse simulations and the observed high multiplicity of massive stars. ";Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.1073;Orbits and masses in the young triple system TWA 5; R. Köhler,  T. Ratzka,  M. G. Petr-Gotzens,  S. Correia;  We aim to improve the orbital elements and determine the individual masses of the components in the triple system TWA 5. Five new relative astrometric positions in the H band were recorded with the adaptive optics system at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). We combine them with data from the literature and a measurement in the Ks band. We derive an improved fit for the orbit of TWA 5Aa-b around each other. Furthermore, we use the third component, TWA 5B, as an astrometric reference to determine the motion of Aa and Ab around their center of mass and compute their mass ratio. We find an orbital period of 6.03+/-0.01 years and a semi-major axis of 63.7+/-0.2 mas (3.2+/-0.1 AU). With the trigonometric distance of 50.1+/-1.8 pc, this yields a system mass of 0.9+/-0.1 Msun, where the error is dominated by the error of the distance. The dynamical mass agrees with the system mass predicted by a number of theoretical models if we assume that TWA5 is at the young end of the age range of the TW Hydrae association. We find a mass ratio of M_Ab / M_Aa = 1.3 +0.6/-0.4, where the less luminous component Ab is more massive. This result is likely to be a consequence of the large uncertainties due to the limited orbital coverage of the observations. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Our 94-ks XMM-Newton observation of the high magnetic field 5*10^13 G pulsar reveals a blackbody spectrum (kT~130 eV) with a broad absorption feature, possibly composed of two lines at ~1.0 and ~1.3 keV. We performed a correlation analysis of the X-ray photons with radio pulses detected in 16.2 hours of simultaneous observations at 1-2 GHz with the Green Bank, Effelsberg, and Parkes telescopes, respectively. Both the detected X-ray photons and radio pulses appear to be randomly distributed in time. We find tentative evidence for a correlation between the detected radio pulses and X-ray photons on timescales of less than 10 pulsar spin periods, with the probability of this occurring by chance being 0.46%. This suggests that the physical process producing the radio pulses may also heat the polar-cap. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)"

Brown (2),  Daren J. Burke (2) ((1) Department of Physics & Astronomy, University College London, UK, (2) Department of Chemistry, University College London, UK);  Glycolaldehyde, the simplest monosaccharide sugar, has recently been detected in low- and high-mass star-forming cores. Following on from our previous investigation into glycolaldehyde formation (Woods et al. 2012, ApJ, 750, 19), we now consider a further mechanism for the formation of glycolaldehyde that involves the dimerisation of the formyl radical, HCO. Quantum mechanical investigation of the HCO dimerisation process upon an ice surface is predicted to be barrierless and therefore fast. In an astrophysical context, we show that this mechanism can be very efficient in star-forming cores. It is limited by the availability of the formyl radical, but models suggest that only very small amounts of CO are required to be converted to HCO to meet the observational constraints. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Mizusawa;  Even with the diminished precision possible with only two reaction wheels, the Kepler spacecraft can obtain mmag level, time-resolved photometry of tens of thousands of sources. The presence of such a rich, large data set could be transformative for stellar astronomy. In this white paper, we discuss how rotation periods for a large ensemble of single and binary main- sequence dwarfs can yield a quantitative understanding of the evolution of stellar spin-down over time. This will allow us to calibrate rotation-based ages beyond ~1 Gyr, which is the oldest benchmark that exists today apart from the Sun. Measurement of rotation periods of M dwarfs past the fully-convective boundary will enable extension of gyrochronology to the end of the stellar main-sequence, yielding precise ages ({\sigma} ~10%) for the vast majority of nearby stars. It will also help set constraints on the angular momentum evolution and magnetic field generation in these stars. Our Kepler-based study would be supported by a suite of ongoing and future ground-based observations. Finally, we briefly discuss two ancillary science cases, detection of long-period low-mass eclipsing binaries and microvariability in white dwarfs and hot subdwarf B stars that the Kepler Two-Wheels Program would facilitate. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Astrometry at the U.S. Naval Observatory gives a parallax and distance of 30.86 +/- 0.25 pc and a tangential velocity of 98 km/s, and reveals binary orbital motion. The orbital parameters are determined from astrometry of the photocenter over more than three orbits of the 4.0-year period. High-resolution imaging at the Keck Observatory resolves the pair with a separation of 31 and 124 mas at two epochs. Optical and near-IR photometry give a set of possible binary components. Consistency of all data indicates that the binary is a pair of DA stars with temperatures near 8000 and 7400 K and with masses of 0.93 and 0.91 M_solar; also possible, is a DA primary and a helium DC secondary with temperatures near 8800 and 6000 K and with masses of 0.98 and 0.69 M_solar. In either case, the cooling ages of the stars are ~3 Gyr and the total ages are <4 Gyr. The combined mass of the binary (1.66--1.84 M_solar) is well above the Chandrasekhar limit; however, the timescale for coalescence is long. ";Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Sion,  Dean M. Townsley,  Damian Christian,  Ross E. Falcon,  Stylianos Pyrzas,  Justin Brown,  Kelsey Funkhouser;  Hubble Space Telescope spectra obtained in 2010 and 2011, three and four years after the large amplitude dwarf nova outburst of V455 And, were combined with optical photometry and spectra to study the cooling of the white dwarf, its spin, and possible pulsation periods after the outburst. The modeling of the ultraviolet (UV) spectra show that the white dwarf temperature remains ~600 K hotter than its quiescent value at three years post outburst, and still a few hundred degrees hotter at four years post outburst. The white dwarf spin at 67.6 s and its second harmonic at 33.8 s are visible in the optical within a month of outburst and are obvious in the later UV observations in the shortest wavelength continuum and the UV emission lines, indicating an origin in high temperature regions near the accretion curtains. The UV light curves folded on the spin period show a double-humped modulation consistent with two-pole accretion. The optical photometry two years after outburst shows a group of frequencies present at shorter periods (250-263 s) than the periods ascribed to pulsation at quiescence, and these gradually shift toward the quiescent frequencies (300-360 s) as time progresses past outburst. The most surprising result is that the frequencies near this period in the UV data are only prominent in the emission lines, not the UV continuum, implying an origin away from the white dwarf photosphere. Thus, the connection of this group of periods with non-radial pulsations of the white dwarf remains elusive. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.1234;KIC 7524178 -- an SU UMa-Type Dwarf Nova Showing Predominantly Negative  Superhumps throughout Supercycle; Taichi Kato (Kyoto U.),  Yoji Osaki (U. of Tokyo);  We analyzed the Kepler long cadence data of KIC 7524178 (=KIS J192254.92+430905.4), and found that it is an SU UMa-type dwarf nova with frequent normal outbursts. The signal of the negative superhump was always the dominant one even during the superoutburst, in contrast to our common knowledge about superhumps in dwarf novae. The signal of the positive superhump was only transiently seen during the superoutburst, and it quickly decayed after the superoutburst. The frequency variation of the negative superhump was similar to the two previously studied dwarf novae in the Kepler field, V1504 Cyg and V344 Lyr. This is the first object in which the negative superhumps dominate throughout the supercycle. Nevertheless, the superoutburst was faithfully accompanied by the positive superhump, indicating that the tidal eccentric instability is essential for triggering a superoutburst. All the pieces of evidence strengthen the thermal-tidal instability as the origin of the superoutburst and supercycle, making this object the third such example in the Kepler field. This object had unusually small (~1.0 mag) outburst amplitude and we discussed that the object has a high mass-transfer rate close to the thermal stability limit of the accretion disk. The periods of the negative and positive superhumps, and that of the candidate orbital period were 0.07288 d (average, variable in the range 0.0723-0.0731 d), 0.0785 d (average, variable in the range 0.0772-0.0788 d) and 0.074606(1) d, respectively. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Rajpurohit,  F. Allard,  D. Homeier,  A.C. Robin;  Stellar-substellar binary systems are quite rare, and provide interesting benchmarks. They constrain the complex physics of substellar atmospheres, because several physical parameters of the substellar secondary can be fixed from the much better characterized main sequence primary. We report the discovery of CFBDS J111807-064016, a T2 brown dwarf companion to 2MASS J111806.99-064007.8, a low-mass M4.5-M5 star. The brown-dwarf was identified from the Canada France Brown Dwarf Survey. At a distance of 50-120 pc, the 7.7 arcsec angular separation corresponds to projected separations of 390-900 AU. The primary displays no Halpha emission, placing a lower limit on the age of the system of about 6 Gyr. The kinematics is also consistent with membership in the old thin disc. We obtained near-infrared spectra, which together with recent atmosphere models allow us determine the effective temperature and gravity of both components. From these parameters and the age constraint, evolutionary models estimate masses of 0.10 to 0.15 Msol for the M dwarf, and 0.06 to 0.07 Msol for the T dwarf. This system is a particularly valuable benchmark because the brown dwarf is an early T: the cloud-clearing that occurs at the L/T transition is very sensitive to gravity, metallicity, and detailed dust properties, and produces a large scatter in the colours. This T2 dwarf, with its metallicity measured from the primary and its mass and gravity much better constrained than those of younger early-Ts, will anchor our understanding of the colours of L/T transition brown dwarfs. It is also one of the most massive T dwarfs, just below the hydrogen-burning limit, and all this makes it a prime probe a brown dwarf atmosphere and evolution models. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

This study presents a catalog including their coordinates, magnitudes, light curves, ephemerides, amplitudes, and type of variability. In addition, the variability of 17 known objects is confirmed, thus validating the results. The catalog contains a number of known and new variables that are of interest for further astrophysical investigations, in order to, e.g., search for additional bodies in eclipsing binary systems, or to test stellar interior models. Altogether, 209,070 stars were monitored with BEST II during a total of 128 nights in 2009/2010. The overall variability fraction of 1.2-1.5% in these target fields is well comparable to similar ground-based photometric surveys. Within the main magnitude range of $R\in\left[11,17\right]$, we identify 0.67(3)% of all stars to be eclipsing binaries, which indicates a completeness of about one third for this particular type in comparison to space surveys. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Seaton,  Anik De Groof,  Paul Shearer,  David Berghmans,  Bogdan Nicula;  The Sun Watcher with Active Pixels and Image Processing (SWAP) EUV solar telescope on board the Project for On-Board Autonomy 2 (PROBA2) spacecraft has been regularly observing the solar corona in a bandpass near 17.4 nm since February 2010. With a field-of-view of 54x54 arcmin, SWAP provides the widest-field images of the EUV corona available from the perspective of the Earth. By carefully processing and combining multiple SWAP images it is possible to produce low-noise composites that reveal the structure of the EUV corona to relatively large heights. A particularly important step in this processing was to remove instrumental stray light from the images by determining and deconvolving SWAP's point spread function (PSF) from the observations. In this paper we use the resulting images to conduct the first ever study of the evolution of the large-scale structure of the corona observed in the EUV over a three-year period that includes the complete rise phase of solar cycle 24. Of particular note is the persistence over many solar rotations of bright, diffuse features composed of open magnetic field that overlie polar crown filaments and extend to large heights above the solar surface. These features appear to be related to coronal fans, which have previously been observed in white-light coronagraph images and, at low heights, in the EUV. We also discuss the evolution of the corona at different heights above the solar surface and the evolution of the corona over the course of the solar cycle by hemisphere. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Space Physics (physics.space-ph)"

Favre;  Aims. Observations show nebulae around some massive stars but not around others. If observed, their chemical composition is far from homogeneous. Our goal is to put these observational features into the context of the evolution of massive stars and their circumstellar medium (CSM) and, more generally, to quantify the role of massive stars for the chemical and dynamical evolution of the ISM. Methods. Using the A-MAZE code, we perform 2d-axisymmetric hydrodynamical simulations of the evolution of the CSM, shaped by stellar winds, for a whole grid of massive stellar models from 15 to 120 Msun and following the stellar evolution from the zero-age main-sequence to the time of supernova explosion. In addition to the usual quantities, we also follow five chemical species: H, He, C, N, and O. Results. We show how various quantities evolve as a function of time: size of the bubble, position of the wind termination shock, chemical composition of the bubble, etc. The chemical composition of the bubble changes considerably compared to the initial composition, particularly during the red-supergiant (RSG) and Wolf-Rayet (WR) phases. In some extreme cases, the inner region of the bubble can be completely depleted in hydrogen and nitrogen, and is mainly composed of carbon, helium and oxygen. We argue why the bubble typically expands at a lower rate than predicted by self-similarity theory. In particular, the size of the bubble is very sensitive to the density of the ISM, decreasing by a factor of around 2.5 for each additional dex in ISM density. The bubble size also decreases with the metallicity of the central star, as low-metallicity stars have weaker winds.

From re-processing the unique long-term spectroscopic dataset of 70 days taken in 1996/97, we perform a thorough cross-correlation analysis to derive surface differential rotation. As a result we get solar-type differential rotation with a shear value alpha of 0.05, in agreement with preliminary suggestions from previous attempts. A possible surface pattern of meridional circulation is also detected. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Kraus (CfA/SAO, UT-Austin);  The coolest known brown dwarfs are our best analogs to extrasolar gas-giant planets. The prolific detections of such cold substellar objects in the past two years has spurred intensive followup, but the lack of accurate distances is a key gap in our understanding. We present a large sample of precise distances based on homogeneous mid-infrared astrometry that robustly establish absolute fluxes, luminosities, and temperatures. The coolest brown dwarfs have temperatures of 400-450 K and masses ~5-20 times that of Jupiter, showing they bridge the gap between hotter brown dwarfs and gas-giant planets. At these extremes, spectral energy distributions no longer follow a simple correspondence with temperature, suggesting an increasing role of other physical parameters such as surface gravity, vertical mixing, clouds, and metallicity. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Cowan;  Atomic transition probability measurements for 364 lines of Ti II in the UV through near IR are reported. Branching fractions from data recorded using a Fourier transform spectrometer and a new echelle spectrometer are combined with published radiative lifetimes to determine these transition probabilities. The new results are in generally good agreement with previously reported FTS measurements. Use of the new echelle spectrometer, independent radiometric calibration methods, and independent data analysis routines enables a reduction of systematic errors and overall improvement in transition probability accuracy over previous measurements. The new Ti II data are applied to high resolution visible and UV spectra of the Sun and metal-poor star HD 84937 to derive new, more accurate Ti abundances. Lines covering a range of wavelength and excitation potential are used to search for non-LTE effects. The Ti abundances derived using Ti II for these two stars match those derived using Ti I and support the relative Ti/Fe abundance ratio versus metallicity seen in previous studies. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.1475;The evolution of triples with a Roche-lobe filling outer star; Nathan de Vries,  Simon Portegies Zwart,  Joana Figueira;  The evolution of triples has not attracted much attention in the literature, although their evolution can be dramatically different from binaries and single stars. Triples are quite common, and we find that for about 1% of the triples in the Tokovinin catalogue of multiple stellar systems in the solar neighbourhood, the tertiary star will overflow its Roche lobe at some time in its evolution, before any of the inner stars leave the main sequence. For two of these systems, Xi Tauri and HD97131 we simulate in detail this phase of mass transfer, during which stellar evolution, gravitational dynamics and hydrodynamics all play an important role. We have used the Astrophysical Multi-purpose Software Environment (AMUSE) to solve these physical processes in a self-consistent way. The resulting evolution, mass transfer and the effects on the inner as well as on the outer orbit are profound, although it is not trivial to predict the eventual consequence of the phase of mass transfer and the appearance of the resulting system. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Caffau,  T.L. Campante,  G.R. Davies,  T. Kallinger,  M.N. Lund,  B. Mosser,  A. Baglin,  S. Mathur,  R. Garcia;  A large set of stars observed by CoRoT and Kepler shows clear evidence for the presence of a stellar background, which is interpreted to arise from surface convection, i.e., granulation. These observations show that the characteristic time-scale (tau_eff) and the root-mean-square (rms) brightness fluctuations (sigma) associated with the granulation scale as a function of the peak frequency (nu_max) of the solar-like oscillations. We aim at providing a theoretical background to the observed scaling relations based on a model developed in the companion paper. We computed for each 3D model the theoretical power density spectrum (PDS) associated with the granulation as seen in disk-integrated intensity on the basis of the theoretical model. For each PDS we derived tau_eff and sigma and compared these theoretical values with the theoretical scaling relations derived from the theoretical model and the Kepler measurements. We derive theoretical scaling relations for tau_eff and sigma, which show the same dependence on nu_max as the observed scaling relations. In addition, we show that these quantities also scale as a function of the turbulent Mach number (Ma) estimated at the photosphere. The theoretical scaling relations for tau_eff and sigma match the observations well on a global scale. Our modelling provides additional theoretical support for the observed variations of sigma and tau_eff with nu_m max. It also highlights the important role of Ma in controlling the properties of the stellar granulation. However, the observations made with Kepler on a wide variety of stars cannot confirm the dependence of our scaling relations on Ma. Measurements of the granulation background and detections of solar-like oscillations in a statistically sufficient number of cool dwarf stars will be required for confirming the dependence of the theoretical scaling relations with Ma. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Near-infrared colors and medium resolution (R~2000-4000) spectroscopy establish the uniqueness of this system as a high-gravity, low-metallicity benchmark. Although there are a number of low-metallicity T dwarfs in the literature, WISE J200520.38+542433.9 has the most extreme inferred metallicity to date with [Fe/H] = -0.64 +/- 0.17 based on Wolf 1130. Model comparisons to this exemplar late-type subdwarf support it having an old age, a low metallicity, and a small radius.

Gallego;  Catalogues and other records of aurora-borealis events were used to study the long-term spatial and temporal variation of these phenomena in the period from 1700 to 1905 in the Northern Hemisphere. For this purpose, geographic and geomagnetic coordinates were assigned to approximately 27 000 auroral events with more than 80 000 observations. They were analysed separately in three large-scale areas: i) Europe and North Africa, ii) North America, and iii) Asia. There was a clear need to fill some gaps existing in the records so as to have a reliable proxy of solar activity, especially during the 18th century. In order to enhance the long-term variability, an 11-year smoothing window was applied to the data. Variations in the cumulative numbers of auroral events with latitude (in both geographic and geomagnetic coordinates) were used to discriminate between the two main solar sources: coronal mass ejections and high-speed streams from coronal holes. The characteristics of the associated aurorae correlate differently with the solar-activity cycle. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Space Physics (physics.space-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.1540;Nitrogen Abundances and the Distance Moduli of the Pleiades and Hyades; Blake Miller,  Jeremy R. King,  Yu Chen,  Ann M. Boesgaard;"  Recent reanalyses of HIPPARCOS parallax data confirm a previously noted discrepancy with the Pleiades distance modulus estimated from main-sequence fitting in the color-magnitude diagram. One proposed explanation of this distance modulus discrepancy is a Pleiades He abundance that is significantly larger than the Hyades value. We suggest that, based on our theoretical and observational understanding of Galactic chemical evolution, nitrogen abundances may serve as a proxy for helium abundances of disk stars. Utilizing high-resolution near-UV Keck/HIRES spectroscopy, we determine N abundances in the Pleiades and Hyades dwarfs from NH features in the 3330 Ang region. While our Hyades N abundances show a modest 0.2 dex trend over a 800 K Teff range, we find the Pleiades N abundance (by number) is 0.13+/-0.05 dex lower than in the Hyades for stars in a smaller overlapping Teff range around 6000 K; possible systematic errors in the lower Pleiades N abundance result are estimated to be at the <0.10 dex level. Our results indicate [N/Fe]=0 for both the Pleiades and Hyades, consistent with the ratios exhibited by local Galactic disk field stars in other studies. If N production is a reliable tracer of He production in the disk, then our results suggest the Pleiades He abundance is no larger than that in the Hyades. This finding is supported by the relative Pleiades-Hyades C, O, and Fe abundances interpreted in the current context of Galactic chemical evolution, and is resistant to the effects on our derived N abundances of a He abundance difference like that needed to explain the Pleiades distance modulus discrepancy. A physical explanation of the Pleiades distance modulus discrepancy does not appear to be related to He abundance. ";Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Toot;"  We report an unusual set of observations of waves in a large prominence pillar which consist of pulses propagating perpendicular to the prominence magnetic field. We observe a huge quiescent prominence with the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) in EUV on 2012 October 10 and only a part of it, the pillar, which is a foot or barb of the prominence, with the Hinode Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) (in Ca II and H\alpha lines), Sac Peak (in H\alpha, H\beta\ and Na-D lines), THEMIS (""T\'elescope H\'eliographique pour l' Etude du Magn\'etisme et des Instabilit\'es Solaires"") with the MTR (MulTi-Raies) spectropolarimeter (in He D_3 line). The THEMIS/MTR data indicates that the magnetic field in the pillar is essentially horizontal and the observations in the optical domain show a large number of horizontally aligned features on a much smaller scale than the pillar as a whole. The data is consistent with a model of cool prominence plasma trapped in the dips of horizontal field lines. The SOT and Sac Peak data over the 4 hour observing period show vertical oscillations appearing as wave pulses. These pulses, which include a Doppler signature, move vertically, perpendicular to the field direction, along thin quasi-vertical columns in the much broader pillar. The pulses have a velocity of propagation of about 10 km/s, a period about 300 sec, and a wavelength around 2000 km. We interpret these waves in terms of fast magneto-sonic waves and discuss possible wave drivers. ";Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.1584;Galactic Evolved Massive Stars Discovered by Their Infrared Emission; A. P. Marston,  J. Mauerhan,  S. Van Dyk,  M. Cohen,  P. Morris;"  Determining the Galactic distribution and numbers of massive stars, such as Wolf-Rayet stars (WRs), is hampered by intervening Galactic or local circumstellar dust obscuration. In order to probe such regions of the Galaxy we can use infrared observations, which provide a means for finding such hidden populations through the dust. The availability of both 2MASS and Spitzer/GLIMPSE large-scale survey data provides infrared colours from 1.25 to 8$\mu$m for a large fraction of the inner Galactic plane. In 2005 we initiated a pilot study of the combined set of infrared colours for two GLIMPSE fields and showed that WRs typically occupy a sparsely populated region of the colour space. We followed up 42 of our WR candidates spectroscopically in the near-infrared, and with limited additional observations of some of these candidates in the optical. Six new WRs, four late-type WN and two late-type WC stars, were discovered as a result. Of the remaining $\sim$86% of the sample, five appear to be O-type stars. 21 stars are likely of type Be, and 10 stars appear to be of late-type, or possibly young stellar objects, which have ""contaminated"" the infrared color space. The survey is generally unbiased towards clusters or field stars, and the new WRs found are in both the field and in and around the RCW 49 region (including cluster Westerlund 2). In this work, and in our other recent work, we show that the infrared broad-band colours to be the most efficient means of identifying (particularly, dust-obscured) candidate massive stars, notably WRs.

The SDD data allow, in particular, the differential study of the leading and following parts with a temporal resolution of 1.5 hours. In this study, we analyse the equilibrium distance of sunspot groups as well as the evolution of this distance over the lifetime of the groups and the shifts in longitude associated with these groups. We also study the asymmetry between the compactness of the leading and following parts, as well as the time-profiles for the development of the area of sunspot groups. A logarithmic relationship has been found between the total area and the distance of leading-following parts of active regions (ARs) at the time of their maximum area. In the developing phase the leading part moves forward; this is more noticeable in larger ARs. The leading part has a higher growth rate than the trailing part in most cases in the developing phase. The growth rates of the sunspot groups depend linearly on their maximum total umbral area. There is an asymmetry in compactness: the number of spots tends to be smaller, while their mean area is larger in the leading part at the maximum phase. ";Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.1620;Stellar granulation as seen in disk-integrated intensity. I. Simplified  theoretical modeling; R. Samadi,  K. Belkacem,  H.-G. Ludwig;  The solar granulation is known for a long time to be a surface manifestation of convection. Thanks to the current space-borne missions CoRoT and Kepler, it is now possible to observe in disk-integrated intensity the signature of this phenomena in a growing number of stars. The space-based photometric measurements show that the global brightness fluctuations and the lifetime associated with granulation obeys characteristic scaling relations. We thus aim at providing a simple theoretical modeling to reproduce these scaling relations and subsequently at inferring the physical properties of granulation properties across the HR diagram. We develop a simple 1D theoretical model that enable us to test any prescription concerning the time-correlation between granules. The input parameters of the model are extracted from 3D hydrodynamical models of the surface layers of stars, and the free parameters involved in the model are calibrated with solar observations. Two different prescriptions for representing the eddy time-correlation in the Fourier space are compared: a Lorentzian and an exponential form. Finally, we compare our theoretical prediction with a 3D radiative hydrodynamical (RHD) numerical modeling of stellar granulation (ab-initio approach). Provided that the free parameters are appropriately adjusted, our theoretical model satisfactorily reproduces the shape and the amplitude of the observed solar granulation spectrum. The best agreement is obtained with an exponential form. Furthermore, our theoretical model results in granulation spectra that consistently agree with the these calculated on the basis of the ab-initio approach with two 3D RHD models. Comparison between theoretical granulation spectra calculated with the present model and high precision photometry measurements of stellar granulation is undertaken in a companion paper. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Leconte (LMD),  Alban Sauret (IRPHE);  Several studies have already considered the influence of tides on the evolution of systems composed of a star and a close-in companion to tentatively explain different observations such as the spin-up of some stars with hot Jupiters, the radius anomaly of short orbital period planets and the synchronization or quasi-synchronization of the stellar spin in some extreme cases. However, the nature of the mechanism responsible for the tidal dissipation in such systems remains uncertain. In this paper, we claim that the so-called elliptical instability may play a major role in these systems, explaining some systematic features present in the observations. This hydrodynamic instability, arising in rotating flows with elliptical streamlines, is suspected to be present in both planet and star of such systems, which are elliptically deformed by tides. The presence and the influence of the elliptical instability in gaseous bodies, such as stars or hot Jupiters, are most of the time neglected. In this paper, using numerical simulations and theoretical arguments, we consider several features associated to the elliptical instability in hot-Jupiter systems. In particular, the use of ad hoc boundary conditions makes it possible to estimate the amplitude of the elliptical instability in gaseous bodies. We also consider the influence of compressibility on the elliptical instability, and compare the results to the incompressible case. We demonstrate the ability for the elliptical instability to grow in the presence of differential rotation, with a possible synchronized latitude, provided that the tidal deformation and/or the rotation rate of the fluid are large enough. Moreover, the amplitude of the instability for a centrally-condensed mass of fluid is of the same order of magnitude as for an incompressible fluid for a given distance to the threshold of the instability. Finally, we show that the assumption of the elliptical instability being the main tidal dissipation process in eccentric inflated hot Jupiters and misaligned stars is consistent with current data. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)"

After identification in a 2011 search of the SuperWASP archive for main-sequence eclipsing binary candidates near the distribution's short-period limit of approx. 0.20 d, it was measured to be undergoing rapid period decrease in our earlier work, though later observations supported a cyclic variation in period length. Spectroscopic data obtained in 2012 with the Southern African Large Telescope did not, however, support the interpretation of the object as a normal eclipsing binary. Here, we consider three possible explanations consistent with the data: a single-star oblique rotator model in which variability results from stable cool spots on opposite magnetic poles; a two-star model in which the secondary is a brown dwarf; and a three-star model involving a low-mass eclipsing binary in a hierarchical triple system. We conclude that the latter is the most likely model. ";Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Since the most interesting period of planet formation overlaps with the age of these groups, their well dated members are attractive targets for exoplanet searches by direct imaging. We combined astrometric, photometric and X-ray data, and applied strict selection criteria to explore the stellar content of five nearby moving groups. We identified more than 100 potential new candidate members in the {\ss} Pic moving group, and in the Tucana-Horologium, Columba, Carina, and Argus associations.

We identified 35 new probable/possible young moving group members: 4 in the {\ss} Pic moving group, 11 in the Columba association, 16 in the Carina association, and 4 in the Argus association. We found serendipitiously a new AB Dor moving group member as well.

Grady,  Th. Henning,  A. Juhász,  Cs. Kiss,  I. Pascucci,  J. Szulágyi,  R. Vavrek;  Recently, a new planet candidate was discovered on direct images around the young (10-17 Myr) A-type star HD95086. The strong infrared excess of the system indicates that, similarly to HR8799, {\ss} Pic, and Fomalhaut, the star harbors a circumstellar disk. Aiming to study the structure and gas content of the HD95086 disk, and to investigate its possible interaction with the newly discovered planet, here we present new optical, infrared and millimeter observations. We detected no CO emission, excluding the possibility of an evolved gaseous primordial disk. Simple blackbody modeling of the spectral energy distribution suggests the presence of two spatially separate dust belts at radial distances of 6 and 64 AU. Our resolved images obtained with the Herschel Space Observatory reveal a characteristic disk size of ~6.0x5.4 arcsec (540x490 AU) and disk inclination of ~25 degree. Assuming the same inclination for the planet candidate's orbit, its re-projected radial distance from the star is 62 AU, very close to the blackbody radius of the outer cold dust ring. The structure of the planetary system at HD95086 resembles the one around HR8799. Both systems harbor a warm inner dust belt and a broad colder outer disk and giant planet(s) between the two dusty regions. Modelling implies that the candidate planet can dynamically excite the motion of planetesimals even out to 270 AU via their secular perturbation if its orbital eccentricity is larger than about 0.4. Our analysis adds a new example to the three known systems where directly imaged planet(s) and debris disks co-exist. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)"

Images behind the limb from STEREO-A show a two ribbon flare and the interaction of the main filament, located along the primary neutral line, with an arch-like structure, oriented in the perpendicular direction. The interaction was accompanied by strong emission and twisting motions. The microwave images show a low temperature component, a high temperature component associated with the interaction of the two filaments and another high temperature component apparently associated with the top of flare loops. We computed the differential emission measure from the high temperature AIA bands and from this the expected microwave brightness temperature; for the emission associated with the top of flare loops the computed brightness was 35% lower than the observed.

Young;  Solar filaments exhibit a range of eruptive-like dynamic activity, ranging from the full or partial eruption of the filament mass and surrounding magnetic structure as a coronal mass ejection (CME), to a fully confined or 'failed' eruption. On 2011 June 7, a dramatic partial eruption of a filament was observed by multiple instruments on SDO and STEREO. One of the interesting aspects of this event is the response of the solar atmosphere as non-escaping material falls inward under the influence of gravity. The impact sites show clear evidence of brightening in the observed EUV wavelengths due to energy release. Two plausible physical mechanisms explaining the brightening are considered: heating of the plasma due to the kinetic energy of impacting material compressing the plasma, or reconnection between the magnetic field of low-lying loops and the field carried by the impacting material. By analyzing the emission of the brightenings in several SDO/AIA wavelengths, and comparing the kinetic energy of the impacting material (7.6 x 10^26 - 5.8 x 10^27 ergs) to the radiative energy (1.9 x 10^25 - 2.5 x 10^26 ergs) we find the dominant mechanism of energy release involved in the observed brightening is plasma compression. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Harding;  We use Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope detections and upper limits on non-recycled pulsars obtained from the Large Area Telescope (LAT) to constrain how the gamma-ray luminosity L depends on the period P and the period derivative \dot{P}. We use a Bayesian analysis to calculate a best-fit luminosity law, or dependence of L on P and \dot{P}, including different methods for modeling the beaming factor. An outer gap (OG) magnetosphere geometry provides the best-fit model, which is L \propto P^{-a} \dot{P}^{b} where a=1.36\pm0.03 and b=0.44\pm0.02, similar to but not identical to the commonly assumed L \propto \sqrt{\dot{E}} \propto P^{-1.5} \dot{P}^{0.5}. Given upper limits on gamma-ray fluxes of currently known radio pulsars and using the OG model, we find that about 92% of the radio-detected pulsars have gamma-ray beams that intersect our line of sight. By modeling the misalignment of radio and gamma-ray beams of these pulsars, we find an average gamma-ray beaming solid angle of about 3.7{\pi} for the OG model, assuming a uniform beam. Using LAT-measured diffuse fluxes, we place a 2{\sigma} upper limit on the average braking index and a 2{\sigma} lower limit on the average surface magnetic field strength of the pulsar population of 3.8 and 3.2 X 10^{10} G, respectively. We then predict the number of non-recycled pulsars detectable by the LAT based on our population model. Using the two-year sensitivity, we find that the LAT is capable of detecting emission from about 380 non-recycled pulsars, including 150 currently identified radio pulsars. Using the expected five-year sensitivity, about 620 non-recycled pulsars are detectable, including about 220 currently identified radio pulsars. We note that these predictions significantly depend on our model assumptions. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)"

The comparison with the reference star enables us to substantially enhance the scientific output for HD 175272. First, we determined its global characteristics through a detailed seismic analysis of HD 181420. Second, with our differential approach, we measured the difference of mass, radius and age between HD 175272 and HD 181420. We have developed a general method able to derive asteroseismic constraints on a star even in case of low-quality data. %This method is based on the comparison to a star with common seismic and classical properties.

This method can be applied to stars with interesting properties but low signal-to-noise ratio oscillation spectrum, such as stars hosting an exoplanet or members of a binary system. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.2019;Alfvén waves in simulations of solar photospheric vortices; S. Shelyag,  P.S. Cally,  A. Reid,  M. Mathioudakis;"  Using advanced numerical magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of the magnetised solar photosphere, including non-grey radiative transport and a non-ideal equation of state, we analyse plasma motions in photospheric magnetic vortices. We demonstrate that apparent vortex-like motions in photospheric magnetic field concentrations do not exhibit ""tornado""-like behaviour or a ""bath-tub"" effect. While at each time instance the velocity field lines in the upper layers of the solar photosphere show swirls, the test particles moving with the time-dependent velocity field do not demonstrate such structures. Instead, they move in a wave-like fashion with rapidly changing and oscillating velocity field, determined mainly by magnetic tension in the magnetised intergranular downflows. Using time-distance diagrams, we identify horizontal motions in the magnetic flux tubes as torsional Alfv\'en perturbations propagating along the nearly vertical magnetic field lines with local Alfv\'en speed.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.2046;Obscuration of Flare Emission by an Eruptive Prominence; Nat Gopalswamy,  Seiji Yashiro;  We report on the eclipsing of microwave flare emission by an eruptive prominence from a neighboring region as observed by the Nobeyama Radioheliograph at 17 GHz. The obscuration of the flare emission appears as a dimming feature in the microwave flare light curve. We use the dimming feature to derive the temperature of the prominence and the distribution of heating along the length of the filament. We find that the prominence is heated to a temperature above the quiet Sun temperature at 17 GHz. The duration of the dimming is the time taken by the eruptive prominence in passing over the flaring region. We also find evidence for the obscuration in EUV images obtained by the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) mission. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.2062;Injection of thermal and suprathermal seed particles into coronal shocks  of varying obliquity; Markus Battarbee,  Rami Vainio,  Timo Laitinen,  Heli Hietala;  Context: Diffusive shock acceleration in the solar corona can accelerate solar energetic particles to very high energies. Acceleration efficiency is increased by entrapment through self-generated waves, which is highly dependent on the amount of accelerated particles. This, in turn, is determined by the efficiency of particle injection into the acceleration process. Aims: We present an analysis of the injection efficiency at coronal shocks of varying obliquity. We assessed injection through reflection and downstream scattering, including the effect of a cross-shock potential. Both quasi-thermal and suprathermal seed populations were analysed. We present results on the effect of cross-field diffusion downstream of the shock on the injection efficiency. Methods: Using analytical methods, we present applicable injection speed thresholds that were compared with both semi-analytical flux integration and Monte Carlo simulations, which do not resort to binary thresholds. Shock-normal angle and shock-normal velocity were varied to assess the injection efficiency with respect to these parameters. Results: We present evidence of a significant bias of thermal seed particle injection at small shock-normal angles. We show that downstream isotropisation methods affect the theta-dependence of this result. We show a non-negligible effect caused by the cross-shock potential, and that the effect of downstream cross-field diffusion is highly dependent on boundary definitions. Conclusions: Our results show that for Monte Carlo simulations of coronal shock acceleration a full distribution function assessment with downstream isotropisation through scatterings is necessary to realistically model particle injection. Based on our results, seed particle injection at quasi-parallel coronal shocks can result in significant acceleration efficiency, especially when combined with varying field-line geometry. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.2095;UV diagnostic of porosity-free mass-loss estimates in B stars; Raman Prinja,  Derck Massa;"  We seek to establish evidence in UV P Cygni line profiles that the signs of wind clumping and porosity vary with velocity. We aim to demonstrate empirically that while at most wind velocities optically thick clumps cover only a fraction of the stellar surface, close to the terminal velocity where narrow absorption components (NACs) appear in UV lines the covering factor is approximately unity. SEI line-synthesis models are used to determine the radial optical depths of blue and red components of the SiIV 1400 resonance line doublet in a sample of 12 B0 to B4 supergiants. We focus on stars with well developed NACs and relatively low terminal velocity so that the SiIV doublet components can be treated as radiatively decoupled and formed independently. For all 12 stars the mean optical depth ratio of the blue to red components is closer to ~ 2 (i.e. the ratio of oscillator strengths) in the NACs than at intermediate and lower velocities. The product of mass-loss rate and Si^3+ ion fraction calculated from the NAC optical depths is a factor of ~ 2 to 9 higher compared to mass-loss values sampled at ~ 0.4 to 0.6 of the terminal velocity. Since the wind effectively becomes `smooth' at the high NAC velocities and the column density is uniformly distributed over the stellar disk, the optical depths of the NACs are not seriously affected by porosity and this feature thus provides the most reliable measurement of mass-loss rate in the UV lines. Applications of this result to the weak-wind problem of late O-dwarf stars and the ""PV mass loss discordance"" in early O supergiants are discussed. ";Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.2114;Phase lags of solar hemispheric cycles; J. Muraközy,  A. Ludmány;  The North-South asymmetry of solar activity is variable in time and strength. We analyse the long-term variation of the phase lags of hemispheric cycles and check a conjectured relationship between these phase lags and the hemispheric cycle strengths. Sunspot data are used from cycles 12-23 in which the separation of northern and southern hemispheres is possible. The centers of mass of the hemispheric cycle profiles were used to study the phase relations and relative strengths of the hemispheric cycles. This approach considers a cycle as a whole and disregards the short-term fluctuations of the cycle time profile. The phase of the hemispheric cycles shows an alternating variation: the northern cycle leads in 4 cycles and follows in 4 cycles. No significant relationship is found between the phase and strength differences of the hemispheric cycles. The period of 4+4 cycles appears to be close to the Gleissberg cycle and may provide a key to its physical background. It may raise a new aspect in the solar dynamo mechanism because it needs a very long memory. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Hogerheijde (2),  O. Panic (3),  J.M. Brown (4),  Th. Henning (5) ((1) MPE, (2) Leiden Observatory, (3) University of Cambridge, (4) CfA, (5) MPIA);  Herschel/HIFI spectroscopic observations of CO J=10-9, CO J=16-15 and [CII] towards HD 100546 are presented. The objective is to resolve the velocity profile of the lines to address the emitting region of the transitions and directly probe the distribution of warm gas in the disk. The spectra reveal double-peaked CO line profiles centered on the systemic velocity, consistent with a disk origin. The J=16-15 line profile is broader than that of the J=10-9 line, which in turn is broader than those of lower J transitions (6-5, 3-2, observed with APEX), thus showing a clear temperature gradient of the gas with radius. A power-law flat disk model is used to fit the CO line profiles and the CO rotational ladder simultaneously, yielding a temperature of T_0=1100 \pm 350 K (at r_0 = 13 AU) and an index of q=0.85 \pm 0.1 for the temperature radial gradient. This indicates that the gas has a steeper radial temperature gradient than the dust (mean q_{dust} ~ 0.5), providing further proof of the thermal decoupling of gas and dust at the disk heights where the CO lines form. The [CII] line profile shows a strong single-peaked profile red-shifted by 0.5 km s-1 compared to the systemic velocity. We conclude that the bulk of the [CII] emission has a non-disk origin (e.g., remnant envelope or diffuse cloud). ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)"

We find a wide dispersion in the amplitude of the photometric variability as a function of rotation, likely indicating differences in the spot distribution among stars. We use these rotation periods in combination with published spectroscopic measurements of vsini and stellar parameters to derive the stellar inclination in the line-of-sight, and find a number of systems with possible spin-orbit misalignment. We additionally find several systems with close-in planet candidates whose stellar rotation periods are equal to or twice the planetary orbital period, indicative of possible tidal interactions between these planets and their parent stars. If these systems survive validation to become confirmed planets, they will provide important clues to the evolutionary history of these systems. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.2186;A Solar Dynamo Model Driven by Mean-Field Alpha and Babcock-Leighton  Sources: Fluctuations, Grand-Minima-Maxima and Hemispheric Asymmetry in  Sunspot Cycles; D. Passos,  D. Nandy,  S. Hazra,  I. Lopes;  Extreme solar activity fluctuations and the occurrence of solar grand minima and maxima episodes, are well established, observed features of the solar cycle. Nevertheless, such extreme activity fluctuations and the dynamics of the solar cycle during Maunder minima-like episodes remain ill-understood. We explore the origin of such extreme solar activity fluctuations and the role of dual poloidal field sources, namely the Babcock-Leighton mechanism and the mean-field alpha effect in the dynamics of the solar cycle. We mainly concentrate on entry and recovery from grand minima episodes such as the Maunder minimum and the dynamics of the solar cycle. We use a kinematic solar dynamo model with a novel set-up in which stochastic perturbations force two distinct poloidal field alpha effects. We explore different regimes of operation of these poloidal sources with distinct operating thresholds, to identify the importance of each. The perturbations are implemented independently in both hemispheres which allows one to study the level of hemispheric coupling and hemispheric asymmetry in the emergence of sunspots. From the simulations performed we identify a few different ways in which the dynamo can enter a grand minima episode. While fluctuations in any of the $\alpha$ effects can trigger intermittency we find that the mean-field alpha effect is crucial for the recovery of the solar cycle from a grand minima episode which a Babcock-Leighton source alone, fails to achieve. Our simulations also demonstrate other cycle dynamics. We conclude that stochastic fluctuations in two interacting poloidal field sources working with distinct operating thresholds is a viable candidate for triggering episodes of extreme solar activity and that the mean-field alpha effect capable of working on weak, sub-equipartition fields is critical to the recovery of the solar cycle following an extended solar minimum. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

The discovery of short activity cycles in a few stars, and the recognition of analogous variability in the Sun, suggest that there may be two distinct dynamos operating in different regions of the interior. Consequently, there is a natural link between studies of magnetic activity and asteroseismology, which can characterize some of the internal properties that are relevant to dynamos. I provide a brief historical overview of the connection between these two fields (including prescient work by Wojtek Dziembowski in 2007), and I highlight some exciting results that are beginning to emerge from the Kepler mission. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

These observations used the VLBA at {\lambda}=7mm and {\lambda}=3mm over two epochs. The goal is to use the relative characteristics and spatial distribution of the transitions in individual resolved maser components to provide observational constraints on SiO maser excitation and pumping models. We find that many v=1 J=1-0 and v=2 J=1-0 features overlap in the second observing epoch, at comparable sensitivity. The v=2 J=1-0 emission is primarily located within several v=1 J=1-0 regions, and has a high degree of morphological similarity in the northeastern envelope, supportive of local collisional pumping. We find significantly higher spatial overlap between v=1 J=1-0 and J=2-1 features than generally previously reported. However, the overlapping v=1 J=2-1 emission is usually weaker than predicted by hydrodynamical models, possibly due to low-density collisional pumping. The overall maser morphology contains several large-scale features that are persistent over multiple years and are likely associated with intrinsic physical circumstellar conditions. Our data cannot distinguish between competing near-circumstellar bulk kinematic models but do provide evidence for localized inhomogeneous mass-loss. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Vasileiades (1 and 2) (Niels Bohr Institute, Univ. of Copenhagen (1), Centre for Star and Planet Formation, Univ. of Copenhagen (2), ICREA and ICC, Univ. of Barcelona (3));  We use the adaptive mesh refinement code RAMSES to model the formation of protoplanetary disks in realistic star formation environments. The resolution scales over up to 29 powers of two ($\sim$ 9 orders of magnitude) covering a range from outer scales of 40 pc to inner scales of 0.015 AU. The accretion rate from a 1.5 solar mass envelope peaks near $10^{-4}$ $\mspy$ about 6 kyr after sink particle formation and then decays approximately exponentially, reaching $10^{-6}$ $\mspy$ in 100 kyr. The models suggest universal scalings of physical properties with radius during the main accretion phase, with kinetic and / or magnetic energy in approximate balance with gravitational energy. Efficient accretion is made possible by the braking action of the magnetic field, which nevertheless allows a near-Keplerian disk to grow to a 100 AU size. The magnetic field strength ranges from more than 10 G at 0.1 AU to less than 1 mG at 100 AU, and drives a time dependent bipolar outflow, with a collimated jet and a broader disk wind. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.2294;Turbulent entrainment origin of protostellar outflows; Guang-Xing Li,  Keping Qiu,  Friedrich Wyrowski,  Karl Menten;  Protostellar outflow is a prominent process that accompanies the formation of stars. It is generally agreed that wide-angled protostellar outflows come from the interaction between the wind from a forming star and the ambient gas. However, it is still unclear how the interaction takes place. In this work, we theoretically investigate the possibility that the outflow results from interaction between the wind and the ambient gas in the form of turbulent entrainment. In contrast to the previous models, turbulent motion of the ambient gas around the protostar is taken into account. In our model, the ram-pressure of the wind balances the turbulent ram-pressure of the ambient gas, and the outflow consists of the ambient gas entrained by the wind. The calculated outflow from our modelling exhibits a conical shape. The total mass of the outflow is determined by the turbulent velocity of the envelope as well as the outflow age, and the velocity of the outflow is several times higher than the velocity dispersion of the ambient gas. The outflow opening angle increases with the strength of the wind and decreases with the increasing ambient gas turbulence. The outflow exhibits a broad line width at every position. We propose that the turbulent entrainment process, which happens ubiquitously in nature, plays a universal role in shaping protostellar outflows. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)"

Torres et al. defined the Octans Association as a group of 15 stars with age ""20 Myr?"" and located ~140 pc from Earth, but with average V space velocity -3.6 km/s that is well outside of the good box. We present a list of 14 Hipparcos star systems within 100 pc of Earth that we call ""Octans-Near""; these systems have UVW similar to those of the much more distant Octans Association. The Octans-Near stars have apparent ages between about 30 and 100 Myr and their relationship to the Octans Association stars is unclear. Six additional star systems have UVW similar to those of Octans-Near stars and likely ages <200 Myr. These six systems include the late-type binary star EQ Peg -- 6.2 pc from Earth with likely age <100 Myr and thus likely to be the nearest known pre-main sequence star system. The UVW of stars in a previously proposed ~200 Myr old Castor moving group are not too dissimilar from the UVW of Octans-Near stars. However, stars in the Castor group -- if it exists at all -- are mostly substantially older than 200 Myr and thus generally can readily be distinguished from the much younger Octans-Near stars.

Roepke,  Ashley J. Ruiter,  Ruediger Pakmor;  Context: Manganese is predominantly synthesised in Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) explosions. Owing to the entropy dependence of the Mn yield in explosive thermonuclear burning, SNe Ia involving near Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs (WDs) are predicted to produce Mn to Fe ratios significantly exceeding those of SN Ia explosions involving sub-Chandrasekhar mass primary WDs. Of all current supernova explosion models, only SN Ia models involving near-Chandrasekhar mass WDs produce [Mn/Fe] > 0.0. Aims: Using the specific yields for competing SN Ia scenarios, we aim to constrain the relative fractions of exploding near-Chandrasekhar mass to sub-Chandrasekhar mass primary WDs in the Galaxy. Methods: We extract the Mn yields from three-dimensional thermonuclear supernova simulations referring to different initial setups and progenitor channels. We then compute the chemical evolution of Mn in the Solar neighborhood, assuming SNe Ia are made up of different relative fractions of the considered explosion models. Results: We find that due to the entropy dependence of freeze-out yields from nuclear statistical equilibrium, [Mn/Fe] strongly depends on the mass of the exploding WD, with near-Chandraskher mass WDs producing substantially higher [Mn/Fe] than sub-Chandrasekhar mass WDs. Of all nucleosynthetic sources potentially influencing the chemical evolution of Mn, only explosion models involving the thermonuclear incineration of near-Chandrasekhar mass WDs predict solar or super-solar [Mn/Fe]. Consequently, we find in our chemical evolution calculations that the observed [Mn/Fe] in the Solar neighborhood at [Fe/H] > 0.0 cannot be reproduced without near-Chandrasekhar mass SN Ia primaries. Assuming that 50 per cent of all SNe Ia stem from explosive thermonuclear burning in near-Chandrasekhar mass WDs results in a good match to data. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Higuchi (JAO);  We present the results of N$_2$H$^+$ ($J=1-0$) observations toward Serpens South, the nearest cluster-forming, infrared dark cloud. The physical quantities are derived by fitting the hyperfine structure of N$_2$H$^+$. The Herschel and 1.1-mm continuum maps show that a pc-scale filament fragments into three clumps with radii of $0.1-0.2$ pc and masses of $40-230M_\odot$. We find that the clumps contain smaller-scale ($\sim 0.04$ pc) structures, i.e., dense cores. We identify 70 cores by applying CLUMPFIND to the N$_2$H$^+$ data cube. In the central cluster-forming clump, the excitation temperature and line-width tend to be large, presumably due to protostellar outflow feedback and stellar radiation. However, for all the clumps, the virial ratios are evaluated to be $0.1-0.3$, indicating that the internal motions play only a minor role in the clump support. The clumps exhibit no free-fall, but low-velocity infall, and thus the clumps should be supported by additional forces. The most promising force is the globally-ordered magnetic field observed toward this region. We propose that the Serpens South filament was close to magnetically-critical and ambipolar diffusion triggered the cluster formation. We find that the northern clump, which shows no active star formation, has a mass and radius comparable to the central cluster-forming clump, and therefore, it is a likely candidate of a {\it pre-protocluster clump}. The initial condition for cluster formation is likely to be a magnetically-supported clump of cold, quiescent gas. This appears to contradict the accretion-driven turbulence scenario, for which the turbulence in the clumps is maintained by the accretion flow. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)"

Included in this total are 340 newly discovered dwarf Cepheids which are mostly located ~2.5 magnitudes below the horizontal branch and have very short periods (<0.1 days) typical of their class and consistent with their location on the upper part of the extended main sequence of the younger populations of the galaxy. Several extra-tidal dwarf cepheids were found in our survey up to a distance of ~1 degree from the center of Carina. Our sample also includes RR Lyrae stars and anomalous Cepheids some of which were found outside the galaxy's tidal radius as well. This supports past works that suggests Carina is undergoing tidal disruption. We use the period-luminosity relationship for dwarf Cepheids to estimate a distance modulus of 20.17 +/- 0.10 mags, in very good agreement with the estimate from RR Lyrae stars. We find some important differences in the properties of the dwarf Cepheids of Carina and those in Fornax and the LMC, the only extragalactic samples of dwarf Cepheids currently known. These differences may reflect a metallicity spread, depth along the line of sight and/or, different evolutionary paths of the dwarf Cepheid stars. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)"

We have found a young outflow toward the center of this clump in the SiO, CS, and CH3OH lines. This outflow is likely driven by a protostar embedded in a hot core, which is traced by the CH3CH2CN, HCOOCH3, 13CS, and high excitation CH3OH lines. The size of the hot core is about 800 x 300 AU in spite of its low mass (<1.1 M_sun), suggesting a high accretion rate or the presence of multiple star system harboring a few hot corinos. The outflow is highly collimated, and the dynamical timescale is estimated to be less than 740 yr. In addition, we have also detected extended emission of SiO, CS, and CH3OH, which is not associated with the hot core and the outflow. This emission may be related to past star formation activity in the clump. Although G34.43+00.24 MM3 is surrounded by a dark feature in infrared, it has already experienced active formation of low-mass stars in an early stage of clump evolution. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.2812;Large-scale Magnetic Structure Formation in 3D-MHD Turbulence; Shiva Kumar Malapaka,  Wolf-Christian Müller;  The inverse cascade of magnetic helicity in 3D-MHD turbulence is believed to be one of the processes responsible for large scale magnetic structure formation in astrophysical systems. In this work we present an exhaustive set of high resolution direct numerical simulations (DNS) of both forced and decaying 3D-MHD turbulence, to understand this structure formation process. It is first shown that an inverse cascade of magnetic helicity in small-scale driven turbulence does not necessarily generate coherent large-scale magnetic structures. The observed large-scale magnetic field, in this case, is severely perturbed by magnetic fluctuations generated by the small-scale forcing. In the decaying case, coherent large-scale structure form similar to those observed astronomically. Based on the numerical results the formation of large-scale magnetic structures in some astrophysical systems, is suggested to be the consequence of an initial forcing which imparts the necessary turbulent energy into the system, which, after the forcing shuts off, decays to form the large-scale structures.

Most of the kinematic dynamo simulations assume a one-cell structure of the meridional circulation within the convection zone, with the equatorward return flow at its bottom. In view of the recent claims that the return flow occurs at a much shallower depth, we explore whether a meridional circulation with such a shallow return flow can still retain the attractive features of the flux transport dynamo (such as a proper butterfly diagram, the proper phase relation between the toroidal and poloidal fields). We consider additional cells of the meridional circulation below the shallow return flow---both the case of multiple cells radially stacked above one another and the case of more complicated cell patterns. As long as there is an equatorward flow in low latitudes at the bottom of the convection zone, we find that the solar behavior is approximately reproduced. However, if there is either no flow or a poleward flow at the bottom of the convection zone, then we cannot reproduce solar behavior. On making the turbulent diffusivity low, we still find periodic behavior, although the period of the cycle becomes unrealistically large. Also, with a low diffusivity, we do not get the observed correlation between the polar field at the sunspot minimum and the strength of the next cycle, which is reproduced when diffusivity is high. On introducing radially downward pumping, we get a more reasonable period and more solar-like behavior even with low diffusivity. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.2868;Mass estimates for visual binaries with incomplete orbits; L.B. Lucy;  The problem of estimating the total mass of a visual binary when its orbit is incomplete is treated with Bayesian methods. The posterior mean of a mass estimator is approximated by a triple integral over orbital period, time of periastron and orbital eccentricity. This reduction to 3-D from the 7-D space defined by the conventional Campbell parameters is achieved by adopting the Thiele-Innes elements and exploiting the linearity with respect to the four Thiele-Innes constants. The formalism is tested on synthetic observational data covering a variable fraction of a model binary's orbit. The posterior mean of the mass estimator is numerically found to be unbiased when the data cover > 40% of the orbit. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.2899;Mapping a star with transits: orbit precession effects in the Kepler-13  system; Gy. M. Szabó,  A. E. Simon,  L. L. Kiss;  Kepler-13b (KOI-13.01) is a most intriguing exoplanet system due to the rapid precession rate, exhibiting several exotic phenomena. We analyzed $Kepler$ Short Cadence data up to Quarter 14, with a total time-span of 928 days, to reveal changes in transit duration, depth, asymmetry, and identify the possible signals of stellar rotation and low-level activity. We investigated long-term variations of transit light curves, testing for duration, peak depth and asymmetry. We also performed cluster analysis on $Kepler$ quarters. We computed the autocorrelation function of the out-of-transit light variations. Transit duration, peak depth, and asymmetry evolve slowly, due to the slowly drifting transit path through the stellar disk. The detected transit shapes will map the stellar surface on the time scale of decades. We found a very significant clustering pattern with 3-orbit period. Its source is very probably the rotating stellar surface, in the 5:3 spin-orbit resonance reported in a previous study. The autocorrelation function of the out-of-transit light variations, filtered to 25.4 hours and harmonics, shows slow variations and a peak around 300--360 day period, which could be related to the activity cycle of the host star. ;"Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)"

Vink;  Aims. Using ground based multi-object optical spectroscopy obtained in the framework of the VLT-FLAMES Tarantula Survey (VFTS), we aim to establish the (projected) rotational velocity distribution for a sample of 216 presumably single O-type stars in 30 Doradus (30 Dor). Methods. We measured projected rotational velocities, \vrot, by means of a Fourier transform method and a profile fitting method applied on a set of isolated spectral lines. We also used an iterative deconvolution procedure to infer the probability density, $\rm{P(\veq)}$, of the equatorial rotational velocity, \veq. Results. The distribution of \vrot\ shows a two-component structure: a peak around 80 \kms\ and a high-velocity tail extending up to $\sim$600 \kms. This structure is also present in the inferred distribution $\rm{P(\veq)}$ with around 80% of the sample having 0 $<$ \veq\, $\leq\, 300$ \kms\ and the other 20% distributed in the high-velocity region. Conclusions. Most of the stars in our sample rotate with a rate less than 20%\ of their break-up velocity. For the bulk of the sample, mass-loss in a stellar wind and/or envelope expansion is not efficient enough to significantly spin down these stars within the first few Myr of evolution. The presence of a sizeable population of fast rotators is compatible with recent population synthesis computations that investigate the influence of binary evolution on the rotation rate of massive stars. Despite the fact that we have excluded stars that show significant radial velocity variations, our sample may have remained contaminated by post-interaction binary products. The fact that the high-velocity tail may be preferentially (and perhaps even exclusively), populated by post-binary interaction products, has important implications for the evolutionary origin of systems that produce gamma-ray bursts. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.3019;Magnetohydrodynamics dynamical relaxation of coronal magnetic fields.  IV. 3D tilted nulls; Jorge Fuentes-Fernandez,  Clare E. Parnell;"  In this paper we study current accumulations in 3D ""tilted"" nulls formed by a folding of the spine and fan. A non-zero component of current parallel to the fan is required such that the null's fan plane and spine are not perpendicular. Our aims are to provide valid magnetohydrostatic equilibria and to describe the current accumulations in various cases involving finite plasma pressure.To create our equilibrium current structures we use a full, non-resistive, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code so that no reconnection is allowed. A series of experiments are performed in which a perturbed 3D tilted null relaxes towards an equilibrium via real, viscous damping forces. Changes to the initial plasma pressure and to magnetic parameters are investigated systematically.An initially tilted fan is associated with a non-zero Lorentz force that drives the fan and spine to collapse towards each other, in a similar manner to the collapse of a 2D X-point. In the final equilibrium state for an initially radial null with only the current perpendicular to the spine, the current concentrates along the tilt axis of the fan and in a layer about the null point with a sharp peak at the null itself. The continued growth of this peak indicates that the system is in an asymptotic regime involving an infinite time singularity at the null. When the initial tilt disturbance (current perpendicular to the spine) is combined with a spiral-type disturbance (current parallel to the spine), the final current density concentrates in three regions: one on the fan along its tilt axis and two around the spine, above and below the fan. The increased area of current accumulation leads to a weakening of the singularity formed at the null. The 3D spine-fan collapse with generic current studied here provides the ideal setup for non-steady reconnection studies. ";Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

Marques;  High-quality data from space-based observatories present an opportunity to fit stellar models to observations of individually-identified oscillation frequencies, not just the large and small frequency separations. But such fits require the evaluation of a large number of accurate stellar models, which remains expensive. Here, we show that global-mode oscillation frequencies interpolated in a grid of stellar models are precise and accurate, at least in the neighbourhood of a solar model. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.3063;Grand Minima and North-South Asymmetry of Solar Activity; S. V. Olemskoy,  L. L. Kitchatinov;  A solar-type dynamo model in a spherical shell is developed with allowance for random dependence of the poloidal field generation mechanism on time and latitude. The model shows repeatable epochs of strongly decreased amplitude of magnetic cycles similar to the Maunder minimum of solar activity. Random dependence of dynamo-parameters on latitude brakes the equatorial symmetry of generated fields. The model shows the correlation of the occurrence of grand minima with deviations in the dynamo-field from dipolar parity. An increased north-south asymmetry of magnetic activity can, therefore, be an indicator of transitions to grand minima. Qualitative interpretation of this correlation is suggested. Statistics of grand minima in the model are close to the Poisson random process indicating that the onset of a grand minimum is statistically independent of preceding minima. ;Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
