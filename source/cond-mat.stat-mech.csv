https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.0059;Nonuniform autonomous one-dimensional exclusion nearest-neighbor  reaction-diffusion models; Amir Aghamohammadi,  Mohammad Khorrami;  The most general nonuniform reaction-diffusion models on a one-dimensional lattice with boundaries, for which the time evolution equations of corre- lation functions are closed, are considered. A transfer matrix method is used to find the static solution. It is seen that this transfer matrix can be obtained in a closed form, if the reaction rates satisfy certain conditions. We call such models superautonomous. Possible static phase transitions of such models are investigated. At the end, as an example of superau- tonomous models, a nonuniform voter model is introduced, and solved explicitly. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.0069;Anharmonic oscillation effect on the Davydov-Scott monomer in thermal  bath; A. Sulaiman,  F.P. Zen,  H. Alatas,  L.T. Handoko;  The dynamics of Davydov-Scott monomer in a thermal bath with higher order amide-site's displacement leads to anharmonic oscillation effect is investigated using full-quantum approach and the Lindblad formulation of master equation. The specific heat is calculated based on the thermodynamic partition function using the path integral method. The temperature dependence of the specific heat is studied. In the model the specific heat anomaly as pointed out in recent works by Ingold et.al is also observed. However it is found that the anomaly occurs at high temperature region, and the anharmonic oscillation restores the positivity of specific heat. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.0166;Jammed state characterization of the random sequential adsorption of  segments of two lengths on a line; N. A. M. Araujo,  A. Cadilhe;  We characterize the jammed state structure of the random sequential adsorption of segments of two different sizes on a line. To this end, we define the size ratio as a dimensionless quantity measuring the length of the large segments in terms of the smaller ones. We introduce a truncated exponential as an {\it ansatz} for the probability distribution function of the interparticle distance at the jammed state and use it to reckon the first four cumulants of the probability distribution function. The sole free parameter present in the various analytical expressions is tied to the mean interparticle distance from Monte Carlo simulations, while the remaining three cumulants are computed without any free parameter and compared to Monte Carlo results. We find that the proposed {\it ansatz} provides results in good qualitative agreement with Monte Carlo ones. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.0191;The isotropic-to-nematic transition in confined liquid crystals : an  essentially non-universal phenomenon; J.M. Fish,  R.L.C. Vink;  Computer simulations are presented of the isotropic-to-nematic transition in a liquid crystal confined between two parallel plates a distance H apart. The plates are neutral and do not impose any anchoring on the particles. Depending on the shape of the pair potential acting between the particles, we find that the transition either changes from first-order to continuous at a critical film thickness H=Hx, or that the transition remains first-order irrespective of H. This demonstrates that the isotropic-to-nematic transition in confined geometry is not characterized by any universality class, but rather that its fate is determined by microscopic details. The resulting capillary phase diagrams can thus assume two topologies: one where the isotropic and nematic branches of the binodal meet at H=Hx, and one where they remain separated. For values of H where the transition is strongly first-order the shift DT of the transition temperature is in excellent agreement with the Kelvin equation. Not only is the relation DT~1/H recovered but also the prefactor of the shift is in quantitative agreement with the independently measured bulk latent heat and interfacial tension. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.0250;A phase-field-crystal approach to critical nuclei; Rainer Backofen,  Axel Voigt;  We investigate a phase-field-crystal model for homogeneous nucleation. Instead of solving the time evolution of a density field towards equilibrium we use a String Method to identify saddle points in phase space. The saddle points allow to obtain the nucleation barrier and the critical nucleus. The advantage of using the phase-field-crystal model for this task is its ability to resolve atomistic effects. The obtained results indicate different properties of the critical nucleus compared with bulk crystals and show a detailed description of the nucleation process. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.0273;Asymmetric Exclusion Process in a System of Interacting Brownian  Particles; Jose Eduardo de Oliveira Rodrigues,  Ronald Dickman;"  We study a continuous-space version of the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP), consisting of interacting Brownian particles subject to a driving force in a periodic external potential. Particles are inserted at the leftmost site at rate $\alpha$, hop to the right at unit rate, and are removed at the rightmost site at rate $\beta$. Our study is motivated by recent experiments on colloidal particles in optical tweezer arrays. The external potential is of the form generated by such an array. Particles spend most of the time near potential minima, approximating the situation in the lattice gas; a short-range repulsive interaction prevents two particles from occupying the same potential well. A constant driving force, representing Stokes drag on particles suspended in a moving fluid, leads to biased motion. Our results for the density profile and current, obtained via numerical integration of the Langevin equation and dynamic Monte Carlo simulations, indicate that the continuous-space model exhibits phase transitions analogous to those observed in the lattice model. The correspondence is not exact, however, due to the lack of particle-hole symmetry in our model. ";"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.0392;A novel and precise time domain description of MOSFET low frequency  noise due to random telegraph signals; Roberto da Silva,  Gilson Wirth,  Lucas Brusamarello;  Nowadays, random telegraph signals play an important role in integrated circuit performance variability, leading for instance to failures in memory circuits. This problem is related to the successive captures and emissions of electrons at the many traps stochastically distributed at the silicon-oxide (Si-SiO2) interface of MOS transistors. In this paper we propose a novel analytical and numerical approach to statistically describe the fluctuations of current due to random telegraph signal in time domain. Our results include two distinct situations: when the density of interface trap density is uniform in energy, and when it is an u-shape curve as prescribed in literature, here described as simple quadratic function. We establish formulas for relative error as function of the parameters related to capture and emission probabilities. For a complete analysis experimental u-shape curves are used and compared with the theoretical aproach. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

Consequently the critical exponent $\nu$ for three-dimensional self-avoiding walks is determined to great accuracy; the final estimate is $\nu=0.587597(7)$. The method can be adapted to other models of polymers with short-range interactions, on the lattice or in the continuum.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.0542;Volume fluctuations and compressibility of a vibrated granular gas; J. Javier Brey,  M.J. Ruiz-Montero;  The volume fluctuations in the steady state reached by a vibrated granular gas of hard particles confined by a movable piston on the top are investigated by means of event driven simulations. Also, a compressibility factor, measuring the response in volume of the system to a change in the mass of the piston, is introduced and measured. From the second moment of the volume fluctuations and the compressibility factor, an effective temperature is defined, by using the same relation as obeyed by equilibrium molecular systems. The interpretation of this effective temperature and its relationship with the granular temperature of the gas, and also with the velocity fluctuations of the movable piston, is discussed. It is found that the ratio of the temperature based on the volume fluctuations to the temperature based on the piston kinetic energy, obeys simple dependencies on the inelasticity and on the piston-particle mass ratio. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.0604;Densest local sphere-packing diversity: General concepts and application  to two dimensions; A. B. Hopkins,  F. H. Stillinger,  S. Torquato;  The densest local packings of N identical nonoverlapping spheres within a radius Rmin(N) of a fixed central sphere of the same size are obtained using a nonlinear programming method operating in conjunction with a stochastic search of configuration space. Knowledge of Rmin(N) in d-dimensional Euclidean space allows for the construction both of a realizability condition for pair correlation functions of sphere packings and an upper bound on the maximal density of infinite sphere packings. In this paper, we focus on the two-dimensional circular disk problem. We find and present the putative densest packings and corresponding Rmin(N) for selected values of N up to N = 348 and use this knowledge to construct such a realizability condition and upper bound. We additionally analyze the properties and characteristics of the maximally dense packings, finding significant variability in their symmetries and contact networks, and that the vast majority differ substantially from the triangular lattice even for large N. Our work has implications for packaging problems, nucleation theory, and surface physics. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft); Metric Geometry (math.MG)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.0618;Behavior of pressure and viscosity at high densities for two-dimensional  hard and soft granular materials; Michio Otsuki,  Hisao Hayakawa,  Stefan Luding;  The pressure and the viscosity in two-dimensional sheared granular assemblies are investigated numerically. The behavior of both pressure and viscosity is smoothly changing qualitatively when starting from a mono-disperse hard-disk system without dissipation and moving towards a system of (i) poly-disperse, (ii) soft particles with (iii) considerable dissipation. In the rigid, elastic limit of mono-disperse systems, the viscosity is approximately inverse proportional to the area fraction difference from $\phi_{\eta} \simeq 0.7$, but the pressure is still finite at $\phi_{\eta}$. In moderately soft, dissipative and poly-disperse systems, on the other hand, we confirm the recent theoretical prediction that both scaled pressure (divided by the kinetic temperature $T$) and scaled viscosity (divided by $\sqrt{T}$) diverge at the same density, i.e., the jamming transition point $\phi_J > \phi_\eta$, with the exponents -2 and -3, respectively. Furthermore, we observe that the critical region of the jamming transition becomes invisible as the restitution coefficient approaches unity, i.e. for vanishing dissipation. In order to understand the conflict between these two different predictions on the divergence of the pressure and the viscosity, the transition from soft to hard particles is studied in detail and the dimensionless control parameters are defined as ratios of various time-scales. We introduce a dimensionless number, i.e. the ratio of dissipation rate and shear rate, that can identify the crossover from the scaling of very hard, i.e. rigid disks to the scaling in the soft, jamming regime. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.0657;Bulgac-Kusnezov-NosÃ©-Hoover thermostats; Alessandro Sergi,  Gregory S. Ezra;  In this paper we formulate Bulgac-Kusnezov constant temperature dynamics in phase space by means of non-Hamiltonian brackets. Two generalized versions of the dynamics are similarly defined: one where the Bulgac-Kusnezov demons are globally controlled by means of a single additional Nos\'e variable, and another where each demon is coupled to an independent Nos\'e-Hoover thermostat. Numerically stable and efficient measure-preserving time-reversible algorithms are derived in a systematic way for each case. The chaotic properties of the different phase space flows are numerically illustrated through the paradigmatic example of the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator. It is found that, while the simple Bulgac-Kusnezov thermostat is apparently not ergodic, both of the Nos\'e-Hoover controlled dynamics sample the canonical distribution correctly. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)"

Expressed in terms of d it yielded a presumed asymptotic expansion for lambda_d in inverse powers of d. We also considered an expansion in powers of x, a formal variable ultimately set equal to 1. We believe this series has better asymptotic properties than the expansion in inverse powers of d. We discuss this, and apply the same method to the two-dimensional triangular and hexagonal lattices. Viewed as a test of the x-expansion the results on those two lattices are satisfactory, if not thoroughly convincing. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

The situation considered consists of two bodies emitting photons at two different temperatures. We show that the system evolves to a stationary state characterized by an energy current which satisfies a Stefan-Boltzmann-like law expressing it as the difference of the temperatures to the fourth power of the emitters . The results obtained show how the classical laws governing the thermal radiation at equlibrium can be generalized away from equilibrium situations. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

Francis Song,  Stephan Rachel,  Karyn Le Hur;  In one dimension very general results from conformal field theory and exact calculations for certain quantum spin systems have established universal scaling properties of the entanglement entropy between two parts of a critical system. Using both analytical and numerical methods, we show that if particle number or spin is conserved, fluctuations in a subsystem obey identical scaling as a function of subsystem size, suggesting that fluctuations are a useful quantity for determining the scaling of entanglement, especially in higher dimensions. We investigate the effects of boundaries and subleading corrections for critical spin and bosonic chains. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

Here, an optimized form is presented. After generalizing a replica gas identity with an arbitrary weighting function, we obtain a functional form that has the minimal asymptotic variance for samples from two replicas and is provably good for a larger number. This equation is demonstrated to improve the convergence of partition function estimates in a 2D Ising model. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

In the special case of conservative Hamiltonian dynamics, these identities allow us to retrieve quantum versions of Jarzynski and Crooks relations. In the linear response regime, these fluctuation relations yield a fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) valid for a stationary state arbitrarily far from equilibrium. For a closed system, this FDT reduces to the celebrated Callen-Welton-Kubo formula. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.0993;1/f^beta noise in a model for weak ergodicity breaking; Markus Niemann,  Ivan G. Szendro,  Holger Kantz;  In systems with weak ergodicity breaking, the equivalence of time averages and ensemble averages is known to be broken. We study here the computation of the power spectrum from realizations of a specific process exhibiting 1/f^beta noise, the Rebenshtok-Barkai model. We show that even the binned power spectrum does not converge in the limit of infinite time, but that instead the resulting value is a random variable stemming from a distribution with finite variance. However, due to the strong correlations in neighboring frequency bins of the spectrum, the exponent beta can be safely estimated by time averages of this type. Analytical calculations are illustrated by numerical simulations. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.0995;Granular gases under extreme driving; W. Kang,  J. Machta,  E. Ben-Naim;  We study inelastic gases in two dimensions using event-driven molecular dynamics simulations. Our focus is the nature of the stationary state attained by rare injection of large amounts of energy to balance the dissipation due to collisions. We find that under such extreme driving, with the injection rate much smaller than the collision rate, the velocity distribution has a power-law high energy tail. The numerically measured exponent characterizing this tail is in excellent agreement with predictions of kinetic theory over a wide range of system parameters. We conclude that driving by rare but powerful energy injection leads to a well-mixed gas and constitutes an alternative mechanism for agitating granular matter. In this distinct nonequilibrium steady-state, energy cascades from large to small scales. Our simulations also show that when the injection rate is comparable with the collision rate, the velocity distribution has a stretched exponential tail. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.1230;Nonequilibrium thermodynamics at the microscale: Work relations and the  second law; Eliran Boksenbojm,  Bram Wynants,  Christopher Jarzynski;  For macroscopic systems, the second law of thermodynamics establishes an inequality between the amount of work performed on a system in contact with a thermal reservoir, and the change in its free energy. For microscopic systems, this result must be considered statistically, as fluctuations around average behavior become substantial. In recent years it has become recognized that these fluctuations satisfy a number of strong and unexpected relations, which remain valid even when the system is driven far from equilibrium. We discuss these relations, and consider what they reveal about the second law of thermodynamics and the nature of irreversibility at the microscale. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.1388;A New Approach based on Langevin type Equation for Driven Granular Gas  under Gravity; Jun'ichi Wakou,  Masaharu Isobe;  We propose a novel approach based on a Langevin equation for fluctuating motion of the center of mass of granular media fluidized by energy injection from a bottom plate. In this framework, the analytical solution of the Langevin equation is used to derive analytic expressions for several macroscopic quantities and the power spectrum for the center of mass. In order to test our theory, we performed event-driven molecular dynamics simulations for one- and two-dimensional systems. Energy is injected from a vibrating bottom plate in the one-dimensional case and from a thermal wall at the bottom in the two-dimensional case. We found that the theoretical predictions are in good agreement with the results of those simulations under the assumption that the fluctuation-dissipation relation holds in the case of nearly elastic collisions between particles. However, as the inelasticity of the interparticle collisions increases, the power spectrum for the center of mass obtained by the simulations gradually deviates from the prediction of theoretical curve. Connection between this deviation and violation of the fluctuation-dissipation relation is discussed. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

We pay a special attention to the random stirring protocol and study the time-dependent behavior of the variance of the braiding exponent. We show that this behavior belongs to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class typical for models of nonstationary growth. Using the matrix (Magnus) representation of the braid group generators, we relate the random stirring protocol with the growth of random heap generated by a ballistic deposition. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

The geometrical confinements lead to entropic barriers, the particle has to overcome in order to proceed in transport direction. The transport characteristics exhibit peculiar behaviors which are in contrast to what is observed for the transport in potentials with purely energetic barriers. By adjusting the geometric parameters of the channel one can effectively tune the transport and diffusion properties. A prominent example is the maximized enhancement of diffusion for particular channel parameters. The understanding of the role of channel-shape provides the possibility for a design of stylized channels wherein the quality of the transport can be efficiently optimized. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)"

SarÄ±yer,  Michael Hinczewski,  A. Nihat Berker;  The global phase diagram of the spinless Falicov-Kimball model in d = 3 spatial dimensions is obtained by renormalization-group theory. This global phase diagram exhibits five distinct phases. Four of these phases are charge-ordered (CO) phases, in which the system forms two sublattices with different electron densities. The CO phases occur at and near half filling of the conduction electrons for the entire range of localized electron densities. The phase boundaries are second order, except for the intermediate and large interaction regimes, where a first-order phase boundary occurs in the central region of the phase diagram, resulting in phase coexistence at and near half filling of both localized and conduction electrons. These two-phase or three-phase coexistence regions are between different charge-ordered phases, between charge-ordered and disordered phases, and between dense and dilute disordered phases. The second-order phase boundaries terminate on the first-order phase transitions via critical endpoints and double critical endpoints. The first-order phase boundary is delimited by critical points. The cross-sections of the global phase diagram with respect to the chemical potentials and densities of the localized and conduction electrons, at all representative interactions strengths, hopping strengths, and temperatures, are calculated and exhibit ten distinct topologies. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)"

Although it is essential to know the efficiency of this free energy transduction, it has been a challenge due to the system's microscopic scale. Here, we evaluate the single-molecule energetics of a rotary molecular motor, F1-ATPase, by applying a recently derived nonequilibrium equality together with an electrorotation method. We show that the sum of the heat flow through the probe's rotational degree of freedom and the work against external load is almost equal to the free energy change per a single ATP hydrolysis under various conditions. This implies that F1-ATPase works at an efficiency of nearly 100% in a thermally fluctuating environment. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph)"

Our interest are the fluctuations of the time-integrated particle current at some prescribed spatial location. One expects a crossover from Gaussian to Tracy-Widom distributed fluctuations. The appropriate crossover scale is an asymmetry of order $\epsilon^{-1/2}$, times of order $\epsilon^{-2}$, and a spatial location of order $\epsilon^{-3/2}$. For this parameter window we obtain the limiting distribution function of the integrated current in terms of an integral over the difference of two Fredholm determinants. For large times, on the scale $\epsilon^{-2}$, this distribution function converges to the one of Tracy-Widom. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)"

The corresponding distribution function converges in the long time limit, $t\to\infty$, to the Tracy-Widom distribution. The first order correction is a shift of order $t^{-1/3}$.

The solution provides a determinantal formula for the probability distribution function of the height $h(x,t)$ for all $t>0$. In particular, we show that for large $t$, on the scale $t^{1/3}$, the statistics is given by the Tracy-Widom distribution, known already from the theory of GUE random matrices. Our solution confirms that the KPZ equation describes the interface motion in the regime of weak driving force.

We observe different behavior for the subdiffusive (antipersistent) and superdiffusive (persistent) domains. In particular we find that the escape becomes increasingly faster for decreasing values of H, consistent with previous findings on the first passage behavior.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.2000;Systematic Microcanonical Analyses of Polymer Adsorption Transitions; Monika MÃ¶ddel,  Wolfhard Janke,  Michael Bachmann;  In detailed microcanonical analyses of densities of states obtained by extensive multicanonical Monte Carlo computer simulations, we investigate the caloric properties of conformational transitions adsorbing polymers experience near attractive substrates. For short chains and strong surface attraction, the microcanonical entropy turns out to be a convex function of energy in the transition regime, indicating that surface-entropic effects are relevant. Albeit known to be a continuous transition in the thermodynamic limit of infinitely long chains, the adsorption transition of nongrafted finite-length polymers thus exhibits a clear signature of a first-order-like transition, with coexisting phases of adsorbed and desorbed conformations. Another remarkable consequence of the convexity of the microcanonical entropy is that the transition is accompanied by a decrease of the microcanonical temperature with increasing energy. Since this is a characteristic physical effect it might not be ignored in analyses of cooperative macrostate transitions in finite systems. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)"

The resulting framework appears as a suitable generalization of the methodology associated with the so-called \textit{dynamical ensemble}, which is applied to the extension of two well-known Monte Carlo methods: the Metropolis importance sample and the Swendsen-Wang clusters algorithm. These Monte Carlo algorithms are employed to study the anomalous thermodynamic behavior of the Potts models with many spin states $q$ defined on a $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice with periodic boundary conditions, which successfully reduce the exponential divergence of decorrelation time $\tau$ with the increase of the system size $N$ to a weak power-law divergence $\tau\propto N^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha\approx0.2$ for the particular case of the 2D 10-state Potts model. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.2234;Extending canonical Monte Carlo methods II; L. Velazquez,  S. Curilef;  Previously, we have presented a methodology to extend canonical Monte Carlo methods inspired on a suitable extension of the canonical fluctuation relation $C=\beta^{2}<\delta E^{2}>$ compatible with negative heat capacities $C<0$. Now, we improve this methodology by introducing a better treatment of finite size effects affecting the precision of a direct determination of the microcanonical caloric curve $\beta (E) =\partial S(E) /\partial E$, as well as a better implementation of MC schemes. We shall show that despite the modifications considered, the extended canonical MC methods possibility an impressive overcome of the so-called \textit{super-critical slowing down} observed close to the region of a temperature driven first-order phase transition. In this case, the dependence of the decorrelation time $\tau$ with the system size $N$ is reduced from an exponential growth to a weak power-law behavior $\tau(N)\propto N^{\alpha}$, which is shown in the particular case of the 2D seven-state Potts model where the exponent $\alpha=0.14-0.18$. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.2496;Finite size scaling of the de Almeida-Thouless instability in random  sparse networks; Hisanao Takahashi,  Federico Ricci-Tersenghi,  Yoshiyuki Kabashima;  We study, in random sparse networks, finite size scaling of the spin glass susceptibility $\chi_{\rm SG}$, which is a proper measure of the de Almeida-Thouless (AT) instability of spin glass systems. Using a phenomenological argument regarding the band edge behavior of the Hessian eigenvalue distribution, we discuss how $\chi_{\rm SG}$ is evaluated in infinitely large random sparse networks, which are usually identified with Bethe trees, and how it should be corrected in finite systems. In the high temperature region, data of extensive numerical experiments are generally in good agreement with the theoretical values of $\chi_{\rm SG}$ determined from the Bethe tree. In the absence of external fields, the data also show a scaling relation $\chi_{\rm SG}=N^{1/3}F(N^{1/3}|T-T_c|/T_c)$, which has been conjectured in the literature, where $T_c$ is the critical temperature. In the presence of external fields, on the other hand, the numerical data are not consistent with this scaling relation. A numerical analysis of Hessian eigenvalues implies that strong finite size corrections of the lower band edge of the eigenvalue distribution, which seem relevant only in the presence of the fields, are a major source of inconsistency. This may be related to the known difficulty in using only numerical methods to detect the AT instability. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Disordered Systems and Neural Networks (cond-mat.dis-nn)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.2587;Dynamical correlations near dislocation jamming; Lasse Laurson,  M.-Carmen Miguel,  Mikko J. Alava;  Dislocation assemblies exhibit a jamming or yielding transition at a critical external shear stress value $\sigma=\sigma_c$. Nevertheless the nature of this transition has not been ascertained. Here we study the heterogeneous and collective nature of dislocation dynamics within a crystal plasticity model close to $\sigma_c$, by considering the first-passage properties of the dislocation dynamics. As the transition is approached in the moving phase, the first passage time distribution exhibits scaling, and a related peak {\it dynamical} susceptibility $\chi_4^*$ diverges as $\chi_4^* \sim (\sigma-\sigma_c)^{-\alpha}$, with $\alpha \approx 1.1$. We relate this scaling to an avalanche description of the dynamics. While the static structural correlations are found to be independent of the external stress, we identify a diverging dynamical correlation length $\xi_y$ in the direction perpendicular to the dislocation glide motion. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)"

We investigate the collective motion of Chirikov standard maps interacting with time delay through directed links of Gene Regulatory Network of bacterium Escherichia Coli. Departures from strongly chaotic behavior of the isolated maps are studied in relation to different coupling forms and strengths. At smaller coupling intensities the network induces stable and coherent emergent dynamics. The unstable behavior appearing with increase of coupling strength remains confined within a connected sub-network. For the appropriate coupling, network exhibits statistically robust self-organized dynamics in a weakly chaotic regime. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems (nlin.AO); Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph); Molecular Networks (q-bio.MN)"

Sokolov;  The problem of anomalous diffusion in momentum space is considered for plasma-like systems on the basis of a new collision integral, which is appropriate for consideration of the probability transition function (PTF) with long tails in momentum space. The generalized Fokker-Planck equation for description of diffusion (in momentum space) of particles (ions, grains etc.) in a stochastic system of light particles (electrons, or electrons and ions, respectively) is applied to the evolution of the momentum particle distribution in a plasma. In a plasma the developed approach is also applicable to the diffusion of particles with an arbitrary mass relation, due to the small characteristic momentum transfer. The cases of an exponentially decreasing in momentum space (including the Boltzmann-like) kernel in the PT-function, as well as the more general kernels, which create the anomalous diffusion in velocity space due to the long tail in the PT-function, are considered. Effective friction and diffusion coefficients for plasma-like systems are found. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)"

MC time data of various physical quantities are scaled by the MC time data of the dynamic correlation length, which corresponds to changing the system size in the finite-size scaling method. This scaling method is tested in the three-dimensional ferromagnetic Ising spin model and in the three dimensional $\pm J$ Ising spin-glass model. The transition temperature and the critical exponents, $\eta$ and $\nu$, are obtained by the nonequilibrium relaxation data of the susceptibility and the dynamic correlation length apart from the dynamic exponent. We also comment on the definition of the dynamic correlation length in the nonequilibrium relaxation process. The Ornstein-Zernike formula is not always appropriate. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

Santoro,  Alessandro Silva;  We study the dynamics of the quantum Ising chain following a zero-temperature quench of the transverse field strength. Focusing on the behavior of two-point spin correlation functions, we show that the correlators of the order parameter display an effective asymptotic thermal behavior, i.e., they decay exponentially to zero, with a phase coherence rate and a correlation length dictated by the equilibrium law with an effective temperature set by the energy of the initial state. On the contrary, the two-point correlation functions of the transverse magnetization or the density-of-kinks operator decay as a power-law and do not exhibit thermal behavior. We argue that the different behavior is linked to the locality of the corresponding operator with respect to the quasi-particles of the model: non-local operators, such as the order parameter, behave thermally, while local ones do not. We study which features of the two-point correlators are a consequence of the integrability of the model by analizing their robustness with respect to a sufficiently strong integrability-breaking term. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.2969;Effect of correlated noise on quasi-1D diffusion; D.V. Tkachenko,  V.R. Misko,  F.M. Peeters;  Single-file diffusion (SFD) of an infinite one-dimensional chain of interacting particles has a long-time mean-square displacement (MSD) ~t^1/2, independent of the type of inter-particle repulsive interaction. This behavior is also observed in finite-size chains, although only for certain intervals of time t depending on the chain length L, followed by the ~t for t->infinity, as we demonstrate for a closed circular chain of diffusing interacting particles. Here we show that spatial correlation of noise slows down SFD and can result, depending on the amount of correlated noise, in either subdiffusive behavior ~t^alpha, where 0<alpha<1/2, or even in a total suppression of diffusion (in the limit N-> infinity). Spatial correlation can explain the subdiffusive behavior in recent SFD experiments in circular channels. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.2990;Reconstruction of potential energy profiles from multiple rupture time  distributions; Pak-Wing Fok,  Tom Chou;  We explore the mathematical and numerical aspects of reconstructing a potential energy profile of a molecular bond from its rupture time distribution. While reliable reconstruction of gross attributes, such as the height and the width of an energy barrier, can be easily extracted from a single first passage time (FPT) distribution, the reconstruction of finer structure is ill-conditioned. More careful analysis shows the existence of optimal bond potential amplitudes (represented by an effective Peclet number) and initial bond configurations that yield the most efficient numerical reconstruction of simple potentials. Furthermore, we show that reconstruction of more complex potentials containing multiple minima can be achieved by simultaneously using two or more measured FPT distributions, obtained under different physical conditions. For example, by changing the effective potential energy surface by known amounts, additional measured FPT distributions improve the reconstruction. We demonstrate the possibility of reconstructing potentials with multiple minima, motivate heuristic rules-of-thumb for optimizing the reconstruction, and discuss further applications and extensions. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)"

Particles are fed into the ZRP from an injection site and can also evaporate from anywhere in the interior of the ZRP. Two dynamics are considered; bulk dynamics, where particle hopping and decay is proportional to the numqber of particles at each site, and surface dynamics, where only the top particle at each site can hop or evaporate. We find exact solutions in the bulk dynamics case and for a single-site ZRP obeying surface dynamics. For a multisite ZRP obeying surface dynamics, we compare simulations with approximations obtained from the steady-state limit, where mean interarrival times for both models are equivalent. Our results highlight the competition between injection and evaporation on the arrival times of particles to an absorbing site. ";Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.3103;Infinite Cycles in Boson Lattice Models; G. Boland;  We study the relationship between long cycles and Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in the case of several models. A convenient expression for the density of particles on cycles of length $q$ is obtained, in terms of $q$ unsymmetrised particles coupled with a boson field. Using this formulation we reproduce known results on the Ideal Bose Gas, Mean-Field and Perturbed Mean-Field Models, where the condensate density exactly equals the long cycle density. Then we consider the Infinite-Range-Hopping Bose-Hubbard model, with and without hard-cores. For the hard-core case, we find we can disregard the hopping contribution of the q unsymmetrised particles to obtain an exact expression for the density of particles on long cycles. It is shown that only the cycle of length one contributes to the cycle density. We conclude that while the existence of a non-zero long cycle density coincides with the occurrence of Bose-Einstein condensation, the respective densities are not necessarily equal. For the case of a finite on-site repulsion, we obtain an expression for the cycle density by neglecting the $q$ unsymmetrised hop. Inspired by the Approximating Hamiltonian method we conjecture a simplified expression for the short cycle density as a ratio of single-site partition functions. In the absence of condensation we prove that this simplification is exact and find that in this case the long-cycle density vanishes. In the presence of condensation we justify this simplification when a gauge-symmetry breaking term is introduced in the Hamiltonian.

It is shown that all ensembles under study, including ordinary canonical and grand canonical ensembles, involve surface terms. For a canonical ensemble both surface and volume terms correspond to a closed system. For a grand canonical ensemble the volume term corresponds to an open system, while the surface one - to a closed one. Finally, for the recently introduced open statistical ensemble the specific feature of which is the consideration of some surrounding region both volume and surface terms correspond to an open system. In conclusion, surface particles at solid/fluid boundary are interpreted as particles corresponding to number density oscillations near the surface; this completely agrees with the earlier introduced concept of surface tension at such a boundary.

Contrary to the usual assumption, we show that the reversible (steady state branch) of the density--acceleration curve is nonmonotonous. Accordingly, steady states with the same mean volume can be reached by tapping the system with very different intensities. Simulations of dissipative frictional disks show that equal volume steady states have different values of the force moment tensor. Additionally, we find that steady states of equal stress can be obtained by changing the duration of the taps; however, these states present distinct mean volumes. These results confirm previous speculations that the volume and the force moment tensor are both needed to describe univocally equilibrium states in static granular assemblies.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.3268;Kinetic equations for systems with long-range interactions: a unified  description; Pierre-Henri Chavanis;  We complete the existing literature on the kinetic theory of systems with long-range interactions. Starting from the BBGKY hierarchy, or using projection operator technics or a quasilinear theory, a general kinetic equation can be derived when collective effects are neglected. This equation (which is not well-known) applies to possibly spatially inhomogeneous systems, which is specific to systems with long-range interactions. Interestingly, the structure of this kinetic equation bears a clear physical meaning in terms of generalized Kubo relations. Furthermore, this equation takes a very similar form for stellar systems and two-dimensional point vortices providing therefore a unified description of the kinetic theory of these systems. If we assume that the system is spatially homogeneous (or axisymmetric for point vortices), this equation can be simplified and reduces to the Landau equation (or its counterpart for point vortices). Our formalism thus offers a simple derivation of Landau-type equations. We also use this general formalism to derive a kinetic equation, written in angle-action variables, describing spatially inhomogeneous systems with long-range interactions. This new derivation solves the shortcomings of our previous derivation [P.H. Chavanis, Physica A 377, 469 (2007)]. Finally, we consider a test particle approach and derive general expressions for the diffusion and friction (or drift) coefficients of a test particle evolving in a bath of field particles. We make contact with the expressions previously obtained in the literature. As an application of the kinetic theory, we argue that the relaxation time is shorter for inhomogeneous (or high-dimensional) systems than for homogeneous (or low-dimensional) systems because there are potentially more resonances. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

Munoz;  Why are most empirical networks, with the prominent exception of social ones, generically degree-degree anticorrelated, i.e. disassortative? With a view to answering this long-standing question, we define a general class of degree-degree correlated networks and obtain the associated Shannon entropy as a function of parameters. It turns out that the maximum entropy does not typically correspond to uncorrelated networks, but to either assortative (correlated) or disassortative (anticorrelated) ones. More specifically, for highly heterogeneous (scale-free) networks, the maximum entropy principle usually leads to disassortativity, providing a parsimonious explanation to the question above. Furthermore, by comparing the correlations measured in some real-world networks with those yielding maximum entropy for the same degree sequence, we find a remarkable agreement in various cases. Our approach provides a neutral model from which, in the absence of further knowledge regarding network evolution, one can obtain the expected value of correlations. In cases in which empirical observations deviate from the neutral predictions -- as happens in social networks -- one can then infer that there are specific correlating mechanisms at work. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Disordered Systems and Neural Networks (cond-mat.dis-nn); Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)"

An improved algorithm is presented which builds on the Wolff cluster algorithm in one-dimensional subspaces of the configuration space. This improvement allows us to study classical systems up to $L=512$. Based on the new algorithm we give evidence for the presence of strongly anomalous scaling for periodic boundary conditions which is much worse than anticipated before. We propose and study alternative boundary conditions for the compass model which do not make use of extended configuration spaces and show that they completely remove the problem with finite-size scaling. In the last part, we apply these boundary conditions to the quantum problem and present a considerably improved estimate for the critical temperature which should be of interest for future studies on the compass model. Our investigation identifies a strong one-dimensional magnetic ordering tendency with a large correlation length as the cause of the unusual scaling and moreover allows for a precise quantification of the anomalous length scale involved. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)"

The electronic structure calculations show a decisive role of lattice dynamics in the process of proton migration. In the obtained revised mechanism of proton transport, the strong displacements of the vertex oxygens play a key role in the establishing the continuous hydrogen transport and in the achieving low activation energies of proton conduction which is in contrast to the standard two-stage Grotthuss mechanism of proton transport. Consequently, any realistic model description of proton transport should inevitably involve the interactions with the sublattice of the XO4 groups.

We provide numerical evidence that the partition-function zeros are becoming dense everywhere in the complex q-plane outside the limiting curve B_\infty(sq) for this model with ordinary (e.g. free or cylindrical) boundary conditions. Despite this, the infinite-volume free energy is perfectly analytic in this region. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Combinatorics (math.CO)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.3811;General no-go condition for stochastic pumping; C. Maes,  K. Netocny,  S. R. Thomas;  The control of chemical dynamics requires understanding the effect of time-dependent transition rates between states of chemo-mechanical molecular configurations. Pumping refers to generating a net current, e.g. per period in the time-dependence, through a cycle of consecutive states. The working of artificial machines or synthesized molecular motors depends on it. In this paper we give short and simple proofs of no-go theorems, some of which appeared before but here with essential extensions to non-Markovian dynamics, including the study of the diffusion limit. It allows to exclude certain protocols in the working of chemical motors where only the depth of the energy well is changed in time and not the barrier height between pairs of states. We also show how pre-existing steady state currents are in general modified with a multiplicative factor when this time-dependence is turned on. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

On the plane, beyond patches, patterns periodic in both dimensions, we remark the presence of structures periodic in one dimension, that we call strings. We classify completely their constituents in terms of their principal periodic vector k, that we call momentum. We derive a simple relation between the momentum of a string and its density of particles, E, which is reminiscent of a dispersion relation, E=k^2. Strings interact: they can merge and split and within these processes momentum is conserved. We reveal the role of the modular group SL(2,Z) behind these laws. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat); Combinatorics (math.CO); Cellular Automata and Lattice Gases (nlin.CG)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.4026;A probabilistic mechanics theory for random dynamics; Qiuping A. Wang;  This is a general description of a probabilistic formalism of mechanics, i.e., an extension of the Newtonian mechanics principles to the systems undergoing random motion. From an analysis of the induction procedure from experimental data to the Newtonian laws, it is shown that the experimental verification of Newton law in a random motion implies a stochastic extension of the virtual work principle and the least action principle, i.e., <dW>=0 and <dA>=0 averaged over all the random paths instead of dW=0 and dA=0 for single path in regular dynamics. A probabilistic mechanics is formulated and applied to thermodynamic system. Several known results, rules and principles can be reproduced and justified from this new point of view. To mention some, we have obtain the entropy variation of the free expansion of gas and heat conduction without considering local equilibrium, and a violation of the Liouville theorem and Poincar\'e recurrence theorem, which allows to relate the entropy production to the work performed by random forces in nonequilibrium process. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

The validity range, specific heat and Tsallis entropy obtained by the two average methods are compared. Validity ranges of the $q$- and normal averages are $0 < q < q_U$ and $q > q_L$, respectively, where $q_U=1+(\eta DN)^{-1}$, $q_L=1-(\eta DN+1)^{-1}$ and $\eta=1/2$ ($\eta=1$) for ideal gases (harmonic oscillators). The energy and specific heat in the $q$- and normal averages coincide with those in the Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics, % independently of $q$, although this coincidence does not hold for the fluctuation of energy. The Tsallis entropy for $N |q-1| \gg 1$ obtained by the $q$-average is quite different from that derived by the normal average, despite a fairly good agreement of the two results for $|q-1 | \ll 1$. It has been pointed out that first-principles approaches previously proposed in the superstatistics yield $additive$ $N$-body entropy ($S^{(N)}= N S^{(1)}$) which is in contrast with the $nonadditive$ Tsallis entropy. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

The use of the Aharony-Fisher non-linear scaling variables allowed us to perform calculations sufficiently away from the critical point to obtain very high precision data, which convincingly confirm all predictions of the scaling and universality hypotheses. The results are in excellent agreement with the field theory calculations of Fonseca and Zamolodchikov as well as with many previously known exact and numerical results for the 2D Ising model. This includes excellent agreement with the classic analytic results for the magnetic susceptibility by Barouch, McCoy, Tracy and Wu, recently enhanced by Orrick, Nickel, Guttmann and Perk. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)"

The method is based on a generating function method, and arbitrary moments of the probability distribution of the number of transitions are in principle calculated by solving numerically a system of coupled differential equations. As an example, a two state model with a time-dependent transition matrix is considered and the first, second and third moments of the current are calculated. This calculation scheme is applicable for any stochastic process with a finite state space, and it would be helpful to study current statistics in nonequilibrium systems. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.4353;Unusual Corrections to Scaling in Entanglement Entropy; John Cardy,  Pasquale Calabrese;  We present a general theory of the corrections to the asymptotic behaviour of the Renyi entropies which measure the entanglement of an interval A of length L with the rest of an infinite one-dimensional system, in the case when this is described by a conformal field theory of central charge c. These can be due to bulk irrelevant operators of scaling dimension x>2, in which case the leading corrections are of the expected form L^{-2(x-2)} for values of n close to 1. However for n>x/(x-2) corrections of the form L^{2-x-x/n} and L^{-2x/n} arise and dominate the conventional terms. We also point out that the last type of corrections can also occur with x less than 2. They arise from relevant operators induced by the conical space-time singularities necessary to describe the reduced density matrix. These agree with recent analytic and numerical results for quantum spin chains. We also compute the effect of marginally irrelevant bulk operators, which give a correction (log L)^{-2}, with a universal amplitude. We present analogous results for the case when the interval lies at the end of a semi-infinite system. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

We map the model to a fermionic system and identify the topological sectors associated with different Z_2 patterns in terms of fermion occupation numbers. Within these different sectors, we investigate the effect of a linear quench across a quantum critical point. We study the dominant behavior of the system by employing a Landau-Zener-type analysis of the effective Hamiltonian in the low-energy subspace for which the effective quenching can sometimes be non-linear. We show that the quenching leads to a residual energy which scales as a power of the quenching rate, and that the power depends on the topological sectors and their symmetry properties in a non-trivial way. This behavior is consistent with the general theory of quantum quenching, but with the correlation length exponent \nu being different in different sectors. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)"

We compare the results at both zero and finite temperatures. At asymptotically large separations we obtain analytical results for the interaction that reveal a non-universal, i.e., material dependent interaction for the plasma model. The latter result contains the asymptotic interaction for Drude metals and perfect reflectors as different but universal limiting cases. This observation is related to the screening of a static magnetic field by a London superconductor. For small separations we find corrections to the proximity force approximation (PFA) that support correlations between geometry and material properties that are not captured by the Lifshitz theory. Our results at finite temperatures reveal for Drude metals a non-monotonic temperature dependence of the Casimir free energy and a negative entropy over a sizeable range of separations. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

Concretely, we compare the equilibrium spin correlation function in a frustrated lattice which exhibits a non-monotonic temperature dependence (reentrant type dependence) with that in the ground state as a function of the transverse field that causes the quantum fluctuation. We find the correlation function in the ground state also shows a non-monotonic dependence on the strength of the transverse field. We also study the real-time dynamics of the spin correlation function under a time-dependent field. After sudden decrease of the temperature, we found non-monotonic changes of the correlation function reflecting the static temperature dependence, which indicates that an effective temperature of the system changes gradually. For the quantum system, we study the dependence of changes of the correlation function on the sweeping speed of the transverse field. Contrary to the classical case, the correlation function varies little in a rapid change of the field, though it shows a non-monotonic change when we sweep the field slowly. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Disordered Systems and Neural Networks (cond-mat.dis-nn); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

This amplification ratio of the relaxation time is represented by a scaling function as $h = N \exp(-\beta V)$, and it becomes prominent as $N$ becomes less than a critical value $h \sim 1$, where $\beta$ is the inverse temperature and $V$ is the energy gap between a product and a resource. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

It is shown that, in this case, these distributions are in the shape of q-Gaussians, which are the standard distributions obtained in nonextensive statistical mechanics. Moreover, an exact relation connecting the exponent $\tau$ of avalanche size distribution and the q value of appropriate q-Gaussian has been obtained as q=(tau+2)/tau. Making use of this relation one can easily determine the q parameter values of the appropriate q-Gaussians a priori from one of the well-known exponents of the system. Since the coherent noise model has the advantage of producing different tau values by varying a model parameter \sigma, clear numerical evidences on the validity of the proposed relation have been achieved for different cases.

The diagonalization of the corresponding Hamiltonian leads to a renormalization of the phonon frequencies in terms of the phonon friction or damping coefficient. Moreover, when there are adsorbates on the surface, this single-bath model can be extended to a two-bath model accounting for the effect induced by the adsorbates on the phonon lineshapes as well as their corresponding lineshapes. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

Spectral decomposition then brings about an eigenvalue problem for a non-Hermitian linear differential operator. The ground-state eigenmode encodes the stationary distribution of the population size. For long-lived metastable populations which exhibit extinction or escape to another metastable state, the quasi-stationary distribution and the mean time to extinction or escape are encoded by the eigenmode and eigenvalue of the lowest excited state. If the average population size in the stationary or quasi-stationary state is large, the corresponding eigenvalue problem can be solved via WKB approximation amended by other asymptotic methods. We illustrate these ideas in several model examples. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)"

In designing such graphs, an important question is how the probability of graphs with large spectral gap behaves. A method based on multicanonical Monte Carlo is introduced to quantify the behavior of this probability, which enables us to calculate extreme tails of the distribution. The proposed method is successfully applied to random 3-regular graphs and large deviation probability is estimated. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Disordered Systems and Neural Networks (cond-mat.dis-nn); Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)"

According to the spirit of the original Bochkov-Kuzovlev approach, we adopt the ""exclusive"" viewpoint, meaning that the coupling to the external work-source is {\it not} counted as part of the internal energy. The corresponding canonical and microcanonical quantum fluctuation theorems are derived as well, and are compared to the respective theorems obtained within the ""inclusive"" approach. The relations between the quantum inclusive-work $w$, the exclusive-work $w_0$ and the dissipated-work $w_{dis}$, are discussed and clarified. We show by an explicit example that $w_0$ and $w_{dis}$ are distinct stochastic quantities obeying different statistics. ";Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

In a second part of the paper we apply the formalism to the study to non-disordered ferromagnets, in equilibrium or in the coarsening kinetics following a critical or sub-critical quench. We show numerically that the variances and the non-linear susceptibility obey scaling with respect to the coherence length $\xi$ in equilibrium, and with respect to the growing length $L(t)$ after a quench, similarly to what is known for the autocorrelation and the autoresponse functions. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

On a strip geometry, the competition between the ""trap size"" $\ell$ and the strip width, $L$, is analysed in the context of a generalized finite-size scaling {\em ansatz}. In the low-field regime $\ell \gg L$, we use conformal-invariance concepts in conjunction with a linear-response approach to derive the appropriate ($p$-dependent) limit of the theory, which agrees very well with numerical results for magnetization profiles. For high fields $\ell \lesssim L$, correlation-length scaling data broadly confirms an existing picture of $p$-dependent characteristic exponents.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1003.1089;Towards a modeling of the time dependence of contact area between solid  bodies; E. A. Jagla;  I present a simple model of the time dependence of the contact area between solid bodies, assuming either a totally uncorrelated surface topography, or a self affine surface roughness. The existence of relaxation effects (that I incorporate using a recently proposed model) produces the time increase of the contact area $A(t)$ towards an asymptotic value that can be much smaller than the nominal contact area. For an uncorrelated surface topography, the time evolution of $A(t)$ is numerically found to be well fitted by expressions of the form [$A(\infty)-A(t)]\sim (t+t_0)^{-q}$, where the exponent $q$ depends on the normal load $F_N$ as $q\sim F_N^{\beta}$, with $\beta$ close to 0.5. In particular, when the contact area is much lower than the nominal area I obtain $A(t)/A(0) \sim 1+C\ln(t/t_0+1)$, i.e., a logarithmic time increase of the contact area, in accordance with experimental observations. The logarithmic increase for low loads is also obtained analytically in this case. For the more realistic case of self affine surfaces, the results are qualitatively similar. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)"

A periodically forced subdiffusion in a parity-broken ratchet potential is considered within the non-Markovian generalized Langevin equation (GLE) description with a power-law memory kernel $\eta(t)\propto t^{-\alpha}$ ($0<\alpha<1$). It is shown that subdiffusive rectification currents, defined through the mean displacement and subvelocity $v_{\alpha}$, $<\delta x(t)>\sim v_{\alpha} t^{\alpha}/ \Gamma(1+\alpha)$, emerge asymptotically due to the breaking of the detailed balance symmetry by driving. The asymptotic exponent is $\alpha$, the same as for free subdiffusion, $<\delta x^2(t)>\propto t^\alpha$. However, a transient to this regime with some time-dependent $\alpha_{\rm eff}(t)$ gradually decaying in time, $\alpha\leq \alpha_{\rm eff}(t)\leq 1$, can be very slow depending on the barrier height and the driving field strength. In striking contrast to its normal diffusion counterpart, the anomalous rectification current is absent asymptotically in the limit of adiabatic driving with frequency $\Omega\to 0$, displaying a resonance like dependence on the driving frequency. However, an anomalous current inversion occurs for a sufficiently fast driving, like in the normal diffusion case. In the lowest order of the driving field, such a rectification current presents a quadratic response effect. Beyond perturbation regime it exhibits a broad maximum versus the driving field strength. Moreover, anomalous current exhibits a maximum versus the potential amplitude. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

The mechanism becomes effective in the case of conformation transitions between quasi-isoenergetic molecular states. It is shown that at room temperatures, stochastic broadening of molecular energy levels predominates the energy of low frequency vibrations accompanying the transition. This leads to a cancellation of temperature dependence in the stochastically averaged rate constants. As an example, physical interpretation of temperature-independent onset of P2X_3 receptor desensitization in neuronal membranes is provided. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

Treating the creation rate of active sites between inactive domains as an independent parameter leads to a rich phase diagram. In addition to the conventional active and inactive phases we find a parameter region where the simple contact process is inactive, but an infinitesimal creation rate at the boundary between inactive domains is sufficient to take the system into the active phase. Thus, the generalized contact process has two different phase transition lines. The point separating them shares some characteristics with a multicritical point. We also study in detail the critical behaviors of these transitions and their universality. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

We show that the transition from mean-field statistics to fluctuation-dominated statistics which, for the more commonly considered case of diffusive transport, occurs as the spatial dimension of the system is tuned through two from above, can be mimicked even in one dimension by varying the characteristic exponent, beta, of the the Levy jump length distribution. We also show that the two-point mass correlation function, responsible for the flux of mass in the stationary state, is strongly universal: its scaling exponent is given by the mean field value independent of the spatial dimension and independent of the value of beta. Finally we study numerically the two point spatial correlation function which characterises the structure of the depletion zone around heavy particles in the diffusion limited regime. We find that this correlation function vanishes with a non-trivial fractional power of the separation between particles as this separation goes to zero. We provide a scaling argument for the value of this exponent which is in reasonable agreement with the numerical measurements. ;"Classical Physics (physics.class-ph); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)"

Kuzemsky;  The development and applications of the method of quasiaverages developed by N. N. Bogoliubov to quantum statistical physics and to quantum solid state theory and, in particular, to quantum theory of magnetism, were analyzed. The problem of finding the ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic and superconducting symmetry broken solutions of the correlated lattice fermion models was discussed within the irreducible Green functions method. A unified scheme for the construction of generalized mean fields (elastic scattering corrections) and self-energy (inelastic scattering) in terms of the Dyson equation was generalized in order to include the source fields. The interrelation of the Bogoliubov's idea of quasiaverages and the concepts of symmetry breaking and quantum protectorate was discussed briefly in the context of quantum statistical physics. The idea of quantum protectorate reveals the essential difference in the behaviour of the complex many-body systems at the low-energy and high-energy scales. It was shown that the role of symmetry (and the breaking of symmetries) in combination with the degeneracy of the system was reanalyzed and essentially clarified within the framework of the method of quasiaverages. The complementary notion of quantum protectorate might provide distinctive signatures and good criteria for a hierarchy of energy scales and the appropriate emergent behavior. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)"

Sarlis,  P.A. Varotsos;  Electric field variations that appear before rupture have been recently studied by employing the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) as a scaling method to quantify long-range temporal correlations. These studies revealed that seismic electric signals (SES) activities exhibit a scale invariant feature with an exponent $\alpha_{DFA} \approx 1$ over all scales investigated (around five orders of magnitude). Here, we study what happens upon significant data loss, which is a question of primary practical importance, and show that the DFA applied to the natural time representation of the remaining data still reveals for SES activities an exponent close to 1.0, which markedly exceeds the exponent found in artificial (man-made) noises. This, in combination with natural time analysis, enables the identification of a SES activity with probability 75% even after a significant (70%) data loss. The probability increases to 90% or larger for 50% data loss. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability (physics.data-an)"

By employing full exact diagonalization, we study chaos indicators and few-body observables. We show that with increasing system size, chaotic behavior is seen over a broader range of parameters and, in particular, deeper into the insulating phase. Concomitantly, we observe that, as the system size increases, the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis extends its range of validity inside the insulating phase and is accompanied by the thermalization of the system. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)"

The time-dependent generalized Fokker-Planck equation that corresponds to the first-order Langevin equation driven by such a noise is derived and solved exactly. This noise generates two probabilistic states of the system, survived and absorbed, that are equivalent to those for a classical particle in an absorbing medium. The connection between the rate of absorption and the super-heavy-tailed distribution of the increments is established analytically. A numerical scheme for the simulation of the Langevin equation with super-heavy-tailed noise is developed and used to verify our theoretical results. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1003.1412;Network conduciveness with application to the graph-coloring and  independent-set optimization transitions; Valmir C. Barbosa;  We introduce the notion of a network's conduciveness, a probabilistically interpretable measure of how the network's structure allows it to be conducive to roaming agents, in certain conditions, from one portion of the network to another. We exemplify its use through an application to the two problems in combinatorial optimization that, given an undirected graph, ask that its so-called chromatic and independence numbers be found. Though NP-hard, when solved on sequences of expanding random graphs there appear marked transitions at which optimal solutions can be obtained substantially more easily than right before them. We demonstrate that these phenomena can be understood by resorting to the network that represents the solution space of the problems for each graph and examining its conduciveness between the non-optimal solutions and the optimal ones. At the said transitions, this network becomes strikingly more conducive in the direction of the optimal solutions than it was just before them, while at the same time becoming less conducive in the opposite direction. We believe that, besides becoming useful also in other areas in which network theory has a role to play, network conduciveness may become instrumental in helping clarify further issues related to NP-hardness that remain poorly understood. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)"

We work within the specific model of a hermitian, scalar field with polynomial self-interaction in two-dimensional Minkowski space. Our main results are as follows: Firstly, that one can obtain a non-perturbative, exact integro-differential equation for the number densities, which we called the pre-Boltzmann equation. We secondly take the long-time-dilute-medium limit of this equation, to obtain a simpler equation. This limiting equation is qualitatively similar to the Boltzmann equation, but it involves additional re-scattering terms. These terms disappear if perform a perturbation expansion in the coupling constant and ignore the loop corrections (Born approximation). If loop corrections are included, then we argue that for consistency, one must also keep corresponding rescattering terms which are normally ignored. Our analysis is hence of potential relevance for physical applications of the Boltzmann equation wherein loop effects are essential, such as in the standard scenario of baryogensis in the Early Universe. Our analysis is performed in the context of flat spacetime, but in such a way that the main ingredients can be transferred, straightforwardly to the case of a curved spacetime of Robertson-Walker-type. Our main technical tools are methods from constructive quantum field theory, as well as a general method called ""projection technique"". This turns out to give convergent expansions, and a rather elegant way of organizing the combinatorics of the various quantum field theoretic expansions in the analysis.

Interestingly, these structural and dynamic features often emerge simultaneously in driven dissipative systems. Here we seek an origin of their co-existence by numerical simulations of a two-dimensional driven granular gas. We reveal a causal link between superdiffusive transport and giant density fluctuations. The kinetic dissipation upon particle collisions depends on the relative velocity of colliding particles, and is responsible for the self-generated large-scale persistent directional motion of particles that underlies the link between structure and transport. This scenario is supported by a simple scaling argument. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

Of principal interest is the dependence of the critical creation rate, lambda_c, on the diffusion probability D, in particular, whether survival is possible at arbitrarily small creation rates, for sufficiently rapid diffusion. Whilst the PA predicts that in any spatial dimension d \geq 1, lambda_c -> 0 at some diffusion probability D* < 1, Katori and Konno [Physica A {\bf 186}, 578 (1992)] showed rigorously that for d \leq 2, one has lambda_c > 0 for any D<1. Our simulation results are consistent with this theorem. In two dimensions, the extinction region becomes narrow as D approaches unity, following lambda_c \propto \exp[- \rm{const.}/(1-D)^\gamma], with gamma = 1.41(2).

Troyan;  Correlation effects arising during liquid infiltration into hydrophobic porous medium are considered. On the basis of these effects a mechanism of energy absorption at filling porous medium by nonwetting liquid is suggested. In accordance with this mechanism, the absorption of mechanical energy is a result expenditure of energy for the formation of menisci in the pores on the shell of the infinite cluster and expenditure of energy for the formation of liquid-porous medium interface in the pores belonging to the infinite cluster of filled pores. It was found that in dependences on the porosity and, consequently, in dependences on the number of filled pores neighbors, the thermal effect of filling can be either positive or negative and the cycle of infiltration-defiltration can be closed with full outflow of liquid. It can occur under certain relation between percolation properties of porous medium and the energy characteristics of the liquid-porous medium interface and the liquid-gas interface. It is shown that a consecutive account of these correlation effects and percolation properties of the pores space during infiltration allow to describe all experimental data under discussion. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)"

Moreover, we discuss the relation between the effective model presented here and another model introduced by Thirring forty years ago. The two models are very similar and can be considered as examples of a class of minimal models of self-gravitating systems. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)"

Particles likewise confined in a narrow channel show a generic upstream flux in Poiseuille flow: chiral swimming is not required. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft); Other Quantitative Biology (q-bio.OT)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1003.2034;Crumpling transition of the triangular lattice without open edges:  effect of a modified folding rule; Yoshihiro Nishiyama (Okayama University);"  Folding of the triangular lattice in a discrete three-dimensional space is investigated by means of the transfer-matrix method. This model was introduced by Bowick and co-workers as a discretized version of the polymerized membrane in thermal equilibrium. The folding rule (constraint) is incompatible with the periodic-boundary condition, and the simulation has been made under the open-boundary condition. In this paper, we propose a modified constraint, which is compatible with the periodic-boundary condition; technically, the restoration of translational invariance leads to a substantial reduction of the transfer-matrix size. Treating the cluster sizes L \le 7, we analyze the singularities of the crumpling transitions for a wide range of the bending rigidity K. We observe a series of the crumpling transitions at K=0.206(2), -0.32(1), and -0.76(10). At each transition point, we estimate the latent heat as Q=0.356(30), 0.08(3), and 0.05(5), respectively.

The algorithm consists of evolving the system with a modified dynamics for which the required event occurs more frequently. By keeping track of the relative weight of phase-space trajectories generated by the modified and the original dynamics one can obtain the required probabilities. The algorithm is tested on two model systems of steady-state particle and heat transport where we find a huge improvement from direct simulation methods. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

Each node in the network of states starts with equal occupation probability and this probability distribution then evolves to a steady state. Nodes left with finite occupation probability determine the attractors and the sizes of their basins. As for synchronous update, the basin entropy grows with system size only for critical networks, where the distribution of attractor lengths is a power law. We determine analytically the distribution for the number of attractors and basin sizes for frozen networks with connectivity K = 1. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph); Other Quantitative Biology (q-bio.OT)"

By analyzing the scaling relations for the random-walk probability and for the resistivity in the equivalent electric problem, we obtain the asymptotic behavior of the mean square displacement as a function of the exponent characterizing the scatterers distribution. We demonstrate that in quenched media different average procedures can display different asymptotic behavior. In particular, we estimate the moments of the displacement averaged over processes starting from scattering sites, in analogy with recent experiments.

A Monte Carlo approach is used to simulate electron transport, including the evolution of spin polarization and relaxation, by taking into account intravalley and intervalley scattering phenomena of the hot electrons in the medium. Spin relaxation lengths and times are computed through the D'yakonov-Perel process, which is the more relevant spin relaxation mechanism in the regime of interest (10 < T < 300 K). The decay of the initial spin polarization of the conduction electrons is calculated as a function of the distance in the presence of a static electric field varying in the range 0.1 - 2 kV/cm. We find that the electron spin depolarization lengths and times have a nonmonotonic dependence on both the lattice temperature and the electric field amplitude. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)"

The possible role of the Ginzburg regime in determining the vortex line density for the case of a quench in 4He is raised and tentatively dismissed. The difference in the anticipated origin of the dominant signal in the two (3He and 4He) cases is pointed out and the resulting consequences for the subsequent decay of vorticity are noted. The possibility of a significant discrepancy between the effective field theory and (quantum) kinetic theory descriptions of the order parameter is briefly touched upon, using atomic Bose-Einstein condensates as an example.

Application to a  scale-invariant probabilistic model; Antonio Rodriguez,  Constantino Tsallis;"  As well known, cumulant expansion is an alternative way to moment expansion to fully characterize probability distributions provided all the moments exist. If this is not the case, the so called escort mean values (or q-moments) have been proposed to characterize probability densities with divergent moments [C. Tsallis et al, J. Math.

We derive, within the constraints of the mapping to classical diffusio-phoresis, an analytical expression for the phoretic velocity of such an object. This allows us to analyze in detail the dependence of the velocity on the aspect ratio of the polar and the equatorial diameters of the particle and on the fraction of the particle surface contributing to the chemical reaction. The particular cases of a sphere and of an approximation for a needle-like particle, which are the most common shapes employed in experimental realizations of such self-propelled objects, are obtained from the general solution in the limits that the aspect ratio approaches one or becomes very large, respectively. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)"

Absence of a heat bath in optical lattice experiments suggests a study of this model within the microcanonical ensemble. The microcanonical entropy is calculated analytically, and nonequivalence of microcanonical and canonical ensembles is found for a range of anisotropy parameters. From the shape of the entropy it follows that the Curie-Weiss Heisenberg model is indistinguishable from the Curie-Weiss Ising model in canonical thermodynamics, although their microcanonical thermodynamics differs. Qualitatively, the observed features of nonequivalent ensembles are expected to be relevant for long-range quantum spin systems realized in optical lattice experiments. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

The condition is expressed by an explicit disequality that has to be satisfied by the stationary state, and it generalizes the known disequality for homogeneous stationary states. In addition, we derive analogous disequalities that express necessary and sufficient conditions of formal stability for the stationary states. Their usefulness, from the point of view of linear dynamical stability, is that they are simpler, although they provide only sufficient criteria of linear stability. We show that for homogeneous stationary states the relations become equal, and therefore linear dynamical stability and formal stability become equivalent. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

The approach is based on the low-temperature approximation of the 2D XY model known as the Villain model and does not involve any additional approximations, thus preserving the lattice structure. The exact form of the Hamiltonian describing a system of topological charges and a vacant site supports the attractive type of interaction between the vacancy and the charges. The quantitative difference between the characteristics of the vortex behavior in the 2D XY and Villain models due to the different energy of the vortex ""cores"" in the two models is pointed out. This leads to a conclusion that the interaction between a vortex and a spin vacancy and between a vortex and the antivortex differs quantitatively for small separations in the two mentioned models.

We argue that this observable independence is deeply related to the uniformity of the phase-space probability distribution on the hypersurfaces of constant energy. This property is shown explicitly on three different stochastic models, where observable-dependence of the fluctuation-dissipation temperature arises only when the uniformity of the phase-space distribution is broken. The first model is an energy transport model on a ring, with biased local transfer rules. In the second model, defined on a fully connected geometry, energy is exchanged with two heat baths at different temperatures, breaking the uniformity of the phase-space distribution. Finally, in the last model, the system is connected to a zero temperature reservoir, and preserves the uniformity of the phase-space distribution in the relaxation regime, leading to an observable-independent temperature. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

To illustrate the theory, we use stereographic projections to simulate diffusion-limited-aggregation (DLA) on surfaces of constant Gaussian curvature, including the sphere ($K>0$) and pseudo-sphere ($K<0$), which approximate ""bumps"" and ""saddles"" in smooth surfaces, respectively. Although curvature affects the global morphology of the aggregates, the fractal dimension (in the curved metric) is remarkably insensitive to curvature, as long as the particle size is much smaller than the radius of curvature. We conjecture that all aggregates grown by conformally invariant transport on curved surfaces have the same fractal dimension as DLA in the plane. Our simulations suggest, however, that the multifractal dimensions increase from hyperbolic ($K<0$) to elliptic ($K>0$) geometry, which we attribute to curvature-dependent screening of tip branching.

At the same time the entire configuration of types becomes increasing de-correlated. This finding is related to ecosystem evolution. The systems level dynamics of the model is subordinated to intermittent transitions between meta-stable states. We improve on previous studies of the statistics of the transition times and show that the fluctuations in the offspring probability decreases with number of transitions. The longtime adaptation, as seen by an increasing population size is demonstrated to be related to the convexity of the offspring probability. We explain how the models behaviour is a mathematical reflection of Darwin's concept of adaptation of profitable variations. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1003.3095;Propagating rotational jump events drive liquid-liquid transition in  supercooled liquid water; Biman Jana,  Rakesh Saran Singh,  Biman Bagchi;  We observe, at low temperature, the appearance of propagating events that originate from the inter-conversion between adjacent four and five coordinated water molecules in supercooled liquid water, resulting in the migration of the coordination number five in a string-like fashion, creating rotational jumps along the way. The length of the connected events increases with lowering temperature. Each propagation event is terminated by a 3-coordinated species, present in a small number at large supercooling, which interacts cooperatively with 5-coordinated molecules to annihilate both the species. We find that these growing dynamical correlations manifest in a divergent-like growth of a non-linear density response function, \times4(t), which is given by a four point time correlation function (FPTCF). The locus of the maximum of \times4(t), when plotted against the time t* of maximum, exhibits a sharp peak precisely at the temperature where the static response functions (specific heat, isothermal compressibility) also show similar sharp, divergent-like, peak. While the decay of population fluctuation time correlation function of both 4- and 5- coordinated species slows down dramatically and a step-like feature of the relaxation becomes evident, the lifetime itself of 5-corrdinated species remains short. These results suggest a new molecular mechanism of low temperature anomalies and of the liquid-liquid transition in terms of initiation, growth and termination of propagating jump and inter-conversion events. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

In addition, we find that the first-order phase boundary in this softened model ends in a finite-temperature dynamical critical point, which we expect to be present in natural systems. We discuss links between this critical point and quantum phase transitions, showing that dynamical phase transitions in $d$ dimensions map to quantum transitions in the same dimension, and hence to classical thermodynamic phase transitions in $d+1$ dimensions. We make these links explicit through exact mappings between master operators, transfer matrices, and Hamiltonians for quantum spin chains. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

In this model particles can enter the system only at the parent site and exit from one of the sites at the last level. In the bulk they move from the occupied sites to one of their unoccupied downward neighbours, chosen randomly. We show that the steady state current that flow from one level to the next is independent of the exit rate, and increase monotonically with the entry rate and the co-ordination number.

Specifically, we consider the hard-core limit of the model, which allows us to study the effects of the confining potential by exact and very accurate numerical results. We analyze the quantum critical behaviors in the large trap-size limit within the framework of the trap-size scaling (TSS) theory, which introduces a new trap exponent theta to describe the dependence on the trap size. This study is relevant for experiments of confined quasi 1D cold atom systems in optical lattices. At the low-density Mott transition TSS can be shown analytically within the spinless fermion representation of the hard-core limit. The trap-size dependence turns out to be more subtle in the other critical regions, when the corresponding homogeneous system has a nonzero filling f, showing an infinite number of level crossings of the lowest states when increasing the trap size. At the n=1 Mott transition this gives rise to a modulated TSS: the TSS is still controlled by the trap-size exponent theta, but it gets modulated by periodic functions of the trap size. Modulations of the asymptotic power-law behavior is also found in the gapless superfluid region, with additional multiscaling behaviors. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)"

We aim at investigating the question that whether and how the thermodynamic structure is invariant in a multiscale stochastic system. That is, whether the relations between thermodynamic functions of state and process variables remain unchanged when the system is viewed at different time scales and resolutions. Our results show that the dynamics on a fast time scale contribute an entropic term to the ""internal energy function"", $u_S(x)$, for the slow dynamics. Based on the conditional free energy $u_S(x)$, one can then treat the slow dynamics as if the fast dynamics is nonexistent. Furthermore, we show that the free energy, which characterizes the spontaneous organization in a system without detailed balance, is invariant with or without the fast dynamics: The fast dynamics is assumed to reach stationarity instantaneously on the slow time scale; they have no effect on the system's free energy. The same can not be said for the entropy and the internal energy, both of which contain the same contribution from the fast dynamics. We also investigate the consequences of time-scale separation in connection to the concepts of quasi-stationaryty and steady-adiabaticity introduced in the phenomenological steady-state thermodynamics.

Figueiredo;  We study the surface growth generated by the random deposition of particles of different sizes. A model is proposed where the particles are aggregated on an initially flat surface, giving rise to a rough interface and a porous bulk. By using Monte Carlo simulations, a surface has grown by adding particles of different sizes, as well as identical particles on the substrate in (1 + 1) dimensions. In the case of deposition of particles of different sizes, they are selected from a Poisson distribution, where the particle's sizes may vary by one order of magnitude. For the deposition of identical particles, only particles which are larger than one lattice parameter of the substrate are considered. We calculate the usual scaling exponents: the roughness, growth and dynamic exponents $\alpha, \, \beta \,$ and $z$, respectively, as well as, the porosity in the bulk, determining the porosity as a function of the particle size. The results of our simulations show that the roughness evolves in time following three different behaviors. The roughness in the initial times behaves as in the random deposition model. At intermediate times, the surface roughness grows slowly and finally, at long times, it enters into the saturation regime. The bulk formed by depositing large particles reveals a porosity that increases very fast at the initial times, and also reaches a saturation value. Excepting the case where particles have the size of one lattice spacing, we always find that the surface roughness and porosity reach limiting values at long times. Surprisingly, we find that the scaling exponents are the same as those predicted by the Villain-Lai-Das Sarma equation. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1003.3592;Is nonextensive statistics applicable to continuous Hamiltonian systems?; J.P. Boon,  J.F. Lutsko;  The homogeneous entropy for continuous systems in nonextensive statistics reads $S^{H}_{q}=k_B\,{(1 - (K \int d\Gamma \rho^{1/q}(\Gamma))^{q})}/({1-q})$, where $\Gamma$ is the phase space variable. Optimization of $S^{H}_{q}$ combined with normalization and energy constraints gives an implicit expression of the distribution function $\rho (\Gamma)$ which can be computed explicitly for the ideal gas. From this result, we compute properties such as the energy fluctuations and the specific heat. Similar results are also presented using the formulation based on the Tsallis entropy. From the analysis, we discuss the validity of the application of the nonextensive formalism to continuous Hamiltonian systems which is found to be restricted to the range $q<1$, which renders problematic its applicability to the class of phenomena exhibiting power law decay. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1003.3604;Spherical codes, maximal local packing density, and the golden ratio; A. B. Hopkins,  F. H. Stillinger,  S. Torquato;  The densest local packing (DLP) problem in d-dimensional Euclidean space Rd involves the placement of N nonoverlapping spheres of unit diameter near an additional fixed unit-diameter sphere such that the greatest distance from the center of the fixed sphere to the centers of any of the N surrounding spheres is minimized. Solutions to the DLP problem are relevant to the realizability of pair correlation functions for packings of nonoverlapping spheres and might prove useful in improving upon the best known upper bounds on the maximum packing fraction of sphere packings in dimensions greater than three. The optimal spherical code problem in Rd involves the placement of the centers of N nonoverlapping spheres of unit diameter onto the surface of a sphere of radius R such that R is minimized. It is proved that in any dimension, all solutions between unity and the golden ratio to the optimal spherical code problem for N spheres are also solutions to the corresponding DLP problem. It follows that for any packing of nonoverlapping spheres of unit diameter, a spherical region of radius less than or equal to the golden ratio centered on an arbitrary sphere center cannot enclose a number of sphere centers greater than one more than the number that can be placed on the region's surface. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft); Metric Geometry (math.MG)"

Using the Langevin-type dynamics with subordination techniques, we obtain the group velocity which can measure the transport. It is found that the group velocity increases monotonically with the subdiffusive index and there exists an optimal value of the L\'evy index at which the group velocity takes its maximal value. There is a threshold value of the subdiffusive index below which the ratchet effects will disappear. The nonthermal character of the L\'evy flights and the asymmetry of the potential are necessary to obtain the directed transport. Some peculiar phenomena induced by the competition between L\'evy flights and subdiffusion are also observed. The pseudonormal diffusion will appear on the level of the median. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.0011;Exact Constructions of a Family of Dense Periodic Packings of Tetrahedra; S. Torquato,  Y. Jiao;"  The determination of the densest packings of regular tetrahedra (one of the five Platonic solids) is attracting great attention as evidenced by the rapid pace at which packing records are being broken and the fascinating packing structures that have emerged. Here we provide the most general analytical formulation to date to construct dense periodic packings of tetrahedra with four particles per fundamental cell. This analysis results in six-parameter family of dense tetrahedron packings that includes as special cases recently discovered ""dimer"" packings of tetrahedra, including the densest known packings with density $\phi= 4000/4671 = 0.856347...$. This study strongly suggests that the latter set of packings are the densest among all packings with a four-particle basis. Whether they are the densest packings of tetrahedra among all packings is an open question, but we offer remarks about this issue. Moreover, we describe a procedure that provides estimates of upper bounds on the maximal density of tetrahedron packings, which could aid in assessing the packing efficiency of candidate dense packings.

In particular, we focus on the finite-size scaling (FSS) exponent, which is mathematically important and practically useful in analyzing finite systems. Using the FSS theory of nonequilibrium absorbing phase transitions, we show that the density of unsatisfied clauses clearly indicates the transition from the solvable (absorbing) phase to the unsolvable (active) phase as varying the noise parameter and the density of constraints. Based on the solution clustering (percolation-type) argument, we conjecture two possible values of the FSS exponent, which are confirmed reasonably well in numerical simulations for $2\le K \le 3$. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.0393;Introduction to Nonequilibrium Statistical Mechanics with Quantum Field; Takafumi Kita;"  In this article, we present a concise and self-contained introduction to nonequilibrium statistical mechanics with quantum field theory by considering an ensemble of interacting identical bosons or fermions as an example. Readers are assumed to be familiar with the Matsubara formalism of equilibrium statistical mechanics such as Feynman diagrams, the proper self-energy, and Dyson's equation. The aims are threefold: (i) to explain the fundamentals of nonequilibrium quantum field theory as simple as possible on the basis of the knowledge of the equilibrium counterpart; (ii) to elucidate the hierarchy in describing nonequilibrium systems from Dyson's equation on the Keldysh contour to the Navier-Stokes equation in fluid mechanics via quantum transport equations and the Boltzmann equation; (iii) to derive an expression of nonequilibrium entropy that evolves with time. In stage (i), we introduce nonequilibrium Green's function and the self-energy uniquely on the round-trip Keldysh contour, thereby avoiding possible confusions that may arise from defining multiple Green's functions at the very beginning. We try to present the Feynman rules for the perturbation expansion as simple as possible. In particular, we focus on the self-consistent perturbation expansion with the Luttinger-Ward thermodynamic functional, i.e., Baym's Phi-derivable approximation, which has a crucial property for nonequilibrium systems of obeying various conservation laws automatically. We also show how the two-particle correlations can be calculated within the Phi-derivable approximation, i.e., an issue of how to handle the ""Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvons (BBGKY) hierarchy"".

In particular, we numerically compute the fractal dimensions of boundary and bulk interfaces at the Fateev-Zamolodchikov point. This point is a special point on the self-dual critical line of the AT model and it is described in the continuum limit by the Z_4 parafermionic theory. Extending on previous analytical and numerical studies [10,12], we point out the existence of three different values of fractal dimensions which characterize different kind of interfaces. We argue that this result may be related to the classification of primary operators of the parafermionic algebra. The scenario emerging from the studies presented here is expected to unveil general aspects of geometrical objects of critical AT model, and thus of c=1 critical theories in general. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.0534;Phase Behavior of Colloidal Superballs: Shape Interpolation from Spheres  to Cubes; Robert D. Batten,  Frank H. Stillinger,  Salvatore Torquato;  The phase behavior of hard superballs is examined using molecular dynamics within a deformable periodic simulation box. A superball's interior is defined by the inequality $|x|^{2q} + |y|^{2q} + |z|^{2q} \leq 1$, which provides a versatile family of convex particles ($q \geq 0.5$) with cube-like and octahedron-like shapes as well as concave particles ($q < 0.5$) with octahedron-like shapes. Here, we consider the convex case with a deformation parameter q between the sphere point (q = 1) and the cube (q = 1). We find that the asphericity plays a significant role in the extent of cubatic ordering of both the liquid and crystal phases. Calculation of the first few virial coefficients shows that superballs that are visually similar to cubes can have low-density equations of state closer to spheres than to cubes. Dense liquids of superballs display cubatic orientational order that extends over several particle lengths only for large q. Along the ordered, high-density equation of state, superballs with 1 < q < 3 exhibit clear evidence of a phase transition from a crystal state to a state with reduced long-ranged orientational order upon the reduction of density. For $q \geq 3$, long-ranged orientational order persists until the melting transition. The width of coexistence region between the liquid and ordered, high-density phase decreases with q up to q = 4.0. The structures of the high-density phases are examined using certain order parameters, distribution functions, and orientational correlation functions. We also find that a fixed simulation cell induces artificial phase transitions that are out of equilibrium. Current fabrication techniques allow for the synthesis of colloidal superballs, and thus the phase behavior of such systems can be investigated experimentally. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)"

We also found its dependence on the field amplitude and compared the result with the exact value in limiting case. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

Our approach is to introduce an external, static perturbation to extract the structural information from the system's response. In particular, we consider the transformation behavior of the local minima of the underlying potential energy landscape (inherent structures), under a static deformation. The finite-size scaling analysis of our numerical results indicate that the correlation length diverges at a temperature $T_c$, below the temperatures here the system can be equilibrated. Our numerical results are consistent with random first order theory, which predicts such a divergence with a critical exponent $\nu=2/3$ at the Kauzmann temperature, where the extrapolated configurational entropy vanishes. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Disordered Systems and Neural Networks (cond-mat.dis-nn); Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)"

The calculations are done for the crystal at T = 0 and T_m, and for the liquid at T_m. The key theoretical quantities for crystal and liquid are the structural potential and the dynamical matrix, both as function of volume. The theoretical equations are presented, as well as details of the DFT computations. The properties compared with experiment are the equilibrium volume, the isothermal bulk modulus, the internal energy and the entropy. The agreement of theory with experiment is uniformly good. Our primary conclusion is that the application of DFT to V-T theory is feasible, and the resulting liquid calculations achieve the same level of accuracy as does ab initio lattice dynamics for crystals. Moreover, given the well established reliability of DFT, the present results provide a significant confirmation of V-T theory itself. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

We use the local frame defined by the so called Riemann normal coordinates to derive a general formula for the mean-square geodesic distance (MSD) at the short-time regime. This formula is written in terms of $O(d)$ invariants that depend on the Riemann curvature tensor. We study the n-dimensional sphere case to validate these results. We also show that the diffusion for positive constant curvature is slower than the diffusion in a plane space, while the diffusion for negative constant curvature turns out to be faster. Finally the two-dimensional case is emphasized, as it is relevant for the single particle diffusion on biomembranes. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)"

The exact evaluation of the canonical partition function, and the one-body distribution function, in three different shaped pores are achieved. The analyzed simple geometries are the cuboidal, cylindrical and ellipsoidal cavities. Results have been compared with two previously studied geometries, the spherical pore and the spherical pore with a hard core. The search of common features in the analytic structure of the partition functions in terms of their length parameters and their volumes, surface area, edges length and curvatures is addressed too. A general framework for the exact thermodynamic analysis of systems with few and many particles in terms of a set of thermodynamic measures is discussed. We found that an exact thermodynamic description is feasible based in the adoption of an adequate set of measures and the search of the free energy dependence on the adopted measure set. A relation similar to the Laplace equation for the fluid-vapor interface is obtained which express the equilibrium between magnitudes that in extended systems are intensive variables. This exact description is applied to study the thermodynamic behavior of the two Hard Spheres in a Hard Wall Pore for the analyzed different geometries.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.0757;Statistical mechanics of Floquet systems with regular and chaotic states; Roland Ketzmerick,  Waltraut Wustmann;  We investigate the asymptotic state of time-periodic quantum systems with regular and chaotic Floquet states weakly coupled to a heat bath. The asymptotic occupation probabilities of these two types of states follow fundamentally different distributions. Among regular states the probability decreases from the state in the center of a regular island to the outermost state by orders of magnitude, while chaotic states have almost equal probabilities. We derive an analytical expression for the occupations of regular states of kicked systems, which depends on the winding numbers of the regular tori and the parameters temperature and driving frequency. For a constant winding number within a regular island it simplifies to Boltzmann-like weights $\exp(-\betaeff \Ereg_m)$, similar to time-independent systems. For this we introduce the regular energies $\Ereg_m$ of the quantizing tori and an effective winding-number-dependent temperature $1/\betaeff$, different from the actual bath temperature. Furthermore, the occupations of other typical Floquet states in a mixed phase space are studied, i.e. regular states on nonlinear resonances, beach states, and hierarchical states, giving rise to distinct features in the occupation distribution. Avoided crossings involving a regular state lead to drastic consequences for the entire set of occupations. We introduce a simplified rate model whose analytical solutions describe the occupations quite accurately. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

To this end we calculate the entropy production for a population model that displays nonequilibrium behavior resulting from cyclic competition. At a critical point the dynamics exhibits a transition from large, limit-cycle like oscillations to small, erratic oscillations. We show that the entropy production peaks very close to the critical point and tends to zero upon deviating from it. We further provide analytical methods for computing the entropy production which agree excellently with numerical simulations. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph); Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)"

This first passage probability decays algebraically, G_n ~ n^{-2}, when n is large. We also derive the probability that a tie ever happens. This probability is between zero and one, so that a tie may occur in some realizations but not in others.

We provide a critical test of this property and show that the theory fails to describe the qualitatively distinct dynamical behavior obtained in two model liquids characterized by very similar pair correlation functions. Because we use `exact' static information provided by numerical simulations, our results are a direct proof that some important information about the dynamics of viscous liquids is not captured by pair correlations, and is thus not described by the mode-coupling theory, even in the temperature regime where the theory is usually applied. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

A classical simple fluid with a locally introduced field simulating a solid is considered. For the case of a hard-core field, rigid, exponential, realistic, and macroscopically smooth boundaries are examined. Two approaches to this problem are analyzed. With some degree of arbitrariness, they can be referred to as ""adsorption"" vs ""surface tension"" or ""cluster expansion"" vs ""pressure tensor"". The ""adsorption"" approach is used to obtain a series in powers of the activity for gamma. For Mayer-type expansion the integrals of the Ursell functions contain factors which depend on the particle/wall interaction potential. In the case of a hard wall, the coefficients of the series reduce to the first moments of the Ursell functions taken over certain regions. The ""surface tension"" approach is used to expand the Kirkwood-Buff formula for gamma to the arbitrary localization of the dividing surface. ""The surface tension coefficient"" breaks up into the term proportional to the Henry constant, depending on the dividing surface position, and universal nonlinear surface coefficient. It is shown that the derivative of the tangential component of the pressure tensor with respect to the chemical potential coincides with the near-surface number density on average over the transition region, that has two consequences. Firstly, it proves complete identity between ""tension"" and ""adsorption"" approaches in the domain of their existence. Secondly, it gives the near-surface virial expansion, which determines the exact equation of state of near boundary ""two-dimensional"" fluid. The tangential component of the pressure tensor averaged over the transition region plays the role of pressure, and the average number density - the role of number density.

Banavar,  Amos Maritan;  Ecological communities exhibit pervasive patterns and inter-relationships between size, abundance, and the availability of resources. We use scaling ideas to develop a unified, model-independent framework for understanding the distribution of tree sizes, their energy use and spatial distribution in tropical forests. We demonstrate that the scaling of the tree crown at the individual level drives the forest structure when resources are fully used. Our predictions match perfectly with the scaling behaviour of an exactly solvable self-similar model of a forest and are in good accord with empirical data. The range, over which pure power law behaviour is observed, depends on the available amount of resources. The scaling framework can be used for assessing the effects of natural and anthropogenic disturbances on ecosystem structure and functionality. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.1271;Exact solution for a diffusive nonequilibrium steady state of an open  quantum chain; Marko Znidaric;  We calculate a nonequilibrium steady state of a quantum XX chain in the presence of dephasing and driving due to baths at chain ends. The obtained state is exact in the limit of weak driving while the expressions for one- and two-point correlations are exact for an arbitrary driving strength. In the steady state the magnetization profile and the spin current display diffusive behavior. Spin-spin correlation function on the other hand has long-range correlations which though decay to zero in either the thermodynamical limit or for equilibrium driving. At zero dephasing a nonequilibrium phase transition occurs from a ballistic transport having short-range correlations to a diffusive transport with long-range correlations. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

DubÃ©;  Adaptive networks have been recently introduced in the context of disease propagation on complex networks. They account for the mutual interaction between the network topology and the states of the nodes. Until now, existing models have been analyzed using low-complexity analytic formalisms, revealing nevertheless some novel dynamical features. However, current methods have failed to reproduce with accuracy the simultaneous time evolution of the disease and the underlying network topology. In the framework of the adaptive SIS model of Gross et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 208701 (2006)], we introduce an improved compartmental formalism able to handle this coevolutionary task successfully. With this approach, we analyze the interplay and outcomes of both dynamical elements, process and structure, on adaptive networks featuring different degree distributions at the initial stage. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph); Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.1334;On conjectured local generalizations of anisotropic scale invariance and  their implications; S. Rutkevich,  H. W. Diehl,  M. A. Shpot;"  The theory of generalized local scale invariance of strongly anisotropic scale invariant systems proposed some time ago by Henkel [Nucl. Phys. B \textbf{641}, 405 (2002)] is examined. The case of so-called type-I systems is considered. This was conjectured to be realized by systems at m-axial Lifshitz points; in support of this claim, scaling functions of two-point cumulants at the uniaxial Lifshitz point of the three-dimensional ANNNI model were predicted on the basis of this theory and found to be in excellent agreement with Monte Carlo results [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{87}, 125702 (2001)]. The consequences of the conjectured invariance equations are investigated. It is shown that fewer solutions than anticipated by Henkel generally exist and contribute to the scaling functions if these equations are assumed to hold for all (positive and negative) values of the d-dimensional space (or space time) coordinates $(t,\bm{r})\in \mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^{d-1}$. Specifically, a single rather than two independent solutions exists in the case relevant for the mentioned fit of Monte Carlo data for the ANNNI model. Renormalization-group improved perturbation theory in $4+m/2-\epsilon$ dimensions is used to determine the scaling functions of the order-parameter and energy-density two-point cumulants in momentum space to two-loop order. The results are mathematically incompatible with Henkel's predictions except in free-field-theory cases. However, the scaling function of the energy-density cumulant we obtain for m=1 upon extrapolation of our two-loop RG results to d=3 differs numerically little from that of an effective free field theory.

DubÃ©;  Analytical description of propagation phenomena on random networks has flourished in recent years, yet more complex systems have mainly been studied through numerical means. In this paper, a mean-field description is used to coherently couple the dynamics of the network elements (nodes, vertices, individuals...) on the one hand and their recurrent topological patterns (subgraphs, groups...) on the other hand. In a SIS model of epidemic spread on social networks with community structure, this approach yields a set of ODEs for the time evolution of the system, as well as analytical solutions for the epidemic threshold and equilibria. The results obtained are in good agreement with numerical simulations and reproduce random networks behavior in the appropriate limits which highlights the influence of topology on the processes. Finally, it is demonstrated that our model predicts higher epidemic thresholds for clustered structures than for equivalent random topologies in the case of networks with zero degree correlation. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph); Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)"

Near the fluid-solid phase transition, there exist three regimes in the relaxation of the pair orientational autocorrelation function, namely the kinetic, molasses (stretched exponential), and diffusional power decay. The density dependence of both the molasses and diffusional power regimes are evaluated and the latter compares with theoretical predictions in three dimensions. The largest cluster at the freezing density of only a few sphere diameter in size persist for only about 30 picoseconds (~ 2.8 x 10^{-11}[s]). The most striking observation through the bond orientatinal order parameter is the dramatic increase of the cluster size as the freezing density is approached. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)"

We explicitly describe the data structures and algorithms used, and provide a heuristic argument that the mean time per attempted pivot for $N$-step self-avoiding walks is $O(1)$ for the square and simple cubic lattices. Numerical experiments conducted for self-avoiding walks with up to 268 million steps are consistent with $o(\log N)$ behavior for the square lattice and $O(\log N)$ behavior for the simple cubic lattice. Our method can be adapted to other models of polymers with short-range interactions, on the lattice or in the continuum, and hence promises to be widely useful. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)"

We show that in nonequilibrium a new type of singularities can appear that are interpreted as phase transitions. In particular, this phenomenon occurs for the one-dimensional boundary driven weakly asymmetric exclusion process when the drift due to the external field is opposite to the one due to the external reservoirs, and strong enough. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

Often these processes take place in one-dimensional systems offering several tracks to the particles, and in many cases the particles are able to change track with a given rate. In this work we consider the case of strong coupling where the hopping rate along the tracks and the exchange rates are of the same order, and show how a phenomenological approach based on a domain wall theory can describe the dynamics of the system. In particular, the domain walls on the different tracks form pairs, whose dynamics dominate the behavior of the system. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

Invisible states affect the entropy and the free energy, although they do not contribute to the internal energy. The internal energy and the number of degenerated ground states do not change, if invisible states are introduced into the standard Potts model. A second-order phase transition takes place at finite temperature in the standard $q$-state ferromagnetic Potts model on two-dimensional lattice for $q=2,3$, and 4. However, our present model on two-dimensional lattice undergoes a first-order phase transition with spontaneous $q$-fold symmetry breaking ($q=2,3$, and 4) due to entropy effect of invisible states. We believe that our present model is a fundamental model for analysis of a first-order phase transition with spontaneous discrete symmetry breaking. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Disordered Systems and Neural Networks (cond-mat.dis-nn)"

Hoover,  Carol G. Hoover,  Francisco J. Uribe;  Macroscopic models which distinguish the longitudinal and transverse temperatures can provide improved descriptions of the microscopic shock structures as revealed by molecular dynamics simulations. Additionally, we can include three relaxation times in the models, two based on Maxwell's viscoelasticity and its Cattaneo-equation analog for heat flow, and a third thermal, based on the Krook-Boltzmann equation. This approach can replicate the observed lags of stress (which lags behind the strain rate) and heat flux (which lags behind the temperature gradient), as well as the eventual equilibration of the two temperatures. For profile stability the time lags cannot be too large. By partitioning the longitudinal and transverse contributions of work and heat and including a tensor heat conductivity and bulk viscosity, all the qualitative microscopic features of strong simple-fluid shockwave structures can be reproduced. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD)"

The interesting regime arises when b is of the order of but less than 1, where the conditional exit time to reach L, corresponding to an infected state, has a non-monotonic dependence on initial position. Both the exit probability and the infection time exhibit complex dependences on the initial condition due to the interplay between the burst length and interval length.

In this respect such models are highly unrealistic, most real networks having strongly non-tree-like neighborhoods that contain short loops, cliques, or other biconnected subgraphs. In this paper we propose and analyze a new class of random graph models that incorporates general subgraphs, allowing for non-tree-like neighborhoods while still remaining solvable for many fundamental network properties. Among other things we give solutions for the size of the giant component, the position of the phase transition at which the giant component appears, and percolation properties for both site and bond percolation on networks generated by the model. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM); Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.1678;Short-Time Critical Dynamics of Damage Spreading in the Two-Dimensional  Ising Model; M. Leticia Rubio Puzzo,  Ezequiel V. Albano;  The short-time critical dynamics of propagation of damage in the Ising ferromagnet in two dimensions is studied by means of Monte Carlo simulations. Starting with equilibrium configurations at $T= \infty$ and magnetization $M=0$, an initial damage is created by flipping a small amount of spins in one of the two replicas studied. In this way, the initial damage is proportional to the initial magnetization $M_0$ in one of the configurations upon quenching the system at $T_C$, the Onsager critical temperature of the ferromagnetic-paramagnetic transition. It is found that, at short times, the damage increases with an exponent $\theta_D=1.915(3)$, which is much larger than the exponent $\theta=0.197$ characteristic of the initial increase of the magnetization $M(t)$. Also, an epidemic study was performed. It is found that the average distance from the origin of the epidemic ($\langle R^2(t)\rangle$) grows with an exponent $z^* \approx \eta \approx 1.9$, which is the same, within error bars, as the exponent $\theta_D$. However, the survival probability of the epidemics reaches a plateau so that $\delta=0$. On the other hand, by quenching the system to lower temperatures one observes the critical spreading of the damage at $T_{D}\simeq 0.51 T_C$, where all the measured observables exhibit power laws with exponents $\theta_D = 1.026(3)$, $\delta = 0.133(1)$, and $z^*=1.74(3)$. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

Yet, there exists numerous examples in living systems where supply tree networks have to deliver products in a limited time due to the pulsatile character of the flow. This is the case for mammals respiration for which air has to reach the gas exchange units before the start of expiration. We report here that introducing a systematic branching asymmetry allows to reduce the average delivery time of the products. It simultaneously increases its robustness against the unevitable variability of sizes related to morphogenesis. We then apply this approach to the human tracheobronchial tree. We show that in this case all extremities are supplied with fresh air, provided that the asymmetry is smaller than a critical threshold which happens to fit with the asymmetry measured in the human lung. This could indicate that the structure is adjusted at the maximum asymmetry level that allows to feed all terminal units with fresh air. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph); Medical Physics (physics.med-ph)"

The crucial technical point is extending the usual one species coagulation dynamics to the two species one. This is achieved by means of introducing explicitly solvable kernels which have a clear physical meaning. The corresponding solutions are calculated in the long time limit, in which consensus may or may not be reached. The lack of consensus is characterized by means of scaling limits of the solutions. The possible applications of our results to some topics in which consensus reaching is fundamental, like collective animal motion and opinion spreading dynamics, are also outlined. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems (nlin.AO); Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI)"

It is shown that such a dependence can be thought in terms of the isomorphism of the Vicsek model with the Kuramoto model of spontaneous synchronization. They are isomorphic at least within the mean-field approach. The isomorphism between two models allows to state the dependence of the type of the transition in Vicsek model on the noise perturbation. Two types of noise the scalar and the vector ones lead to qualitatively different behavior with continuous and the discontinuous transition to ordered state correspondingly. New type of the stochastic perturbation - ``mixed`` noise is proposed. It is the weighted superposition of the scalar and vector noises. The corresponding phase diagram ``noise amplitude vs. interaction strength`` is obtained and the tricritical behavior for Vicsek model is demonstrated. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.2143;Eight-order mosaic structure theory of the glass transition and  macromolecular motion; Jia-Lin Wu;  A universal theoretical framework has been proposed that the solid-to-liquid glass transition and macromolecular motion within the entire temperature range from Tg to Tm and the liquid flow are absolutely determined by the intrinsic 8 orders of transient 2-D mosaic geometric structures formed by exciting interfaces. Interface excitations are cross-coupled electron pairs, which attribute to the Van der Waals repulsion electron-electron pairs with 2-D self-avoiding closed loops existing in any random system at any temperature. An interface excitation state is a vector with 8 orders of additional restoring torque, 8 orders of relaxation times, quantized energies and extra volumes. Dynamics occurred by the slow inverse cascade generates the 8 orders of potential loop-flows while the fast cascade rearranges the structure. The delocalization mode is solitary wave along the 8 orders of geodesic. Solitary wave is derived from the balance between inverse cascade and cascade. Increasing temperature only increases the number of inverse cascade and cascade. This model provides a unified mechanism to interpret ripplon, reptation, Boson peak, Ising model, non-ergodic, free volume, hard-sphere, tunneling, cage, compacting cluster, jamming behaviors, breaking solid lattice, geometrical frustration, potential energy landscape, flow-percolation, thermo-disorder-induced localized energy, average energy of cooperative migration along one direction, critical entanglement chain length, and Reynolds number, solitary wave, heteroclinic orbit in hydrodynamics. This model also directly deduces the Lindemann ratio, the famous 3.4 power law of viscosity of entangled macromolecules and the well-known WLF equation and shows that the Clapeyron equation governing all first order phase transitions in thermodynamics only holds true in each subsystem, instead of the system in glass transition. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)"

It was found that the secondary parameters of the ion beam (beam profile and variations of an incidence angle) can crucially change the topology of patterns and the corresponding dynamics. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

As opposed to previous realizations of explosive percolation our models obtain Gaussian cluster distributions and compact clusters as one would expect at first-order transitions. We also discover that the cluster perimeters are fractal at the transition point, yielding a fractal dimension of $1.23\pm0.03$, close to that of watersheds. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.2649;System size scaling of topological defect creation in a second-order  dynamical quantum phase transition; Michael Uhlmann,  Ralf SchÃ¼tzhold,  Uwe R. Fischer;  We investigate the system size scaling of the net defect number created by a rapid quench in a second-order quantum phase transition from an O(N) symmetric state to a phase of broken symmetry. Using a controlled mean-field expansion for large N, we find that the net defect number variance in convex volumina scales like the surface area of the sample for short-range correlations. This behaviour follows generally from spatial and internal symmetries. Conversely, if spatial isotropy is broken, e.g., by a lattice, and in addition long-range periodic correlations develop in the broken-symmetry phase, we get the rather counterintuitive result that the scaling strongly depends on the dimension being even or odd: For even dimensions, the net defect number variance scales like the surface area squared, with a prefactor oscillating with the system size, while for odd dimensions, it essentially vanishes. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.2818;Voter model on a directed network: Role of bidirectional opinion  exchanges; Sung-Guk Han,  Jaegon Um,  Beom Jun Kim;  The voter model with the node update rule is numerically investigated on a directed network. We start from a directed hierarchical tree, and split and rewire each incoming arc at the probability $p$. In order to discriminate the better and worse opinions, we break the $Z_2$ symmetry ($\sigma = \pm 1$) by giving a little more preference to the opinion $\sigma = 1$. It is found that as $p$ becomes larger, introducing more complicated pattern of information flow channels, and as the network size $N$ becomes larger, the system eventually evolves to the state in which more voters agree on the better opinion, even though the voter at the top of the hierarchy keeps the worse opinion. We also find that the pure hierarchical tree makes opinion agreement very fast, while the final absorbing state can easily be influenced by voters at the higher ranks. On the other hand, although the ordering occurs much slower, the existence of complicated pattern of bidirectional information flow allows the system to agree on the better opinion. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)"

We find an on-the-fly simulation approach of switching optimization is a special case of the nonequilibrium process under feedback control. In this approach, the switching rate is allowed to vary during the simulation and the optimization is done on-the-fly by utilizing the part of the simulation outcomes as the feedback information.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.3150;Scaling of bipartite entanglement in one-dimensional lattice systems  with a trapping potential; Massimo Campostrini,  Ettore Vicari;  We study the effects of a power-law trapping potential on the scaling behaviour of the entanglement at the quantum critical point of one-dimensional (1D) lattice particle systems. We compute bipartite von Neumann and Renyi entropies in the presence of the trap, and analyze their scaling behaviour with increasing the trap size. As a theoretical laboratory, we consider the quantum XY chain in an external transverse field acting as a trap for the spinless fermions of its quadratic Hamiltonian representation. We then investigate confined particle systems described by the 1D Bose-Hubbard model in the superfluid phase (around the center of the trap). In both cases conformal field theory predicts logarithmically divergent bipartite entanglement entropies for the homogeneous systems without trap. The presence of the trapping potential breaks conformal invariance, affecting the critical behaviour of the homogeneous system. Our results show that the bipartite entanglement entropies diverge logarithmically with increasing the trap size, and present notable scaling behaviours in the trap-size scaling limit. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.3229;Partition-Induced Vector Chromatography in Microfluidic Devices; Jorge A. Bernate,  German Drazer;  The transport of Brownian particles in a slit geometry in the presence of an arbitrary two-dimensional periodic energy landscape and driven by an external force or convected by a flow field is investigated by means of macrotransport theory. Analytical expressions for the probability distribution and the average migration angle of the particles are obtained under the Fick-Jackobs approximation. The migration angle is shown to differ from the orientation angle of the driving field and to strongly depend on the physical properties of the suspended species, thus providing the basis for vector chormatography, in which different species move in different directions and can be continuously fractionated. The potential of microfluidic devices as a platform for partition-induced vector chromatography is demonstrated by considering the particular case of a piece-wise constant, periodic potential that, in equilibrium, induces the spontaneous partition of different species into high and low concentration stripes, and which can be easily fabricated by patterning physically or chemically one of the surfaces of a channel. The feasibility to separate different particles of the same and different size is shown for systems in which partition is induced via 1g-gravity and Van der Waals interactions in physically and chemically patterned channels, respectively. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)"

From the equations for the Hermitian moments, we show how the system relaxes towards the mechanical equilibrium. In the space of the parallel generalized frictions, after fast transients, the evolution of collisional magnetically confined plasmas is such that the projections of the evolution equations for the parallel generalized frictions and the shortest path on the Hermitian moments coincide. For spatially-extended systems, a similar result is valid for the evolution of the {\it thermodynamic mode} (i.e., the mode with wave-number k = 0). The expression for the affine connection of the space covered by the generalized frictions, close to mechanical equilibria, is also obtained. The knowledge of the components of the affine connection is a fundamental prerequisite for the construction of the (nonlinear) closure theory on transport processes. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)"

Our study is motivated by recent experiments that demonstrated superdiffusion of light in complex disordered materials, thereby termed L\'evy glasses. We introduce a geometric parameter $\alpha$ which plays a role analogous to the exponent characterizing the step length distribution in random systems. We study the large-time behavior of both local and average observables; for the latter case, we distinguish two different types of averages, respectively over the set of all initial sites and over the scattering sites only. The ""single long jump approximation"" is applied to analytically determine the different asymptotic behaviours as a function of $\alpha$ and to understand their origin. We also discuss the possibility that the root of the mean square displacement and the characteristic length of the walker distribution may grow according to different power laws; this anomalous behaviour is typical of processes characterized by L\'evy statistics and here, in particular, it is shown to influence average quantities.

This temperature has predictive power for the moment configurations and is intimately related to how the moments are driven by an oscillating external field. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall); Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)"

This extends the existing series for the square lattice by 32 terms, to order q^{-79}. On the triangular lattice, we verify Baxter's analytical expression for the bulk free energy (to order q^{-40}), and we are able to conjecture exact product formulae for the surface and corner free energies. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)"

Translocation is driven by irreversible random sequential absorption of chaperone proteins that bind to the polymer on one side of the membrane. The proteins are larger than the pore and hence the backward motion of the polymer is inhibited. This mechanism rectifies Brownian fluctuations and results in an effective force that drags the polymer in a preferred direction. The translocated polymer undergoes an effective biased random walk and we compute the corresponding diffusion constant. Our methods allow us to determine the large deviation function which, in addition to velocity and diffusion constant, contains the entire statistics of the translocated length. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

The amplitude of the confining potential is varied in time along a power-law ramp such that the many-particle system finally reaches or crosses a critical point. Under this protocol we derive general scaling laws for the density of excitations created during the non-adiabatic sweep of the confining potential. It is found that the mean excitation density follows an algebraic law as a function of the sweeping rate with an exponent that depends on the space-time properties of the potential. We confirm our scaling laws by first order adiabatic calculation and exact results on the Ising quantum chain with a varying transverse field. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.3763;Adiabatic dynamics of an inhomogeneous quantum phase transition: the  case of z > 1 dynamical exponent; Jacek Dziarmaga,  Marek M. Rams;  We consider an inhomogeneous quantum phase transition across a multicritical point of the XY quantum spin chain. This is an example of a Lifshitz transition with a dynamical exponent z = 2. Just like in the case z = 1 considered in New J. Phys. 12, 055007 (2010) when a critical front propagates much faster than the maximal group velocity of quasiparticles vq, then the transition is effectively homogeneous: density of excitations obeys a generalized Kibble-Zurek mechanism and scales with the sixth root of the transition rate. However, unlike for z = 1, the inhomogeneous transition becomes adiabatic not below vq but a lower threshold velocity v', proportional to inhomogeneity of the transition, where the excitations are suppressed exponentially. Interestingly, the adiabatic threshold v' is nonzero despite vanishing minimal group velocity of low energy quasiparticles. In the adiabatic regime below v' the inhomogeneous transition can be used for efficient adiabatic quantum state preparation in a quantum simulator: the time required for the critical front to sweep across a chain of N spins adiabatically is merely linear in N, while the corresponding time for a homogeneous transition across the multicritical point scales with the sixth power of N. What is more, excitations after the adiabatic inhomogeneous transition, if any, are brushed away by the critical front to the end of the spin chain. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

The phase diagram, represented in terms of the dual transmissivity vector, presents four magnetic phases and nine critical points. We have also numerically calculated the correlation length ($\nu_T$) and crossover ($\phi$) critical exponents, which show that seven of the critical points are in the Potts model universality class ($q=2$, 4 e 8). The remaining critical points are in a universality class which may belong to the Baxter's line.

In particular, we find a phase transition from exponentially decaying to long range spin-spin correlations in integrable Heisenberg XXZ chain by changing the anisotropy parameter. Long range order also typically emerges after breaking the integrability of the model. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

Then, it falls on air. The main responsible for the friction force against the movement is the wake of successive air vortices which form behind (above) the falling ball, a turbulent phenomenon. After the wake appears, the friction force compensates the Earth gravitational attraction and the ball speed stabilises in a certain limiting value Vl. Before the formation of the turbulent wake, however, the friction force is not strong enough, allowing the initially growing speed to surpass the future final value Vl. Only after the wake finally becomes long enough, the ball speed decreases and reaches the proper Vl. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Classical Physics (physics.class-ph)"

An external force field F(z) acts in the x direction parallel to the interface, creating a lateral order parameter current j^x(z) which varies with distance z from the interface. Above the roughening temperature, our data for `shear-like' linear variation of F(z) are in agreement with the picture wherein shear acts as effective confinement in this system, thus supressing the interfacial capillary-wave fluctuations. We find sharper magnetisation profiles and reduced interfacial width as compared to equilibrium. Pair correlations are more suppressed in the vorticity direction y than in the driving direction; the opposite holds for the structure factor. Lateral transport of capillary waves occurs for those forms of F(z) for which the current j^x(z) is an odd function of z, for example the shear-like drive, and a `step-like' driving field. For a V-shaped driving force no such motion occurs, but capillary waves are suppressed more strongly than for the shear-like drive. These findings are in agreement with our previous simulation studies in two dimensions. Near and below the (equilibrium) roughening temperature the effective-confinement picture ceases to work, but the lateral motion of the interface persists.

The presence of feedback control in physical systems should modify both Jarzynski equality and detailed fluctuation theorem [K. H. Kim and H. Qian, Phys. Rev. E {\bf 75}, 022102 (2007)]. However, the generalized Jarzynski equality under forward feedback control has been proved by consider that the physical systems under feedback control should locally satisfies the detailed fluctuation theorem. We use the same formalism and derive the generalized detailed fluctuation theorem under nonequilibrium feedback control. It is well known that the exponential average in one direction limits the calculation of precise free energy differences. The knowledge of measurements from both directions usually gives improved results. In this aspect, the generalized detailed fluctuation theorem can be very useful in free energy calculations for system driven under nonequilibrium feedback control. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)"

However, there exist controversial simulation results which have huge discrepancies with experimental ones in literatures. In this paper, we demonstrate that the fluctuation in calculated thermal conductivity is due to the uncertainty in determination of the truncation time, which is related to the ensemble and size dependent phonon relaxation time. We thus propose a new scheme in the direct integration of heat current autocorrelation function (HCACF) and a nonzero correction in the double-exponential-fitting of HCACF to describe correctly the contribution to thermal conductivity from low frequency phonons. By using crystalline Silicon (Si) and Germanium (Ge) as examples, we demonstrate that our method can give rise to the values of thermal conductivity in an excellent agreement with experimental ones. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

We focus here on the smallest eigenvalue which serves as an important measure of entanglement between the two subsystems. In the hard edge case (when the two subsystems have equal sizes) one can fully characterize the probability distribution of the minimum eigenvalue for real, complex and quaternion matrices of all sizes. In particular, we discuss the important finite size effect due to the {\em fixed trace constraint}. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0097;Force Induced Unzipping of DNA with Long Range Correlated Noise; Pui-Man Lam,  Yi Zhen;  We derive and solve a Fokker-Planck equation for the stationary distribution of the free energy, in a model of unzipping of double-stranded DNA under external force. The autocorrelation function of the random DNA sequence can be a general form, including long range correlations. In the case of Orstein-Uhlenbeck noise, characterized by a finite correlation length, our result reduces to the exact result of Allahverdyan et al, with the average number of unzipped base pairs going as <X>~1/f^2 in the white noise limit, where f is the deviation from the critical force. In the case of long range correlated noise, where the integrated autocorrelation is divergent, we find that <X> is finite at f=0, with its value decreasing as the correlations become longer range. This shows that long range correlations actually stabilize the DNA sequence against unzipping. Our result is also in agreement with the findings of Allahverdyan et al, obtained using numerical generation of the long range correlated noise. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft); Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0157;Quasi-stationary simulations of the contact process on quenched networks; Silvio C. Ferreira,  Ronan S. Ferreira,  Claudio Castellano,  Romualdo Pastor-Satorras;  We present high-accuracy quasi-stationary (QS) simulations of the contact process in quenched networks, built using the configuration model with both structural and natural cutoffs. The critical behavior is analyzed in the framework of the anomalous finite size scaling which was recently shown to hold for the contact process on annealed networks. It turns out that the quenched topology does not qualitatively change the critical behavior, leading only (as expected) to a shift of the transition point. The anomalous finite size scaling holds with exactly the same exponents of the annealed case, so that we can conclude that heterogeneous mean-field theory works for the contact process on quenched networks, at odds with previous claims. Interestingly, topological correlations induced by the presence of the natural cutoff do not alter the picture. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0299;Effect of disorder on temporal fluctuations in drying induced cracking; Gabriel Villalobos,  Ferenc Kun,  JosÃ© D. MuÃ±oz;  We investigate by means of computer simulations the effect of structural disorder on the statistics of cracking for a thin layer of material under uniform and isotropic drying. The layer is discretized into a triangular lattice of springs. The drying process is captured by reducing the natural length of all springs by the same factor, and the amount of quenched disorder is controlled by varying the width {\xi} of the distribution of the random breaking thresholds for the springs. Once a spring breaks, redistribution of the load may trigger an avalanche of breaks. Our simulations revealed that the system exhibits a phase transition with the amount of disorder as control parameter: at low disorders, the breaking process is dominated by a macroscopic crack at the beginning, and the size distribution of the subsequent breaking avalanches shows an exponential form. At high disorders, the fracturing proceeds in small-sized avalanches with an exponential distribution, generating a large number of micro-cracks which eventually merge and break the layer. Between both phases a sharp transition occurs at a critical amount of disorder {\xi}_c = 0.40 \pm 0.01, where the avalanche size distribution becomes a power law with exponent {\tau} = 2.6 \pm 0.08, in agreement with the mean-field value {\tau} = 5/2 of the fiber bundle model. Good quality data collapses from the finite-size scaling analysis show that the average value of the largest burst <\Delta_max> can be identified as the order parameter, with {\beta}/{\nu} = 1.4 and 1/{\nu} = 1.0, and that the average ratio <m2 /m1> of the second m2 and first moments m1 of the avalanche size distribution shows similar behaviour to the susceptibility of a continuous transition, with {\gamma}/{\nu} = 1., 1/{\nu} = 0.9. These suggest that the disorder induced transition of the breakup of thin layers is analogous to a continuous phase transition. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0308;Contact-Density Analysis of Lattice Polymer Adsorption Transitions; Michael Bachmann;  By means of contact-density chain-growth simulations, we investigate a simple lattice model of a flexible polymer interacting with an attractive substrate. The contact density is a function of the numbers of monomer-substrate and monomer-monomer contacts. These contact numbers represent natural order parameters and allow for a comprising statistical study of the conformational space accessible to the polymer in dependence of external parameters such as the attraction strength of the substrate and the temperature. Since the contact density is independent of the energy scales associated to the interactions, its logarithm is an unbiased measure for the entropy of the conformational space. By setting explicit energy scales, the thus defined, highly general microcontact entropy can easily be related to the microcanonical entropy of the corresponding hybrid polymer-substrate system. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Biomolecules (q-bio.BM)"

For such processes, we sketch a general approach (based on the Feynman-Kac formalism) that is amenable to explicit expressions for the moments of the number of collisions and the residence time that the walker spends in a given volume as a function of the particle equilibrium distribution. We then illustrate the proposed method in the case of the so-called {\em rod problem} (a 1d system), and discuss the relevance of the obtained results in the context of Monte Carlo estimators. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

However, the various existing methods exhibit extreme differences in their efficiency, depending on model details and relevant questions. The original standard method, Metropolis Monte Carlo, which provides only reliable statistical information at a given (not too low) temperature has meanwhile been replaced by more sophisticated methods which are typically far more efficient (the differences in time scales can be compared with the age of the universe). However, none of the methods yields automatically accurate results, i.e., a system-specific adaptation and control is always needed. Thus, as in any good experiment, the most important part of the data analysis is statistical error estimation. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)"

Limmer,  David Chandler;  We use numerical simulation to examine the possibility of a reversible liquid-liquid transition in supercooled water and related systems. In particular, for two atomistic models of water, we have computed free energies as functions of multiple order parameters, where one is density and another distinguishes crystal from liquid. For a range of temperatures and pressures, separate free energy basins for liquid and crystal are found, conditions of phase coexistence between these phases are demonstrated, and time scales for equilibration are determined. We find that at no range of temperatures and pressures is there more than a single liquid basin, even at conditions where amorphous behavior is unstable with respect to the crystal. We find a similar result for a related model of silicon. This result excludes the possibility of the proposed liquid-liquid critical point for the models we have studied. Further, we argue that behaviors others have attributed to a liquid-liquid transition in water and related systems are in fact reflections of transitions between liquid and crystal. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Disordered Systems and Neural Networks (cond-mat.dis-nn); Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)"

We derive analytical formula for the exit probability and show that it agrees perfectly with Monte Carlo simulations. The puzzle, that we deal with here, may be contained in a simple question: ""Why the mean field approach gives the exact formula for the exit probability in the one-dimensional nonlinear $q$-voter model?"". To answer this question we test several hypothesis proposed recently for the Sznajd model, including the finite size effects, the influence of the range of interactions and the importance of the initial step of the evolution. On the one hand, our work is part of a trend of the current debate on the form of the exit probability in the one-dimensional Sznajd model but on the other hand, it concerns the much broader problem of nonlinear $q$-voter model.

Mean-field theory predicts three phases: inactive (absorbing), active symmetric, and active asymmetric, the latter exhibiting distinct sublattice densities on a bipartite lattice. These phases are separated by continuous transitions; the phase diagram is reentrant. Monte Carlo simulations in two dimensions verify these predictions qualitatively, except for a first-neighbor creation rate of zero. (In the latter case one of the phase transitions is discontinuous.) Our numerical results confirm that the symmetric-asymmetric transition belongs to the Ising universality class, and that the active-absorbing transition belongs to the directed percolation class, as expected from symmetry considerations.

This approach allows us to construct the probability density function (PDF) without a need to solve the GFPE. We employ our method to obtain the GFPE and PDFs for free generalized Brownian motion and the one in harmonic potential for the case of power-law correlation function of the noise. We prove the fact that the considered systems may be described with Einstein-Smoluchowski equation at high viscosity levels and long times. We also compare the results with those obtained by other authors. At last, we calculate PDF of thermodynamical work in the stochastic system which consists of a particle embedded in a harmonic potential moving with constant velocity, and check the work fluctuation theorem for such a system. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

An eigenfunction expansion shows that the Boltzmann equilibrium density does not fully describe the long time limit of this problem. Instead this limit is characterized by an infinite covariant density. This non-normalizable density yields the mean square displacement of the particles, which for a certain range of parameters exhibits anomalous diffusion. In a symmetric potential with an asymmetric initial condition, the average position decays anomalously slowly. This problem also has applications outside the thermal context, as in the diffusion of the momenta of atoms in optical molasses. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph)"

Hovhannisyan,  Dominik Janzing,  Guenter Mahler;  We study dynamic cooling, where an externally driven two-level system is cooled via reservoir, a quantum system with initial canonical equilibrium state. We obtain explicitly the minimal possible temperature $T_{\rm min}>0$ reachable for the two-level system. The minimization goes over all unitary dynamic processes operating on the system and reservoir, and over the reservoir energy spectrum. The minimal work needed to reach $T_{\rm min}$ grows as $1/T_{\rm min}$. This work cost can be significantly reduced, though, if one is satisfied by temperatures slightly above $T_{\rm min}$. Our results on $T_{\rm min}>0$ prove unattainability of the absolute zero temperature without ambiguities that surround its derivation from the entropic version of the third law. The unattainability can be recovered, albeit via a different mechanism, for cooling by a reservoir with an initially microcanonic state. We also study cooling via a reservoir consisting of $N\gg 1$ identical spins. Here we show that $T_{\rm min}\propto\frac{1}{N}$ and find the maximal cooling compatible with the minimal work determined by the free energy. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.1088;The second law, maximum entropy production and Liouville's theorem; Roderick C Dewar,  Amos Maritan;  In 1965 Jaynes provided an intuitively simple proof of the 2nd law of thermodynamics as a general requirement for any macroscopic transition to be experimentally reproducible. His proof was based on Boltzmann's formula S = klnW and the dynamical invariance of the phase volume W for isolated systems (Liouville's theorem). Here Jaynes' proof is extended to show that Liouville's theorem also implies maximum entropy production (MaxEP) for the stationary states of open, non-equilibrium systems. According to this proof, MaxEP stationary states are selected because they can exist within a greater number of environments than any other stationary states. Liouville's theorem applied to isolated systems also gives an intuitive derivation of the fluctuation theorem in a form consistent with an earlier conjecture by Jaynes on the probability of violations of the 2nd law. The present proof of MaxEP, while largely heuristic, suggests an approach to establishing a more fundamental basis for MaxEP using Jaynes' maximum entropy formulation of statistical mechanics. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.1108;A scale-invariant probabilistic model based on Leibniz-like pyramids; Antonio RodrÃ­guez,  Constantino Tsallis;"  We introduce a family of probabilistic {\it scale-invariant} Leibniz-like pyramids and $(d+1)$-dimensional hyperpyramids ($d=1,2,3,...$), characterized by a parameter $\nu>0$, whose value determines the degree of correlation between $N$ $(d+1)$-valued random variables. There are $(d+1)^N$ different events, and the limit $\nu\to\infty$ corresponds to independent random variables, in which case each event has a probability $1/(d+1)^N$ to occur. The sums of these $N$ $\,(d+1)$-valued random variables correspond to a $d-$dimensional probabilistic model, and generalizes a recently proposed one-dimensional ($d=1$) model having $q-$Gaussians (with $q=(\nu-2)/(\nu-1)$ for $\nu \in [1,\infty)$) as $N\to\infty$ limit probability distributions for the sum of the $N$ binary variables [A. Rodr\'{\i}guez {\em et al}, J. Stat. Mech. (2008) P09006; R. Hanel {\em et al}, Eur. Phys. J. B {\bf 72}, 263 (2009)]. In the $\nu\to\infty$ limit the $d-$dimensional multinomial distribution is recovered for the sums, which approach a $d-$dimensional Gaussian distribution for $N\to\infty$. For any $\nu$, the conditional distributions of the $d-$dimensional model are shown to yield the corresponding joint distribution of the $(d-1)$-dimensional model with the same $\nu$. For the $d=2$ case, we study the joint probability distribution, and identify two classes of marginal distributions, one of them being asymmetric and scale-invariant, while the other one is symmetric and only asymptotically scale-invariant. The present probabilistic model is proposed as a testing ground for a deeper understanding of the necessary and sufficient conditions for having $q$-Gaussian attractors in the $N\to\infty$ limit, the ultimate goal being a neat mathematical view of the causes clarifying the ubiquitous emergence of $q$-statistics verified in many natural, artificial and social systems.

Neighboring atoms are connected by bonds. We set the energy of a bond to be given by the Lennard-Jones potential. If the energy is larger than a threshold the bond is more likely to fail, while if the energy is lower than the threshold the bond is more likely to be alive. In two dimensions we compute the equation of state: stress as function of inter-atomic distance and temperature by using renormalization group and Monte Carlo simulations. The phase diagram, the equation of state, the isothermal modulus and the thermal expansion are determined. When the Potts heat capacity is divergent the continuous transition is replaced by a weak first-order transition through the van der Waals loop mechanism. When the Potts transition is first order the stress exhibits a large discontinuity as function of the inter-atomic distance. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

It is given rigorously by a Toeplitz determinant. The large-distance behaviour of this correlation function is obtained by analytic methods. For shorter distances we evaluate the Toeplitz determinant numerically. The correlation function is found to vanish exactly on a line J_d(T) in the T-J (temperature vs. coupling constant) phase diagram. This disorder line divides the phase diagram into two regions. For J less than J_d(T) the correlations display the features of an unfrustrated two-dimensional Ising magnet, whereas for J greater than J_d(T) the correlations between the middle spins are seen to be strongly influenced by the short-range antiferromagnetic order that prevails among the spins of the adjacent lattice axes. While for J less than J_d(T) there is a region with ferrimagnetic long-range order, the model remains disordered for J greater than J_d(T) down to T=0. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

Analytical expressions are obtained through fluctuating hydrodynamics and are successfully compared with numerical simulations up to a volume fraction $\sim 50%$. Hydrodynamic noise is the sum of external noise due to the bath and internal one due to collisions. Only the latter is assumed to satisfy the fluctuation-dissipation relation with the average granular temperature. Static velocity structure factors $S_\perp(k)$ and $S_\parallel(k)$ display a general non-constant behavior with two plateaux at large and small $k$, representing the granular temperature $T_g$ and the bath temperature $T_b>T_g$ respectively. From this behavior, two different velocity correlation lengths are measured, both increasing as the packing fraction is raised. This growth of spatial order is in agreement with the behaviour of dynamical structure factors, the decay of which becomes slower and slower at increasing density. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)"

A straightforward implementation of the HRT to the quenched-annealed mixture is shown to lead to unsatisfactory results, while indicating that the critical behavior of the system is in the same universality class as that of the random-field Ising model.

In addition to the macroscopic density and velocity field we consider explicitly the dynamics of an effective temperature of the agent system, representing a measure of velocity fluctuations around the mean velocity. We show that the temperature decreases strongly with increasing level of collective motion despite constant fluctuations on individual level, which suggests that extreme caution should be taken in deducing individual behavior, such as, state-dependent individual fluctuations from mean-field measurements [Yates {\em et al.}, PNAS, 106 (14), 2009]. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Other Quantitative Biology (q-bio.OT)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.1637;A numerical method for determining the interface free energy; A. Hietanen,  B. Lucini;  We propose a general method (based on the Wang-Landau algorithm) to compute numerically free energies that are obtained from the logarithm of the ratio of suitable partition functions. As an application, we determine with high accuracy the order-order interface tension of the four-state Potts model in three dimensions on cubic lattices of linear extension up to L=56. The infinite volume interface tension is then extracted at each beta from a fit of the finite volume interface tension to a known universal behavior. A comparison of the order-order and order-disorder interface tension at the critical value of beta provides a clear numerical evidence of perfect wetting. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat)"

It originates from Baxter's corner transfer matrix equations and method, and was developed by Nishino and Okunishi in 1996. In this paper, we review and adapt this method, previously used for numerical calculations, to derive series expansions. We use this to calculate 92 terms of the partition function of the hard squares model. We also examine the claim that the method is subexponential in the number of generated terms and briefly analyse the resulting series. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Combinatorics (math.CO)"

Benczik,  JÃ¼rgen Vollmer;  Demixing of binary fluids subjected to slow temperature ramps shows repeated waves of nucleation which arise as a consequence of the competition between generation of supersaturation by the temperature ramp and relaxation of supersaturation by diffusive transport and flow. Here, we use an advection-reaction-diffusion model to study the oscillations in the weak- and strong-diffusion regime. There is a sharp transition between the two regimes, which can only be understood based on the probability distribution function of the composition rather than in terms of the average composition. We argue that this transition might be responsible for some yet unclear features of experiments, like the appearance of secondary oscillations and bimodal droplet size distributions. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft); Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics (physics.ao-ph)"

Unusual nonlinear profiles of temperature and velocities are observed in the system. In particular, the temperature is maximal in the center, which is an indication of the nonlocal behavior of the system. In spite of that, local equilibrium holds for long enough chains. Our numerical results also show that, when the mechanical forcing is strong enough, the energy current can be increased by an inverse temperature gradient. This counterintuitive result again reveals the complexity of nonequilibrium states. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

Initially, the problem of fingered growth, where growth takes place only at the tips of slit-like fingers, is revisited and a class of exact exact solutions of the corresponding Loewner equation is presented for the case of stationary driving functions. A model for interface growth is then formulated in terms of a generalized tripolar Loewner equation and several examples are presented, including interfaces with multiple tips as well as multiple growing interfaces. The model exhibits interesting dynamical features, such as tip and finger competition. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS)"

Buldyrev;  We investigate using molecular dynamics the effect of the structure of nanoconfinement for liquids with water-like anomalies and liquid-liquid phase transition (LLPT). We find that if the confinement is in an ordered matrix of nanoparticles (NPs) the anomalies are preserved, although the LLPT shifts to lower temperatures, higher pressures and higher densities with respect to bulk. On the contrary, if the NPs matrix is disordered, we find a drastically different phase diagram: the LLPT occurs only in a reduced interval of densities and the anomalies are washed out. To understand this effect we calculate the changes in the system at the microscopic level. In all the different confinements considered here we observe a dramatic increase of density of liquid near the confining NPs. In the disordered case the confinement induces larger heterogeneity in the local density, responsible for the weakening of the LLPT and the disappearance of anomalies. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

High temperature particle evaporation is a part of substrate preparation processes before epitaxy. The ideal surface ordering expected after such heating is a pattern of parallel, equally distanced steps. It appears however, that different types of step structures emerge at high temperatures. We show how the creation of characteristic patterns depends on the temperature and the annealing time. The first pattern is created for a very short evaporation time and consists of rough steps. The second pattern built by curly steps is characteristic for longer evaporation times and lower temperatures. The third pattern, in which steps merge together creating bunches of steps happens for the long enough time. At higher temperatures, bunches of steps bend into the wavy-like structures. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)"

We demonstrate that this conjecture fails for a generic class of maps of the Pomeau-Manneville type. We show further that, typically, the decay properties of such tail probabilities do not provide significant information on key aspects of weakly chaotic dynamics such as ergodicity and instability regimes.

Specifically, one couples a reservoir to the physical magnitude of interest, and studies the statistical ensemble where the total magnitude (system+reservoir) is conserved. The reservoir is actually integrated out, which leaves us with a fluctuation-dissipation formalism that allows us to recover the appropriate Helmholtz effective potential with great accuracy. These methods are demonstrating a remarkable flexibility. In fact, we illustrate two very different applications: hard spheres crystallization and the phase transition of the diluted antiferromagnet in a field (the physical realization of the random field Ising model). The tethered approach holds the promise to transform cartoon drawings of corrugated free-energy landscapes into real computations. Besides, it reduces the algorithmic dynamic slowing-down, probably because the conservation law holds non-locally. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.2125;On Modeling of Statistical Properties of Classical 3D Spin Glasses; A. S. Gevorkyan,  H. G. Abajyan,  E. A. Ayryan;  We study statistical properties of 3D classical spin glass layer of certain width and infinite length. The 3D spin glass is represented as an ensemble of disordered 1D spatial spin-chains (SSC) where interactions are random between spin-chains (nonideal ensemble of 1D SSCs). It is proved that at the limit of Birkhoff's ergodic hypothesis performance 3D spin glasses can be generated by Hamiltonian of disordered 1D SSC with random environment. Disordered 1D SSC is defined on a regular lattice where one randomly oriented spin is put on each node of lattice. Also it is supposed that each spin randomly interacts with six nearest-neighboring spins (two spins on lattice and four in the environment). The recurrent transcendental equations are obtained on the nodes of spin-chain lattice. These equations combined with the Silvester conditions allow step by step construct spin-chain in the ground state of energy where all spins are in minimal energy of classical Hamiltonian. On the basis of these equations an original high-performance parallel algorithm is developed for 3D spin glasses simulation. Distributions of different parameters of unperturbed spin glass are calculated. In particular, it is analytically proved and by numerical calculations shown that the distribution of spin-spin interaction constant in Heisenberg nearest-neighboring Hamiltonian model as opposed to widely used Gauss-Edwards- Anderson distribution satisfies L\'evy alpha-stable distribution law which does not have variance. A new formula is proposed for construction of partition function in kind of one-dimensional integral on energy distribution of 1D SSCs ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.2168;Information Symmetries in Irreversible Processes; Christopher J. Ellison,  John R. Mahoney,  Ryan G. James,  James P. Crutchfield,  Joerg Reichardt;  We study dynamical reversibility in stationary stochastic processes from an information theoretic perspective. Extending earlier work on the reversibility of Markov chains, we focus on finitary processes with arbitrarily long conditional correlations. In particular, we examine stationary processes represented or generated by edge-emitting, finite-state hidden Markov models. Surprisingly, we find pervasive temporal asymmetries in the statistics of such stationary processes with the consequence that the computational resources necessary to generate a process in the forward and reverse temporal directions are generally not the same. In fact, an exhaustive survey indicates that most stationary processes are irreversible. We study the ensuing relations between model topology in different representations, the process's statistical properties, and its reversibility in detail. A process's temporal asymmetry is efficiently captured using two canonical unifilar representations of the generating model, the forward-time and reverse-time epsilon-machines. We analyze example irreversible processes whose epsilon-machine presentations change size under time reversal, including one which has a finite number of recurrent causal states in one direction, but an infinite number in the opposite. From the forward-time and reverse-time epsilon-machines, we are able to construct a symmetrized, but nonunifilar, generator of a process---the bidirectional machine. Using the bidirectional machine, we show how to directly calculate a process's fundamental information properties, many of which are otherwise only poorly approximated via process samples. The tools we introduce and the insights we offer provide a better understanding of the many facets of reversibility and irreversibility in stochastic processes. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Information Theory (cs.IT); Statistics Theory (math.ST); Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD)"

We analyze the symmetries of the KPZ problem and derive an approximation scheme that satisfies the linearly realized ones. We implement this scheme at the minimal order in the response field, and show that it yields a complete, qualitatively correct phase diagram in all dimensions, with reasonable values for the critical exponents in physical dimensions. We also compute in one dimension the full (momentum and frequency dependent) correlation function, and the associated universal scaling functions. We find an excellent quantitative agreement with the exact results from Praehofer and Spohn (J. Stat. Phys. 115 (2004)). We emphasize that all these results, which can be systematically improved, are obtained with sole input the bare action and its symmetries, without further assumptions on the existence of scaling or on the form of the scaling function. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)"

When the difference in the pendulum lengths is not too large, it is shown that the system settles down into the dynamic state of the antiphase synchronization with the phase difference $\pi$. We observe that there is a bistable region where either the antiphase synchronized state or the desynchronized state can be stabilized.

The ground-state of the system is an adsorptive state. Part of the finite-size scaling spectrum of the evolution Hamiltonian stays unchanged but some levels go exponentially to zero for large lattice sizes becoming degenerate with the ground-state. As a consequence one observes the appearance of quasistationary states which have a relaxation time which grows exponentially with the size of the system. Several initial conditions have singled out a quasistationary state which has in the finite-size scaling limit the same properties as the stationary state of the conformal invariant model. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat)"

Exploiting the small correlation lengths in frustrated Ising systems, we develop a method for obtaining a first approximation to the energetic properties of frustrated two-dimensional Ising systems using small networks of less than 30 spins. These small networks allow much faster numerical simulations, and more importantly, analytical calculation of the properties from the partition function is possible. We choose Ising systems on the triangular lattice, the Kagome lattice, and the triangular Kagome lattice as prototype systems and find small systems that can serve as good approximations to these prototype systems. We also develop criteria for constructing small networks to approximate general two-dimensional frustrated Ising systems. This method of using small networks provides a novel and efficient way to obtain a first approximation to the properties of frustrated spin systems. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Disordered Systems and Neural Networks (cond-mat.dis-nn)"

We introduce {\it tomographic} entropic sampling, a scheme which uses multiple studies, starting from different regions of configuration space, to yield precise estimates of the number of configurations over the {\it full range} of energies, {\it without} dividing the latter into subsets or windows. Applied to the Ising model on the square lattice, the method yields the critical temperature to an accuracy of about 0.01%, and critical exponents to 1% or better. Predictions for systems sizes L=10 - 160, for the temperature of the specific heat maximum, and of the specific heat at the critical temperature, are in very close agreement with exact results. For the Ising model on the simple cubic lattice the critical temperature is given to within 0.003% of the best available estimate; the exponent ratios $\beta/\nu$ and $\gamma/\nu$ are given to within about 0.4% and 1%, respectively, of the literature values. In both two and three dimensions, results for the {\it antiferromagnetic} critical point are fully consistent with those of the ferromagnetic transition. Application to the lattice gas with nearest-neighbor exclusion on the square lattice again yields the critical chemical potential and exponent ratios $\beta/\nu$ and $\gamma/\nu$ to good precision.

Sivak,  John D. Chodera,  Gavin E. Crooks;  Common algorithms for computationally simulating Langevin dynamics must discretize the stochastic differential equations of motion. These resulting finite time step integrators necessarily have several practical issues in common: Microscopic reversibility is violated, the sampled stationary distribution differs from the desired equilibrium distribution, and the work accumulated in nonequilibrium simulations is not directly usable in estimators based on nonequilibrium work theorems. Here, we show that even with a time-independent Hamiltonian, finite time step Langevin integrators can be thought of as a driven, nonequilibrium physical process. Once an appropriate work-like quantity is defined -- here called the shadow work -- recently developed nonequilibrium fluctuation theorems can be used to measure or correct for the errors introduced by the use of finite time steps. In particular, we demonstrate that amending estimators based on nonequilibrium work theorems to include this shadow work removes the time step dependent error from estimates of free energies. We also quantify, for the first time, the magnitude of deviations between the sampled stationary distribution and the desired equilibrium distribution for equilibrium Langevin simulations of solvated systems of varying size. While these deviations can be large, they can be eliminated altogether by Metropolization or greatly diminished by small reductions in the time step. Through this connection with driven processes, further developments in nonequilibrium fluctuation theorems can provide additional analytical tools for dealing with errors in finite time step integrators. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)"

In some cases, depending on the parameters of the model, the preference toward successfully communicating agents is basically negligible and the model behaves similarly to the naming game on a complete graph. In particular, it quickly reaches a single-language state, albeit some details of the dynamics are different from the complete-graph version. In some other cases, the preference toward successfully communicating agents becomes much more relevant and the model gets trapped in a multi-language regime. In this case gradual coarsening and extinction of languages lead to the emergence of a dominant language, albeit with some other languages still being present.

Glotzer,  David Chandler;  For several atomistic models of glass formers, at conditions below their glassy dynamics onset temperatures, ${T_\mathrm{o}}$, we use importance sampling of trajectory space to study the structure, statistics and dynamics of excitations responsible for structural relaxation. Excitations are detected in terms of persistent particle displacements of length $a$. At supercooled conditions, for $a$ of the order of or smaller than a particle diameter, we find that excitations are associated with correlated particle motions that are sparse and localized, occupying a volume with an average radius that is temperature independent and no larger than a few particle diameters. We show that the statistics and dynamics of these excitations are facilitated and hierarchical. Excitation energy scales grow logarithmically with $a$. Excitations at one point in space facilitate the birth and death of excitations at neighboring locations, and space-time excitation structures are microcosms of heterogeneous dynamics at larger scales. This nature of dynamics becomes increasingly dominant as temperature $T$ is lowered. We show that slowing of dynamics upon decreasing temperature below $T_\mathrm{o}$ is the result of a decreasing concentration of excitations and concomitant growing hierarchical length scales, and further that the structural relaxation time $\tau$ follows the parabolic law, $\log(\tau / \tau_\mathrm{o}) = J^2(1/T - 1/T_\mathrm{o})^2$, for $T<T_\mathrm{o}$, where $J$, $\tau_\mathrm{o}$ and $T_\mathrm{o}$ can be predicted quantitatively from dynamics at short time scales. Particle motion is facilitated and directional, and we show this becomes more apparent with decreasing $T$. We show that stringlike motion is a natural consequence of facilitated, hierarchical dynamics. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci); Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.3727;Frozen shuffle update for an asymmetric exclusion process with open  boundary conditions; C. Appert-Rolland,  J. Cividini,  H.J. Hilhorst;  We introduce a new update algorithm for exclusion processes, more suitable for the modeling of pedestrian traffic. Pedestrians are modeled as hard-core particles hopping on a discrete lattice, and are updated in a fixed order, determined by a phase attached to each pedestrian. While the case of periodic boundary conditions was studied in a companion paper, we consider here the case of open boundary conditions. The full phase diagram is predicted analytically and exhibits a transition between a free flow phase and a jammed phase. The density profile is predicted in the frame of a domain wall theory, and compared to Monte Carlo simulations, in particular in the vicinity of the transition. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.3922;Fractal structure of a three dimensional Brownian motion on an  attractive plane; Abbas Ali Saberi;  Consider a Brownian particle in three dimensions which is attracted by a plane with a strength proportional to some dimensionless parameter $\alpha$. We investigate the fractal spatial structure of the visited lattice sites in a cubic lattice by the particle around and on the attractive plane. We compute the fractal dimensions of the set of visited sites both in three dimensions and on the attractive plane, as a function of the strength of attraction $\alpha$. We also investigate the scaling properties of the size distribution of the clusters of nearest-neighbor visited sites on the attractive plane, and compute the corresponding scaling exponent $\tau$ as a function of $\alpha$. The fractal dimension of the curves surrounding the clusters is also computed for different values of $\alpha$, which, in the limit $\alpha\rightarrow\infty$, tends to that of the outer perimeter of planar Brownian motion i.e., the self-avoiding random walk (SAW). We find that all measured exponents depend significantly on the strength of attraction. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Probability (math.PR)"

Ellenbroek,  Xiaoming Mao;  The square lattice with central forces between nearest neighbors is isostatic with a subextensive number of floppy modes. It can be made rigid by the random addition of next-nearest neighbor bonds. This constitutes a rigidity percolation transition which we study analytically by mapping it to a connectivity problem of two-colored random graphs. We derive an exact recurrence equation for the probability of having a rigid percolating cluster and solve it in the infinite volume limit. From this solution we obtain the rigidity threshold as a function of system size, and find that, in the thermodynamic limit, there is a mixed first-order-second-order rigidity percolation transition at the isostatic point. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

We show that when working with a finite number of particles N, the Renyi entanglement entropies grow as log N, with a prefactor that is given by the central charge. We apply this novel technique to the ground state and to excited states of periodic systems. We also consider systems with boundaries. We derive universal formulas for the leading behavior and for subleading corrections to the scaling. The universality of the results allows us to make predictions for the finite-size scaling forms of the corrections to the scaling. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.4124;Active Matter on Asymmetric Substrates; C.J. Olson Reichhardt,  J. Drocco,  T. Mai,  M.B. Wan,  C. Reichhardt;"  For collections of particles in a thermal bath interacting with an asymmetric substrate, it is possible for a ratchet effect to occur where the particles undergo a net dc motion in response to an ac forcing. Ratchet effects have been demonstrated in a variety of systems including colloids as well as magnetic vortices in type-II superconductors. Here we examine the case of active matter or self-driven particles interacting with asymmetric substrates. Active matter systems include self-motile colloidal particles undergoing catalysis, swimming bacteria, artificial swimmers, crawling cells, and motor proteins. We show that a ratchet effect can arise in this type of system even in the absence of ac forcing. The directed motion occurs for certain particle-substrate interaction rules and its magnitude depends on the amount of time the particles spend swimming in one direction before turning and swimming in a new direction. For strictly Brownian particles there is no ratchet effect. If the particles reflect off the barriers or scatter from the barriers according to Snell's law there is no ratchet effect; however, if the particles can align with the barriers or move along the barriers, directed motion arises. We also find that under certain motion rules, particles accumulate along the walls of the container in agreement with experiment. We also examine pattern formation for synchronized particle motion. We discuss possible applications of this system for self-assembly, extracting work, and sorting as well as future directions such as considering collective interactions and flocking models.

We have also investigated the effect of the random crystal field distribution characterized by two crystal field parameters $D/J$ and $\triangle/J$ on the phase diagrams of the system. The system exhibits clear distinctions in qualitative manner with coordination number $q$ for random crystal fields with $\triangle/J,D/J\neq0$.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.4214;Competitive Brownian and Levy walkers; E. Heinsalu,  E. Hernandez-Garcia,  C. Lopez (IFISC, CSIC-UIB);  Population dynamics of individuals undergoing birth and death and diffusing by short or long ranged twodimensional spatial excursions (Gaussian jumps or L\'{e}vy flights) is studied. Competitive interactions are considered in a global case, in which birth and death rates are influenced by all individuals in the system, and in a nonlocal but finite-range case in which interaction affects individuals in a neighborhood (we also address the noninteracting case). In the global case one single or few-cluster configurations are achieved with the spatial distribution of the bugs tied to the type of diffusion. In the L\'{e}vy case long tails appear for some properties characterizing the shape and dynamics of clusters. Under non-local finite-range interactions periodic patterns appear with periodicity set by the interaction range. This length acts as a cut-off limiting the influence of the long L\'{e}vy jumps, so that spatial configurations under the two types of diffusion become more similar. By dividing initially everyone into different families and following their descent it is possible to show that mixing of families and their competition is greatly influenced by the spatial dynamics. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph); Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)"

Majumdar;  We consider the mean time to absorption by an absorbing target of a diffusive particle with the addition of a process whereby the particle is reset to its initial position with rate $r$. We consider several generalisations of the model of M. R. Evans and S. N. Majumdar (2011), Diffusion with stochastic resetting, Phys. Rev.

As an example of (i) we show that the introduction of a non-resetting window around the initial position can reduce the mean time to absorption provided that the initial position is sufficiently far from the target. We address the problem of optimal resetting, that is, minimising the mean time to absorption for a given target distribution. For an exponentially decaying target distribution centred at the origin we show that a transition in the optimal resetting distribution occurs as the target distribution narrows. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)"

Trizac;  We study the effective interactions between a test charge Q and a one-component plasma, i.e. a complex made up of mobile point particles with charge q, and a uniform oppositely charged background. The background has the form of a flat disk, in which the mobile charges can move. The test particle is approached perpendicularly to the disk, along its axis of symmetry. All particles interact by a logarithmic potential. The long and short distance features of the effective potential --the free energy of the system for a given distance between Q and the disk-- are worked out analytically in detail. They crucially depend on the sign of Q/q, and on the global charge borne by the discotic complex, that can vanish. While most results are obtained at the intermediate coupling Gamma = beta q^2 = 2 (beta being the inverse temperature), we have also investigated situations with stronger couplings: Gamma=4 and 6. We have found that at large distances, the sign of the effective force reflects subtle details of the charge distribution on the disk, whereas at short distances, polarization effects invariably lead to effective attractions. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.4615;Dynamically Induced Locking and Unlocking Transitions in Driven Layered  Systems with Quenched Disorder; C. Reichhardt,  C.J. Olson Reichhardt;"  Using numerical simulations, we examine a simple model of two or more coupled one-dimensional channels of driven particles with repulsive interactions in the presence of quenched disorder. We find that this model exhibits a remarkably rich variety of dynamical behavior as a function of the strength of the quenched disorder, coupling between channels, and external drive. For weaker disorder, the channels depin in a single step. For two channels we find dynamically induced decoupling transitions that result in coexisting pinned and moving phases as well as moving decoupled phases where particles in both channels move at different average velocities and slide past one another. Decoupling can also be induced by changing the relative strength of the disorder in neighboring channels. At higher drives, we observe a dynamical recoupling or locking transition into a state with no relative motion between the channels.This recoupling produces unusual velocity-force signatures, including negative differential conductivity. The depinning threshold shows distinct changes near the decoupling and coupling transitions and exhibits a peak effect phenomenon of the type that has been associated with transitions from elastic to plastic flow in other systems. We map several dynamic phase diagrams showing the coupling-decoupling transitions and the regions in which hysteresis occurs. We also examine the coexistence regime for channels with unequal amounts of quenched disorder. For multiple channels, multiple coupling and decoupling transitions can occur; however, many of the general features found for the two channel system are still present. Our results should be relevant to depinning in layered geometries in systems such as vortices in layered or nanostructured superconductors and Wigner or colloidal particles confined in nano-channels; they are also relevant to the general understating of plastic flow.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.4662;Random walks in small-world exponential treelike networks; Zhongzhi Zhang,  Xintong Li,  Yuan Lin,  Guanrong Chen;  In this paper, we investigate random walks in a family of small-world trees having an exponential degree distribution. First, we address a trapping problem, that is, a particular case of random walks with an immobile trap located at the initial node. We obtain the exact mean trapping time defined as the average of first-passage time (FPT) from all nodes to the trap, which scales linearly with the network order $N$ in large networks. Then, we determine analytically the mean sending time, which is the mean of the FPTs from the initial node to all other nodes, and show that it grows with $N$ in the order of $N \ln N$. After that, we compute the precise global mean first-passage time among all pairs of nodes and find that it also varies in the order of $N \ln N$ in the large limit of $N$. After obtaining the relevant quantities, we compare them with each other and related our results to the efficiency for information transmission by regarding the walker as an information messenger. Finally, we compare our results with those previously reported for other trees with different structural properties (e.g., degree distribution), such as the standard fractal trees and the scale-free small-world trees, and show that the shortest path between a pair of nodes in a tree is responsible for the scaling of FPT between the two nodes. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.4963;Stochastic theory of large-scale enzyme-reaction networks: Finite copy  number corrections to rate equation models; Philipp Thomas,  Arthur V. Straube,  Ramon Grima;  Chemical reactions inside cells occur in compartment volumes in the range of atto- to femtolitres. Physiological concentrations realized in such small volumes imply low copy numbers of interacting molecules with the consequence of considerable fluctuations in the concentrations. In contrast, rate equation models are based on the implicit assumption of infinitely large numbers of interacting molecules, or equivalently, that reactions occur in infinite volumes at constant macroscopic concentrations. In this article we compute the finite-volume corrections (or equivalently the finite copy number corrections) to the solutions of the rate equations for chemical reaction networks composed of arbitrarily large numbers of enzyme-catalyzed reactions which are confined inside a small sub-cellular compartment. This is achieved by applying a mesoscopic version of the quasi-steady state assumption to the exact Fokker-Planck equation associated with the Poisson Representation of the chemical master equation. The procedure yields impressively simple and compact expressions for the finite-volume corrections. We prove that the predictions of the rate equations will always underestimate the actual steady-state substrate concentrations for an enzyme-reaction network confined in a small volume. In particular we show that the finite-volume corrections increase with decreasing sub-cellular volume, decreasing Michaelis-Menten constants and increasing enzyme saturation. The magnitude of the corrections depends sensitively on the topology of the network. The predictions of the theory are shown to be in excellent agreement with stochastic simulations for two types of networks typically associated with protein methylation and metabolism. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph); Molecular Networks (q-bio.MN)"

In addition we argue that the number of floppy modes $F$ plays the role of a free energy and hence find the exponent $\alpha$ and establish hyperscaling. The exact analytical procedures demonstrated on the chosen example readily generalize to wider classes of hierarchical lattice. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)"

Miller III;"  The use of ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) for the direct simulation of electron transfer (ET) reaction dynamics is analyzed in the context of Marcus theory, semiclassical instanton theory, and exact quantum dynamics approaches. For both fully atomistic and system-bath representations of condensed-phase ET, we demonstrate that RPMD accurately predicts both ET reaction rates and mechanisms throughout the normal and activationless regimes of the thermodynamic driving force. Analysis of the ensemble of reactive RPMD trajectories reveals the solvent reorganization mechanism for ET that is anticipated in the Marcus rate theory, and the accuracy of the RPMD rate calculation is understood in terms of its exact description of statistical fluctuations and its formal connection to semiclassical instanton theory for deep-tunneling processes. In the inverted regime of the thermodynamic driving force, neither RPMD nor a related formulation of semiclassical instanton theory capture the characteristic turnover in the reaction rate; comparison with exact quantum dynamics simulations reveals that these methods provide inadequate quantization of the real-time electronic-state dynamics in the inverted regime.

Each lane is modeled by a TASEP (Totally Asymmetric Exclusion Process). The particles enter and leave lane $\sigma$ (where $\sigma=1,2$) with probabilities $\alpha_\sigma$ and $\beta_\sigma$, respectively. We employ the `frozen shuffle' update introduced in earlier work [C. Appert-Rolland et al, J. Stat. Mech. (2011) P07009], in which the particle positions are updated in a fixed random order. We find analytically that each lane may be in a `free flow' or in a `jammed' state. Hence the phase diagram in the domain $0\leq\alpha_1,\alpha_2\leq 1$ consists of four regions with boundaries depending on $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$. The regions meet in a single point on the diagonal of the domain.

We demonstrate, in a general setting, that a superstatistics arises when the system relaxes to a (stationary) quasi-equilibrium state instead, where only the \textit{mean} current vanishes because of fluctuations. In particular, we show that a current with Gaussian white noise takes the system to a unique class of quasi-equilibrium states, where the superstatistics coincides with Tsallis escort $q$-distributions. Considering the fully developed turbulence as an example of such quasi-equilibrium states, we analytically deduce the power-law spectrum of the velocity structure functions, yielding a correction to the log-normal model which removes its shortcomings with regard to the decreasing higher order moments and the Novikov inequality, and obtain exponents that agree well with the experimental data. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)"

As an application we present a variational MPS study of $su(2)$ invariant quantum spin systems. For efficient computations we make systematic use of the su(2) symmetry at all steps of the calculations: (i) the matrix space is set up as a direct sum of irreducible representations, (ii) the local matrices with state-valued entries are set up as superposition of su(2) singlet operators, (iii) products of operators are evaluated algebraically by making use of identities for $3j$ and $6j$ symbols. The remaining numerical computations like the diagonalization of the associated transfer matrix and the minimization of the energy expectation value are done in spaces free of symmetry degeneracies. The energy expectation value is a strict upper bound of the true ground-state energy and yields definite conclusions about the accuracy of DMRG results reported in the literature. Furthermore, we present explicit results with accuracy better than $10^{-4}$ for nearest- and next-nearest neighbour spin correlators and for general dimer-dimer correlators in the thermodynamical limit of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain with frustration. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

Vaez Allaei;  In this paper, we study many geometrical properties of contour loops to characterize the morphology of synthetic multifractal rough surfaces, which are generated by multiplicative hierarchical cascading processes. To this end, two different classes of multifractal rough surfaces are numerically simulated. As the first group, singular measure multifractal rough surfaces are generated by using the $p$ model. The smoothened multifractal rough surface then is simulated by convolving the first group with a so-called Hurst exponent, $H^*$ . The generalized multifractal dimension of isoheight lines (contours), $D(q)$, correlation exponent of contours, $x_l$, cumulative distributions of areas, $\xi$, and perimeters, $\eta$, are calculated for both synthetic multifractal rough surfaces. Our results show that for both mentioned classes, hyperscaling relations for contour loops are the same as that of monofractal systems. In contrast to singular measure multifractal rough surfaces, $H^*$ plays a leading role in smoothened multifractal rough surfaces. All computed geometrical exponents for the first class depend not only on its Hurst exponent but also on the set of $p$ values. But in spite of multifractal nature of smoothened surfaces (second class), the corresponding geometrical exponents are controlled by $H^*$, the same as what happens for monofractal rough surfaces. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)"

Our SE perpendicular persistence time is evaluated in terms of simple integrals over the equilibrium local density. When properly scaled by the perpendicular diffusion coefficient, it gives a good match with that obtained from Molecular Dynamics.

Both for attractive and repulsive nearest-neighbor interactions among particles and for a wide range of parameter values, we find that, to a good approximation, one could define an intensive thermodynamic variable, like equilibrium chemical potential, which determines the final steady state for two initially separated driven lattice gases brought into contact. However, due to nontrivial contact dynamics, there are also observable deviations from this simple thermodynamic law. To illustrate the role of the contact dynamics, we study a variant of the zero range process and discuss how the deviations could be explained by a modified large deviation principle. We identify an additional contribution to the large deviation function, which we call the excess chemical potential, for the variant of the zero range process as well as the driven lattice gases.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.5440;Cubic and non-cubic multiple-q states in the Heisenberg antiferromagnet  on the pyrochlore lattice; Tsuyoshi Okubo,  Trung Hai Nguyen,  Hikaru Kawamura;  The ordering of the classical Heisenberg model on the pyrochlore lattice with the antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbor interaction J1 and the ferromagnetic next-nearest-neighbour interaction J2 is investigated by means of a mean-field analysis and a Monte Carlo simulation. For a moderate J2/J1-value, the model exhibits a first-order transition into an incommensurate multiple-q ordered state where multiple Bragg peaks coexist in the spin structure factor. We show that there are two types of metastable multiple-q states, a cubic symmetric sextuple-q state and a non-cubic symmetric quadruple-q state. Based on a Monte Carlo simulation, we find that the cubic sextuple-q state appears just below the first-order transition temperature, while another transition from the cubic sextuple-q state to the non-cubic quadruple-q state occurs at a lower temperature. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.5444;Phase segregation and transport in a two species multi-lane system; Sudipto Muhuri,  Ignacio Pagonabarraga;"  We present a two channel driven lattice gas model with oppositely directed species moving on two parallel lanes with lane switching processes. We study correlated lane switching mechanism for particles so that switching may occur with finite probability only when oppositely directed species meet on the same channel. The system is analyzed for closed ring with conserved total particle number. For asymmetric particle exchange between the lanes, the system exhibits unique polarization phenomenon with segregation of oppositely directed species between the two lanes. The polarization phenomenon can be understood as a consequence of existence of an absorbing steady state. For symmetric exchange rate of particles between the lanes, the system remains unpolarized, with equal particle density on both the lanes in the thermodynamic limit of large system size. We study the system using a combination of a Mean Field(MF) analysis and Monte Carlo simulations. The nature of phase segregation that we see for this system, is distinct from driven particle systems which are in contact with particle reservoir. The features observed for this minimal model will have ramifications for biofilament based intracellular transport, wherein cellular cargo, e.g; organelles and vesicles are transported by oppositely directed particles on multiple filament tracks.

In the weak asymmetry limit, where the asymmetry vanishes with the length of the system, the model exhibits a phase transition between a homogenous state and a phase separated state. We derive the exact solution for the density profiles of the three species in the hydrodynamic limit for arbitrary average densities. The solution yields the complete phase diagram of the model and allows the study of the nature of the first order phase transition found for average densities that deviate significantly from the equal densities point. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1108.0275;Particle escapes in an open quantum network via multiple leads; Tooru Taniguchi,  Shin-ichi Sawada;"  Quantum escapes of a particle from an end of a one-dimensional finite region to $N$ number of semi-infinite leads are discussed by a scattering theoretical approach. Depending on a potential barrier amplitude at the junction, the probability $P(t)$ for a particle to remain in the finite region at time $t$ shows two different decay behaviors after a long time; one is proportional to $N^{2}/t^{3}$ and another is proportional to $1/(N^{2}t)$. In addition, the velocity $V(t)$ for a particle to leave from the finite region, defined from a probability current of the particle position, decays in power $\sim 1/t$ asymptotically in time, independently of the number $N$ of leads and the initial wave function, etc. For a finite time, the probability $P(t)$ decays exponentially in time with a smaller decay rate for more number $N$ of leads, and the velocity $V(t)$ shows a time-oscillation whose amplitude is larger for more number $N$ of leads. Particle escapes from the both ends of a finite region to multiple leads are also discussed by using a different boundary condition. ";Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

By combining the replica-exchange algorithm with cluster updates and an adaptive routine to find the range of interest, we introduce a new flexible and powerful method for systematic investigations of critical phenomena. As a result, we gain two further orders of magnitude in the performance for 2D and 3D Ising models in comparison with the recently proposed Wang-Landau recursion for cluster algorithms based on the multibondic algorithm, which is already a great improvement over the standard multicanonical variant. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)"

In order to assess their relevance for the critical behavior, we determine the renormalization-group dimensions of the anisotropic perturbations associated with the first few spin values of the representations of the O(N) group, because the lowest spin values give rise to the most important effects. In particular, we determine them up to spin 4 for N=2,3,4, by finite-size analyses of Monte Carlo simulations of lattice O(N) models, achieving a significant improvement of their accuracy. These results are relevant for several physical systems, such as density-wave systems, magnets with cubic symmetry, and multicritical phenomena arising from the competition of different order parameters. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

Surface processes are thermally activated, with (quenched) binding energies drawn from a \emph{continuous} distribution. We show that sites in this model provide either coverage or mobility, depending on their energy. We use this to analytically map the system to an effective \emph{binary} model in a temperature-dependent way. The behavior of the effective model is well-understood and accurately describes key quantities of the system: Compared with discrete distributions, the temperature window of efficient reaction is broadened, and the efficiency decays more slowly at its ends. The mapping also explains in what parameter regimes the system exhibits realization dependence. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

To achieve this, we map the estimator onto the Random Energy Model in a suitable scaling limit parametrized by (log N)/m, where m measures the width of the lower tail of the work distribution, and then compute the finite-N corrections to this limit with different approaches for different regimes of (log N)/m. We show that these expressions describe accurately the bias for a wide class of work distributions, and exploit them to build an improved free-energy estimator from unidirectional work measurements. We apply the method to optical tweezers unfolding/refolding experiments on DNA hairpins of varying loop size and dissipation, displaying both near-Gaussian and non-Gaussian work distributions. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)"

These systems, adequately described by the Vlasov equation, present quasi-stationary states (QSS), i.e. long lasting intermediate stages of the dynamics that occur after a short significant evolution called ""violent relaxation"". The nature of the relaxation, in the absence of collisions, is not yet fully understood. We demonstrate in this article the occurrence of stretching and folding behavior in numerical simulations of the Vlasov equation, providing a plausible relaxation mechanism that brings the system from its initial condition into the QSS regime. Area-preserving discrete-time maps with a mean-field coupling term are found to display a similar behaviour in phase space as the Vlasov system. ";Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1108.0753;Velocity correlations of a discrete-time totally asymmetric  simple-exclusion process in stationary state on a circle; Yasuyuki Yamada,  Makoto Katori;  The discrete-time version of totally asymmetric simple-exclusion process (TASEP) on a finite one-dimensional lattice is studied with the periodic boundary condition. Each particle at a site hops to the next site with probability $0 \leq p \leq 1$, if the next site is empty. This condition can be rephrased by the condition that the number $n$ of vacant sites between the particle and the next particle is positive. Then the average velocity is given by a product of the hopping probability $p$ and the probability that $n \geq 1$. By mapping the TASEP to another driven diffusive system called the zero-range process, it is proved that the distribution function of vacant sites in the stationary state is exactly given by a factorized form. We define $k$-particle velocity correlation function as the expectation value of a product of velocities of $k$ particles in the stationary distribution. It is shown that it does not depend on positions of $k$ particles on a circle but depends only on the number $k$. We give explicit expressions for all velocity correlation functions using the Gauss hypergeometric functions. Covariance of velocities of two particles is studied in detail and we show that velocities become independent asymptotically in the thermodynamic limit. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)"

Particularly, an ideal gas of fermions or bosons with the energy spectrum $\epsilon_p=m^4/p^3$ in 3-dimensional space will have the pressure $P=-E$. Exotic material, associated with the dark energy at $E+P<0$, is also included in analysis. We determine the properties of regular and exotic ideal Fermi gas at zero temperature and derive a low-temperature expansion of its thermodynamical functions at finite temperature. The Fermi level of exotic matter is shifted below the Fermi energy at zero temperature, while the Fermi level of regular matter is always above it. The heat capacity of any fermionic substance is always linear dependent on temperature, but exotic matter has negative entropy and negative heat capacity. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)"

Tseluiko;  We examine the effects of pure additive noise on spatially extended systems with quadratic nonlinearities. We develop a general multiscale theory for such systems and apply it to the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation as a case study. We first focus on a regime close to the instability onset (primary bifurcation), where the system can be described by a single dominant mode. We show analytically that the resulting noise in the equation describing the amplitude of the dominant mode largely depends on the nature of the stochastic forcing. For a highly degenerate noise, in the sense that it is acting on the first stable mode only, the amplitude equation is dominated by a pure multiplicative noise, which in turn induces the dominant mode to undergo several critical state transitions and complex phenomena, including intermittency and stabilisation, as the noise strength is increased. The intermittent behaviour is characterised by a power-law probability density and the corresponding critical exponent is calculated rigorously by making use of the first-passage properties of the amplitude equation. On the other hand, when the noise is acting on the whole subspace of stable modes, the multiplicative noise is corrected by an additive-like term, with the eventual loss of any stabilised state. We also show that the stochastic forcing has no effect on the dominant mode dynamics when it is acting on the second stable mode. Finally, in a regime which is relatively far from the instability onset, so that there are two unstable modes, we observe numerically that when the noise is acting on the first stable mode, both dominant modes show noise-induced complex phenomena similar to the single-mode case. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1108.0915;Rolling motion of a rigid sphere on a structured rubber substrate aided  by a random noise and an external bias; Partho S. Goohpattader,  Srinivas Mettu,  Manoj K. Chaudhury;  We study the rolling motion of a small solid sphere on a surface patterned rubber substrate in an external field with and without a noise. In the absence of the noise, the ball does not move below a threshold force above which it accelerates sub-linearly with the applied field. In the presence of a random noise, the ball exhibits a stochastic rolling with a net drift, the velocity of which increases non-linearly with the strength of the noise (K). From the evolution of the displacement distribution, it is evident that the rolling is controlled by a Coulomb like friction at a very low velocity, a super-linear friction at an intermediate velocity and a linear kinematic friction at a large velocity. This transition from a non-linear to a linear friction control of motion can be discerned from another experiment in which the ball is subjected to a small amplitude periodic asymmetric vibration in conjunction with a random noise. Here, as opposed to that of a fixed external force, the rolling velocity decreases with the increase of the strength of the noise suggesting a progressive fluidization of the interface. Furthermore, the ball exhibits a flow reversal with the increase of the amplitude of the asymmetric vibration, which is indicative of a profile of friction that first descends and then ascends with velocity. An approximate non-linear friction model with the non-linearity decreasing with K is somewhat consistent with the evolution of the displacement fluctuation that also explains the sigmoidal variation of the drift velocity with the strength of the noise. This research sets the stage for studying friction in a new way, in which it is submitted to a noise and then its dynamic response is studied using the tools of statistical mechanics. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)"

We show that the method to derive modified fluctuation-dissipation theorems near non-equilibrium stationary states used by J. Prost et al., PRL 103, 090601 (2009), is generalizable to non-stationary states. This result follows from both standard linear response theory and from a transient fluctuation theorem, analogous to the Hatano-Sasa relation. We show that this modified fluctuation-dissipation theorem can be interpreted at the trajectory level using the notion of stochastic trajectory entropy, in a way which is similar to what has been done recently in the case of MFDT near non-equilibrium steady states (NESS). We illustrate this framework with two solvable examples: the first example corresponds to a brownian particle in an harmonic trap submitted to a quench of temperature and to a time-dependent stiffness. The second example is a classic model of coarsening systems, namely the 1D Ising model with Glauber dynamics. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

The formalism consists of three equations expressing the structural scattering in terms of three equations expressing the sub-unit scattering. The structural scattering expressions allows a composite structures to be used as sub-units within the formalism itself. This allows the scattering expressions for complex hierarchical structures to be derived with great ease. The formalism is furthermore generic in the sense that the scattering due to structural connectivity is completely decoupled from internal structure of the sub-units. This allows sub-units to be replaced by more complex structures. We illustrate the physical interpretation of the formalism diagrammatically. By applying a self-consistency requirement we derive the pair distributions of an ideal flexible polymer sub-unit. We illustrate the formalism by deriving generic scattering expressions for branched structures such as stars, pom-poms, bottle-brushes, and dendrimers build out of asymmetric two-functional sub-units. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft); Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability (physics.data-an)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1108.1156;Classical open systems with nonlinear nonlocal dissipation and  state-dependent diffusion: Dynamical responses and the Jarzynski equality; Hideo Hasegawa (Tokyo Gakugei Univ.);  We have studied dynamical responses and the Jarzynski equality (JE) of classical open systems described by the generalized Caldeira-Leggett model with the nonlocal system-bath coupling. In the derived non-Markovian Langevin equation, the nonlinear nonlocal dissipative term and state-dependent diffusion term yielding multiplicative colored noise satisfy the fluctuation-dissipation relation. Simulation results for harmonic oscillator systems have shown the following: (a) averaged responses of the system $< x >$ to applied sinusoidal and step forces significantly depend on model parameters of magnitudes of additive and multiplicative noises and the relaxation time of colored noise, although stationary marginal probability distribution functions are independent of them, (b) a combined effect of nonlinear dissipation and multiplicative colored noise induces enhanced fluctuations $< [x-< x>]^2 >$ for an applied sinusoidal force, and (c) the JE holds for an applied ramp force independently of the model parameters with a work distribution function which is (symmetric) Gaussian and asymmetric non-Gaussian for additive and multiplicative noises, respectively. It has been shown that the non-Markovian Langevin equation in the local and over-damped limits is quite different from the widely adopted phenomenological Markovian Langevin equation subjected to multiplicative noise. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1108.1225;Statistical Mechanics of the Anomalous Behavior of Tetrahedral Liquids; Itamar Procaccia,  Ido Regev;  Tetrahedral liquids such as water and silica-melt show unusual thermodynamic behavior such as a density maximum and an increase in specific-heat when cooled to low temperatures. There is a debate in the literature whether these phenomena stem from a phase transition into a low-density and high-density liquid phases, which occur in the supercooled regime. Here we consider a model of tetrahedral liquids for which we construct a volume-constrained statistical mechanical theory which quantifies the local structure of the liquid. We compare the theory to molecular dynamics simulations and show that the theory can rationalize the simulations semi-quantitatively. We show that the anomalous density and specific heat behavior arise naturally from this theory without exhibiting a liquid-liquid phase-transition. We explain that this theory may or may not have a phase transition, depending on the volume and temperature dependence of the energy and entropy which are sensitive to small changes in the parameters of the model. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)"

The latter equations are shown to be equivalent to deterministic higher-order differential equations: for an $n$-th order equation with random delay, the corresponding deterministic equation has order $n+1$. We analyze various examples of dynamical systems of this kind, and find a number of unusual behaviors. For instance, for the harmonic oscillator with random delay, the energy grows as $\exp((3/2)\,t^{2/3})$ in reduced units. We then investigate the effect of introducing a discrete time step $\epsilon$. At variance with the continuous situation, the discrete random recursion relations thus obtained have intrinsic fluctuations. The crossover between the fluctuating discrete problem and the deterministic continuous one as $\epsilon$ goes to zero is studied in detail on the example of a first-order linear differential equation. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Disordered Systems and Neural Networks (cond-mat.dis-nn)"

Chodera,  Phillip Elms,  Frank NoÃ©,  Bettina Keller,  Christian M. Kaiser,  Aaron Ewall-Wice,  Susan Marqusee,  Carlos Bustamante,  Nina Singhal Hinrichs;  Single-molecule force spectroscopy has proven to be a powerful tool for studying the kinetic behavior of biomolecules. Through application of an external force, conformational states with small or transient populations can be stabilized, allowing them to be characterized and the statistics of individual trajectories studied to provide insight into biomolecular folding and function. Because the observed quantity (force or extension) is not necessarily an ideal reaction coordinate, individual observations cannot be uniquely associated with kinetically distinct conformations. While maximum-likelihood schemes such as hidden Markov models have solved this problem for other classes of single-molecule experiments by using temporal information to aid in the inference of a sequence of distinct conformational states, these methods do not give a clear picture of how precisely the model parameters are determined by the data due to instrument noise and finite-sample statistics, both significant problems in force spectroscopy. We solve this problem through a Bayesian extension that allows the experimental uncertainties to be directly quantified, and build in detailed balance to further reduce uncertainty through physical constraints. We illustrate the utility of this approach in characterizing the three-state kinetic behavior of an RNA hairpin in a stationary optical trap. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph); Biomolecules (q-bio.BM)"

By including a fugacity $t$ on some suitable bonds, one interpolates between the triangular lattice (t=1) and the square lattice (t=0). The wave function is known to be a massive $\mathbb Z_2$ topological liquid for $t>0$ whereas it is a gapless critical state at t=0. We mainly consider two geometries for the subsystem: that of a semi-infinite cylinder, and the disk-like setup proposed by Kitaev and Preskill [Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 110404 (2006)]. In the cylinder case, the entropies contain an extensive term -- proportional to the length of the boundary -- and a universal sub-leading constant $s_n(t)$. Fitting these cylinder data (up to a perimeter of L=32 sites) provides $s_n$ with a very high numerical accuracy ($10^{-9}$ at t=1 and $10^{-6}$ at $t=0.5$). In the topological $\mathbb{Z}_2$ liquid phase we find $s_n(t>0)=-\ln 2$, independent of the fugacity $t$ and the R\'enyi parameter $n$. At t=0 we recover a previously known result, $s_n(t=0)=-(1/2)\ln(n)/(n-1)$ for $n<1$ and $s_n(t=0)=-\ln(2)/(n-1)$ for $n>1$. In the disk-like geometry -- designed to get rid of the boundary contributions -- we find an entropy $s^{\rm KP}_n(t>0)=-\ln 2$ in the whole massive phase whatever $n>0$, in agreement with the result of Flammia {\it et al.} [Phys.

We also show that in the idealized situation where there are two or more well separated zero modes each associated with a finite number of fermions at a localized vortex, these modes have non-Abelian Ising statistics under braiding.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1108.1813;Capillary-wave models and the effective average action scheme of  functional renormalization group; P. Jakubczyk;  We reexamine the functional renormalization-group theory of wetting transitions. As a starting point of the analysis we apply an exact equation describing renormalization group flow of the generating functional for irreducible vertex functions. We show how the standard nonlinear renormalization group theory of wetting transitions can be recovered by a very simple truncation of the exact flow equation. The derivation makes all the involved approximations transparent and demonstrates the applicability of the approach in any spatial dimension d\geq 2. Exploiting the non-uniqueness of the renormalization-group cutoff scheme, we find however, that the capillary parameter omega is a scheme-dependent quantity below d=3. For d=3 the parameter omega is perfectly robust against scheme variation. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

Here, we study the avalanche time distributions on these load bearing networks. The avalanche time distributions of the V- lattice, a unique realization of the networks, show power-law behavior when tested with certain fractions of its trunk weights. All other avalanche distributions show Gaussian peaked behavior. Thus the V- lattice is the critical case of the network.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1108.1937;Universality in Bacterial Colonies; Juan A. Bonachela,  Carey D. Nadell,  Joao B. Xavier,  Simon A. Levin;  The emergent spatial patterns generated by growing bacterial colonies have been the focus of intense study in physics during the last twenty years. Both experimental and theoretical investigations have made possible a clear qualitative picture of the different structures that such colonies can exhibit, depending on the medium on which they are growing. However, there are relatively few quantitative descriptions of these patterns. In this paper, we use a mechanistically detailed simulation framework to measure the scaling exponents associated with the advancing fronts of bacterial colonies on hard agar substrata, aiming to discern the universality class to which the system belongs. We show that the universal behavior exhibited by the colonies can be much richer than previously reported, and we propose the possibility of up to four different sub-phases within the medium-to-high nutrient concentration regime. We hypothesize that the quenched disorder that characterizes one of these sub-phases is an emergent property of the growth and division of bacteria competing for limited space and nutrients. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems (nlin.AO); Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph); Cell Behavior (q-bio.CB)"

Izrailev;  We study the onset of chaos and statistical relaxation in two isolated dynamical quantum systems of interacting spins-1/2, one of which is integrable and the other chaotic. Our approach to identifying the emergence of chaos is based on the level of delocalization of the eigenstates with respect to the energy shell, the latter being determined by the interaction strength between particles or quasi-particles. We also discuss how the onset of chaos may be anticipated by a careful analysis of the Hamiltonian matrices, even before diagonalization. We find that despite differences between the two models, their relaxation process following a quench is very similar and can be described analytically with a theory previously developed for systems with two-body random interactions. Our results imply that global features of statistical relaxation depend on the degree of spread of the eigenstates within the energy shell and may happen to both integrable and non-integrable systems. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.0204;Resonant Response in Non-equilibrium Steady States; R. Salgado-Garcia;  The time-dependent probability density function of a system evolving towards a stationary state exhibits an oscillatory behavior if the eigenvalues of the corresponding evolution operator are complex. The frequencies \omega_n, with which the system reaches its stationary state, correspond to the imaginary part of such eigenvalues. If the system is further driven by a small and oscillating perturbation with a given frequency \omega, we formally prove that the linear response to the probability density function is enhanced when \omega = \omega_n. We prove that the occurrence of this phenomenon is characteristic of systems that reach a non-equilibrium stationary state. In particular we obtain an explicit formula for the frequency-dependent mobility in terms of the of the relaxation to the stationary state of the (unperturbed) probability current. We test all these predictions by means of numerical simulations considering an ensemble of non-interacting overdamped particles on a tilted periodic potential. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.0212;Random walks in modular scale-free networks with multiple traps; Zhongzhi Zhang,  Yihang Yang,  Yuan Lin;"  Extensive empirical investigation has shown that a plethora of real networks synchronously exhibit scale-free and modular structure, and it is thus of great importance to uncover the effects of these two striking properties on various dynamical processes occurring on such networks. In this paper, we examine two cases of random walks performed on a class of modular scale-free networks with multiple traps located at several given nodes. We first derive a formula of the mean first-passage time (MFPT) for a general network, which is the mean of the expected time to absorption originating from a specific node, averaged over all non-trap starting nodes. Although the computation is complex, the expression of the formula is exact; moreover, the computational approach and procedure are independent of the number and position of the traps. We then determine analytically the MFPT for the two random walks being considered. The obtained analytical results are in complete agreement with the numerical ones. Our results show that the number and location of traps play an important role in the behavior of the MFPT, since for both cases the MFPT grows as a power-law function of the number of nodes, but their exponents are quite different. We demonstrate that the root of the difference in the behavior of MFPT is attributed to the modular and scale-free topologies of the networks. This work can deepen the understanding of diffusion on networks with modular and scale-free architecture and motivate relevant studies for random walks running on complex random networks with multiple traps.

This process has a rich combinatorial spectral structure and a matrix product form for the stationary state. In the totally asymmetric case operators that conjugate the dynamics of systems with different numbers of species were obtained by the authors and reported recently. The existence of such nontrivial operators was reformulated as a representation problem for a specific quadratic algebra (generalized matrix Ansatz). In the present work, we construct the family of representations explicitly for the partially asymmetric case. This solution cannot be obtained by a simple deformation of the totally asymmetric case. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)"

The effect of clustering coefficient on the occurrence probability of the states of three classes is analyzed numerically for Watts-Strogatz and scale-free networks. We further study the effect of clustering coefficient on the robustness for the states of each class by proposing a stochastic local majority-rule. The states of period-2 are found to be easy to break up, and the trapped states are most robust among the three classes. For systems in noisy environments, the proposed stochastic local majority-rule shows that there exists a range of noise for which, the mean first-passage time from strongly disorder states to the states of system-wide coordination is the shortest. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)"

We focus on the effect of mesoscopic fluctuations in the disordered phase. The pressure -- volume fraction isotherms are calculated explicitly for two forms of the short-range attraction long-range repulsion potential. Mesoscopic fluctuations lead to an increased pressure in each case, except for very small volume fractions. When large clusters are formed, the mechanical instability of the system is present at much higher temperature than found in mean-field approximation. In this case phase separation competes with the formation of periodic phases (colloidal crystals). In the case of small clusters, no mechanical instability associated with separation into dilute and dense phases appears. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.0471;Time Reversibility of Quantum Diffusion in Small-world Networks; Sung-Guk Han,  Beom Jun Kim;  We study the time-reversal dynamics of a tight-binding electron in the Watts-Strogatz (WS) small-world networks. The localized initial wave packet at time $t=0$ diffuses as time proceeds until the time-reversal operation, together with the momentum perturbation of the strength $\eta$, is made at the reversal time $T$. The time irreversibility is measured by $I \equiv |\Pi(t = 2T) - \Pi(t = 0)|$, where $\Pi$ is the participation ratio gauging the extendedness of the wavefunction and for convenience, $t$ is measured forward even after the time reversal . When $\eta = 0$, the time evolution after $T$ makes the wavefunction at $t=2T$ identical to the one at $t=0$, and we find I=0, implying a null irreversibility or a complete reversibility. On the other hand, as $\eta$ is increased from zero, the reversibility becomes weaker, and we observe enhancement of the irreversibility. We find that $I$ linearly increases with increasing $\eta$ in the weakly-perturbed region, and that the irreversibility is much stronger in the WS network than in the local regular network. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

Adrian Parsegian,  Rudolf Podgornik;  Relaxation of the thermal Casimir or van der Waals force for a model dielectric medium is investigated. We start with a model of interacting polarization fields with a dynamics that leads to a frequency dependent dielectric constant of the Debye form. In the static limit the usual zero frequency Matsubara mode component of the Casimir force is recovered. We then consider the out of equilibrium relaxation of the van der Waals force to its equilibrium value when two initially uncorrelated dielectric bodies are brought into sudden proximity. It is found that the spatial dependence of the out of equilibrium force is the same as the equilibrium one but it has a time dependent amplitude, or Hamaker coefficient, which increases in time to its equilibrium value. The final relaxation to the equilibrium value is exponential in systems with a single or finite number of polarization field relaxation times. However, in systems, such as those described by the Havriliak-Negami dielectric constant, with a broad distribution of relaxation times, we observe a much slower power law decay to the equilibrium value. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

Husimi, Prog. Theor. Phys. {\bf 9}, 381 (1953)]. It has been shown that the response to a uniform force expressed by the Hamiltonian: $H_f= -f(t) \sum_{k=1}^{N_S} Q_k$ is generally not proportional to $N_S$ except for no system-bath couplings, where $f(t)$ expresses its time dependence and $Q_k$ denotes a position operator of $k$th particle of the system. We have calculated also the response to a space- and time-dependent force expressed by $H_f= -f(t) \sum_{k=1}^{N_S} Q_k \: e^{i 2 \pi k u/N_S}$, where the wavevector $u$ is $u=0$ and $u=-N_S/2$ for uniform and staggered forces, respectively. The spatial correlation $\Gamma_m$ for a pair of positions of $Q_k$ and $Q_{k+m}$ has been studied as functions of $N_S$ and the temperature. Our calculations have indicated an importance of taking account of finite $N_S$ in studying quantum open systems which generally include arbitrary numbers of particles. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

Rutkevich;"  This preprint contains the English translation of the paper ""Relaxation dynamics of a quantum chain of harmonic oscillators"", which was published by the author in 1980 in the Ukrainian Physical Journal. Comments describing its motivations, background ideas and results are presented as well. This paper addressed to the problem of approach to the thermal equilibrium in an isolated macroscopic quantum system, which was studied on the example of the quantum chain of weakly interacting harmonic oscillators. In the initial state, macroscopic energy was supplied to one oscillator (atom) in the chain. Subsequent evolution of the quantum state of the whole chain was determined due to the model integrability. The main subject of interest was the time evolution of the reduced density operators characterizing the quantum state of a particular atom. On the short time-scale, the energy perturbation expands along the chain with the velocity of the fastest phonon mode. On the long-time scale, the single-atom density operators display strong fluctuations around the canonical Gibbs distribution. These fluctuations are caused by the degeneracy of the energy level differences (presence of resonances) in the model of coupled harmonic oscillators. After lifting this degeneracy, fluctuations are suppressed providing, that the reduced density operator of each atom in the chain becomes very close to the Gibbs distribution at almost any time moment.

The dot is driven by an external stochastic force that switches its energy between two values. In the isothermal regime, it can operate as a rechargeable battery by generating an electric current against the applied bias in response to the stochastic driving, and re-delivering work in the reverse cycle. This behavior is reminiscent of the Parrondo paradox. If there is a thermal gradient the device can function as a work-generating thermal engine, or as a refrigerator that extracts heat from the cold reservoir via the work input of the stochastic driving. The efficiency of the machine at maximum power output is investigated for each mode of operation, and universal features are identified. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.0677;Itinerant electrons in the Coulomb phase; L. D. C. Jaubert,  Swann Piatecki,  Masudul Haque,  R. Moessner;  We study the interplay between magnetic frustration and itinerant electrons. For example, how does the coupling to mobile charges modify the properties of a spin liquid, and does the underlying frustration favor insulating or conducting states? Supported by Monte Carlo simulations, our goal is in particular to provide an analytical picture of the mechanisms involved. The models under considerations exhibit Coulomb phases in two and three dimensions, where the itinerant electrons are coupled to the localized spins via double exchange interactions. Because of the Hund coupling, magnetic loops naturally emerge from the Coulomb phase and serve as conducting channels for the mobile electrons, leading to doping-dependent rearrangements of the loop ensemble in order to minimize the electronic kinetic energy. At low electron density \rho, the double exchange coupling mainly tends to segment the very long loops winding around the system into smaller ones while it gradually lifts the extensive degeneracy of the Coulomb phase with increasing \rho. For higher doping, the results are strongly lattice dependent, displaying loop crystals with a given loop length for some specific values of \rho, which can melt into another loop crystal by varying \rho. Finally, we contrast this to the qualitatively different behavior of analogous models on kagome or triangular lattices. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)"

Consistent with previous work on entanglement spectra of topological band structures, we find that the entanglement levels exhibit a spectral flow similar to that of the full system's energy spectrum. While the energy spectra are continuous, with open boundary conditions the entanglement spectra exhibit discontinuities associated with the passage of an energy edge state through the Fermi level. We show how the entanglement spectrum can be understood by examining the band projectors of the full system and their behavior under adiabatic pumping. In so doing we make connections with the original TKNN work on topological two-dimensional band structures and their Chern numbers. Finally we consider Wannier states and their adiabatic flows, and draw connections to the entanglement properties. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.0760;Vlasov dynamics of 1D models with long-range interactions; Pierre de Buyl;  Gravitational and electrostatic interactions are fundamental examples of systems with long-range interactions. Equilibrium properties of simple models with long-range interactions are well understood and exhibit exotic behaviors : negative specific heat and inequivalence of statistical ensembles for instance. The understanding of the dynamical evolution in the case of long-range interacting systems still represents a theoretical challenge. Phenomena such as out-of-equilibrium phase transitions or quasi-stationary states have been found even in simple models. The purpose of the present thesis is to investigate the dynamical properties of systems with long-range interactions, specializing on one-dimensional models. The appropriate kinetic description for these systems is the Vlasov equation. A numerical simulation tool for the Vlasov equation is developed. A detailed study of the out-of-equilibrium phase transition occuring in the Free-Electron Laser is performed and the transition is analyzed with the help of Lynden-Bell's theory. Then, the presence of stretching and folding in phase space for the Hamiltonian Mean-Field model is studied and quantified from the point of view of fluid dynamics. Finally, a system of uncoupled pendula for which the asymptotic states are similar to the ones of the Hamiltonian Mean-Field model is introduced. Its asymptotic evolution is predicted via both Lynden-Bell's theory and an exact computation. This system displays a fast initial evolution similar to the violent relaxation found for interacting systems. Moreover, an out-of-equilibrium phase transition is found if one imposes a self-consistent condition on the system. In summary, the present thesis discusses original results related to the occurence of quasi-stationary states and out-of-equilibrium phase transitions in 1D models with long-range interaction. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

The problems in continuum mechanics concern mathematical modelling of viscoelastic bodies (Sect. 1), and unsteady motion of a particle in a viscous fluid, i.e. the Basset problem (Sect. 2). In the former analysis fractional calculus leads us to introduce intermediate models of viscoelasticity which generalize the classical spring-dashpot models. The latter analysis induces us to introduce a hydrodynamic model suitable to revisit in Sect. 3 the classical theory of the Brownian motion, which is a relevant topic in statistical mechanics. By the tools of fractional calculus we explain the long tails in the velocity correlation and in the displacement variance. In Sect. 4 we consider the fractional diffusion-wave equation, which is obtained from the classical diffusion equation by replacing the first-order time derivative by a fractional derivative of order $0< \beta <2$. Led by our analysis we express the fundamental solutions (the Green functions) in terms of two interrelated auxiliary functions in the similarity variable, which turn out to be of Wright type (see Appendix), and to distinguish slow-diffusion processes ($0 < \beta < 1$) from intermediate processes ($1 < \beta < 2$). ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)"

It has recently been found that a small perturbation of a generic class of jump rates leads to a drastic change of the phase diagram and prevents condensation in an extended parameter range. We complement this study with rigorous results on a finite critical density and quenched free energy in the thermodynamic limit, as well as quantitative heuristic results for small and large noise which are supported by detailed simulation data. While our new results support the initial findings, they also shed new light on the actual (limited) relevance in large finite systems, which we discuss via fundamental diagrams obtained from exact numerics for finite systems. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Probability (math.PR)"

We emulate it as a two-time conditional expectation in a classical stochastic model. We use the well known symmetrized form of the master equation, which is formally equivalent to the wave equation in quantum mechanics apart from the fact that wave functions are always real. The origin of the unusual behaviors of the weak value such as the negative probability and the abnormal enhancement of some expectations becomes clearer in the present case, where the two-time conditional probability has no ambiguity of imaginary/complex values. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

Burda;"  We provide analytical solutions for two types of random walk: generic random walk (GRW) and maximal entropy random walk (MERW) on a Cayley tree with arbitrary branching number, root degree, and number of generations. For MERW, we obtain the stationary state given by the squared elements of the eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue $\lambda_0$ of the adjacency matrix. We discuss the dynamics, depending on the second largest eigenvalue $\lambda_1$, of the probability distribution approaching to the stationary state. We find different scaling of the relaxation time with the system size, which is generically shorter for MERW than for GRW. We also signal that depending on the initial conditions there are relaxations associated with lower eigenvalues which are induced by symmetries of the tree. In general, we find that there are three regimes of a tree structure resulting in different statics and dynamics of MERW; these correspond to strongly, critically, and weakly branched roots.

Parrondo,  Ewa Gudowska-Nowak;  For systems close to equilibrium, the relaxation properties of measurable physical quantities are described by the linear response theory and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT). Accordingly, the response or the generalized susceptibility, which is a function of the unperturbed equilibrium system, can be related to the correlation between spontaneous fluctuations of a given conjugate variable. There have been several attempts to extend the FDT far from equilibrium, introducing new terms or using effective temperatures. Recently, Prost, Joanny, and Parrondo [Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 090601 (2009)] have shown that the FDT can be restored far from equilibrium by choosing the appropriate variables conjugate to the external perturbations. Here, we apply the generalized FDT to a system perturbed by time-dependent deterministic forces and acting under the influence of white alpha-stable noises. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

Exact expressions for the expectation values of the spin at each site are obtained, in terms of the time dependent boundary condition and the initial conditions. The solution consists of a transient part which is due to the initial condition, and a part driven by the boundary. The latter is an evanescent wave when the boundary spin is oscillating harmonically. Low- and high-frequency limits are investigated with greater detail. The total magnetization of the lattice is also obtained. It is seen that for any arbitrary rapidly varying boundary conditions, this total magnetization is equal to the the boundary spin itself, plus essentially the time integral of the boundary spin. A nonuniform model is also investigated. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.1993;Percolation analysis of force networks in anisotropic granular matter; Romualdo Pastor-Satorras,  M.-Carmen Miguel;  We study the percolation properties of force networks in an anisotropic model for granular packings, the so-called q-model. Following the original recipe of Ostojic et al. [Nature 439, 828 (2006)], we consider a percolation process in which forces smaller than a given threshold f are deleted in the network. For a critical threshold f_c, the system experiences a transition akin to percolation. We determine the point of this transition and its characteristic critical exponents applying a finite-size scaling analysis that takes explicitly into account the directed nature of the q-model. By means of extensive numerical simulations, we show that this percolation transition is strongly affected by the anisotropic nature of the model, yielding characteristic exponents which are neither those found in isotropic granular systems nor those in the directed version of standard percolation. The differences shown by the computed exponents can be related to the presence of strong directed correlations and mass conservation laws in the model under scrutiny. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

The models show dissipation through fluctuation induced friction near the critical point. We first consider high driving velocities and demonstrate that both systems are in the same universality class and undergo a strongly anisotropic non-equilibrium phase transition, with anisotropy exponent \theta=3. Within a field theoretical ansatz the simulation results are confirmed. The crossover from Ising to mean field behavior in dependency of system size and driving velocity is analyzed using crossover scaling. It turns out that for all finite velocities the phase transition becomes strongly anisotropic in the thermodynamic limit. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)"

We find that in both cases the entropy of patches of linear size l, Sigma(l), scales as s_c l^d+A l^{d-1} down to length-scales of the order of one, where A is a positive constant, s_c is the configurational entropy density and d the spatial dimension. In consequence, the only meaningful length that can be defined from patch-repetition is the cross-over length xi=A/s_c. We relate xi to the typical length-scales already discussed in the literature and show that it is always of the order of the largest static length. Our results provide new insights, which are particularly relevant for RFOT theory, on the possible real space structure of super-cooled liquids. They suggest that this structure differs from a mosaic of different patches having roughly the same size. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Disordered Systems and Neural Networks (cond-mat.dis-nn); Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.2361;Stochastic Description of a Bistable Frustrated Unit; Ashok Garai,  Bartlomiej Waclaw,  Hannes Nagel,  Hildegard Meyer-Ortmanns;  Mixed positive and negative feedback loops are often found in biological systems which support oscillations. In this work we consider a prototype of such systems, which has been recently found at the core of many genetic circuits showing oscillatory behaviour. Our model consists of two interacting species A and B, where A activates not only its own production, but also that of its repressor B. While the self-activation of A leads already to a bistable unit, the coupling with a negative feedback loop via B makes the unit frustrated. In the deterministic limit of infinitely many molecules, such a bistable frustrated unit is known to show excitable and oscillatory dynamics, depending on the maximum production rate of A which acts as a control parameter. We study this model in its fully stochastic version and we find oscillations even for parameters which in the deterministic limit are deeply in the fixed-point regime. The deeper we go into this regime, the more irregular these oscillations are, becoming finally random excitations whenever fluctuations allow the system to overcome the barrier for a large excursion in phase space. The fluctuations can no longer be fully treated as a perturbation. The smaller the system size (the number of molecules), the more frequent are these excitations. Therefore, stochasticity caused by demographic noise makes this unit even more flexible with respect to its oscillatory behaviour. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph)"

In the framework of the quantum Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy, we introduce an unconventional representation, different from the usual cluster expansion, which casts the hierarchy into the form of a second-order recursion. This structure suggests a scaling of the expansion coefficients and the corresponding time scales in powers of $N^{1/2}$ with the system size $N$, implying a separation of time scales in the large system limit. For special parameter values and initial conditions, we can show analytically that closing the BBGKY hierarchy by neglecting $\ell$-spin correlations does never lead to equilibration, but gives rise to quasi-periodic time evolution with at most $\ell/2$ independent frequencies. Moreover, for the same special parameter values and in the large-$N$ limit, we solve the complete recursion relation (the full BBGKY hierarchy), observing a superexponential decay to equilibrium in rescaled time $\tau=tN^{-1/2}$. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)"

This provides a new concept of ""macroscopic barrier-crossing nucleation"".

During this GAP, the edge with minimum product of two connecting cluster sizes is taken with a probability $p$ from two randomly chosen edges. This model becomes the Erd\H os-R\'enyi network at $p=0.5$ and the random network under the Achlioptas process at $p=1$. Using both the fixed point of $s_2/s_1$ and the straight line of $\ln s_1$, where $s_1$ and $s_2$ are the reduced sizes of the largest and the second largest cluster, we demonstrate that the phase transitions of this model are continuous for $0.5 \le p \le 1$. From the slopes of $\ln s_1$ and $\ln (s_2/s_1)'$ at the critical point we get the critical exponents $\beta$ and $\nu$, which depend on $p$. Therefore the universality class of this model should be characterized by $p$ also. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

The regime of large deviations is separated from the regime of typical fluctuations by a phase transition where the symmetry between the points in the sample is spontaneously broken. For stochastic processes with a fat tailed microscopic noise, this implies that while typical realizations are well described by a diffusion process with continuous sample paths, large deviation paths are typically discontinuous. For eigenvalues of random matrices with fat tailed distributed elements, a large deviation where the trace of the matrix is anomalously large concentrates on just a single eigenvalue, whereas in the thin tailed world the large deviation affects the whole distribution. These results find a natural application to finance. Since the price dynamics of financial stocks is characterized by fat tailed increments, large fluctuations of stock prices are expected to be realized by discrete jumps. Interestingly, we find that large excursions of prices are more likely realized by continuous drifts rather than by discontinuous jumps. Indeed, auto-correlations suppress the concentration of large deviations. Financial covariance matrices also exhibit an anomalously large eigenvalue, the market mode, as compared to the prediction of random matrix theory. We show that this is explained by a large deviation with excess covariance rather than by one with excess volatility. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability (physics.data-an); Risk Management (q-fin.RM)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.2855;Multiple phase transitions in a system of exclusion processes with  limited reservoirs of particles and fuel carriers; Chris A. Brackley,  Luca Ciandrini,  M. Carmen Romano;"  The TASEP is a paradigmatic model from non-equilibrium statistical physics, which describes particles hopping along a lattice of discrete sites. The TASEP is applicable to a broad range of different transport systems, but does not consider the fact that in many such systems the availability of resources required for the transport is limited. In this paper we extend the TASEP to include the effect of a limited number of two different fundamental transport resources: the hopping particles, and the ""fuel carriers"", which provide the energy required to drive the system away from equilibrium. As as consequence, the system's dynamics are substantially affected: a ""limited resources"" regime emerges, where the current is limited by the rate of refuelling, and the usual coexistence line between low and high particle density opens into a broad region on the phase plane. Due to the combination of a limited amount of both resources, multiple phase transitions are possible when increasing the exit rate beta for a fixed entry rate alpha. This is a new feature that can only be obtained by the inclusion of both kinds of limited resources. We also show that the fluctuations in particle density in the LD and HD phases are unaffected by fluctuations in the number of loaded fuel carriers, except by the fact that when these fuel resources become limited, the particle hopping rate is severely reduced.

Padding;  We study how varying the P \'eclet number (Pe) affects the steady state sedimentation of colloidal particles that interact through short-ranged attractions. By employing a hybrid molecular dynamics simulation method we demonstrate that the average sedimentation velocity changes from a non- monotonic dependence on packing fraction {\phi} at low Pe numbers, to a monotonic decrease with {\phi} at higher Pe numbers. At low Pe number the pair correlation functions are close to their equilibrium values, but as the Pe number increases, important deviations from equilibrium forms are observed. Although the attractive forces we employ are not strong enough to form permanent clusters, they do induce transient clusters whose behaviour is also affected by Pe number. In particular, clusters are more likely to fragment and less likely to aggregate at larger Pe numbers, and the probability of finding larger clusters decreases with increasing Pe number. Interestingly, the life-time of the clusters is more or less independent of Pe number in the range we study. Instead, the change in cluster distribution occurs because larger clusters are less likely to form with increasing Pe number. These results illustrate some of the subtleties that occur in the crossover from equilibrium like to purely non-equilibrium behaviour as the balance between convective and thermal forces changes. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)"

On this basis, it is shown that, when considering more than two noninteracting electrons, the energy of such a system cannot be an inhomogeneous density functional. The result is extended for the system of interacting electrons. This means that the Hohenberg-Kohn lemma which assert that in the ground state to each inhomogeneous density corresponds only one potential of the external field cannot be a justification of the existence of the universal density functional in the general case. At the same time, statements of the density functional theory remain valid when considering any number of noninteracting ground-state bosons due to the Bose condensation effect. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

Although pressure and temperature are too low to induce an equilibrium smectic phase, the fluctuations of the pressure in the NEQ steady state match the pressure fluctuations characteristic of the equilibrium smectic phase. Furthermore, the {\it wall-normal} pressure fluctuations give rise to a {\it tangential} ""fluctuation-vorticity"" tensor that specifies the symmetry-breaking direction of the smectic layers. Our calculations demonstrate a novel method through which nanomaterials with a high degree of molecular order may be manufactured in principle.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.3312;Evaporatively driven morphological instability; Robert W. Style,  John. S. Wettlaufer;  Simple observations of evaporating solutions reveal a complex hierarchy of spatio-temporal instabilities. We analyze one such instability suggested by the qualitative observations of Du and Stone and find that it is driven by a novel variant of the classical {\em morphological instability} in alloy solidification. In the latter case a moving solid-liquid interface is accompanied by a solutally enriched boundary layer that is thermodynamically metastable due to {\em constitutional supercooling}. Here, we consider the evaporation of an impure film adjacent to a solid composed of the nonvolatile species. In this case, constitutional supercooling within the film is created by evaporation at the solution-vapor interface and this drives the corrugation of the solid--solution interface across the thickness of the film. The principal points of this simple theoretical study are to suggest an instability mechanism that is likely operative across a broad range of technological and natural systems and to focus future quantitative experimental searches. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.3420;Understanding critical behavior in the framework of the extended  equilibrium fluctuation theorem; L. Velazquez,  S. Curilef;  Recently (arXiv:0910.2870), we have derived a fluctuation theorem for systems in thermodynamic equilibrium compatible with anomalous response functions, e.g. the existence of states with \textit{negative heat capacities} $C<0$. In this work, we show that the present approach of the fluctuation theory introduces new insights in the understanding of \textit{critical phenomena}. Specifically, the new theorem predicts that the environmental influence can radically affect critical behavior of systems, e.g. to provoke a suppression of the divergence of correlation length $\xi$ and some of its associated phenomena as spontaneous symmetry breaking. Our analysis reveals that while response functions and state equations are \emph{intrinsic properties} for a given system, critical behaviors are always \emph{relative phenomena}, that is, their existence crucially depend on the underlying environmental influence. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

We simulate a system of model hard particles with attractive patches and show that they can self-assemble into a diamond structure from an initially disordered state. We quantify the extent to which the formation of the diamond structure can be facilitated by ""seeding"" the system with small diamond crystallites or by introducing a rotation interaction to mimic a carbon-carbon antibonding interaction. Our results suggest patchy particles may serve as colloidal ""atoms"" and ""molecules"" for the bottom-up self-assembly of three-dimensional crystals. ";Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

The system we consider is a scattering configuration, composed of a finite periodic chain of $L$ identical (classically chaotic and finite-horizon) unit cells, which is connected to semi-infinite plane leads at its extremes. Particles inside the cavity are free and only interact with the boundaries through elastic collisions; this means waves are described by the Helmholtz equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions on the waveguide walls. The equivalent to the disorder ensemble is an energy ensemble, defined over a classically small range but many mean level spacings wide. The number of propagative channels in the leads is $N$. We have studied the (adimensional) Landauer conductance $g$ as a function of $L$ and $N$ in the cosine-shaped waveguide and by means of our RMT periodic chain model. We have found that $<g(L)>$ exhibit two regimes. First, for chains of length $L\lesssim\sqrt{N}$ the dynamics is diffusive just like in the disordered wire in the metallic regime, where the typic ohmic scaling is observed with $<g(L)> = N/(L+1)$. In this regime, the conductance distribution is a Gaussian with small variance but which grows linearly with $L$. Then, in longer systems with $L\gg\sqrt{N}$, the periodic nature becomes relevant and the conductance reaches a constant asymptotic value $<g(L\to\infty)> \sim <N_B>$. The variance approaches a constant value $\sim\sqrt{N}$ as $L\to\infty$. Comparing the conductance using the unitary and orthogonal circular ensembles we observed that a weak localization effect is present in the two regimes.

Lukes;  A Rayleigh B\'enard instability study using the energy conserving dissipative particle dynamics method is presented here for the first time. The simulation is performed on an ideal dissipative particle dynamics fluid in a three dimensional domain with carefully selected parameters to make the convection terms in the equation more dominant than the conduction ones. Beyond a critical temperature difference a two cell pattern is observed as the dominant structure. As the temperature is increased further, the density changes in the system are sharp with formation of distinct high density layers close to the cold wall. Doubling the length of the domain led to the formation of four convection cells with the same cell diameter as before, confirming the invariance of the pattern formation in that dimension. Changes in the height of the domain led to cells with more uniform looking patterns. The results and patterns seen here are qualitatively similar to previous studies performed on rarefied gases. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)"

We consider global quenches, when the parameters are modified uniformly in space, as well as local quenches, when two disconnected blocks are suddenly joined together. For a non-critical final state, the dynamical entanglement entropy is found to approach a finite limiting value for both types of quenches. If the quench is performed to the critical state, the entropy grows for an infinite block as S(t) \sim ln ln t. This type of ultraslow increase is explained through the strong disorder renormalization group method. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Disordered Systems and Neural Networks (cond-mat.dis-nn); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

We show that both the replica symmetric and the replica symmetry breaking approximations give maximum rates of packing that are asymptotically the same as the lower bound of Gilbert and Varshamov. Consistently with known numerical results, the replica symmetric equations also suggest a crystalline solution, where for even diameters the spheres are more likely to be found in one of the subspaces (even or odd) of the Hamming space. These crystalline packings can be generated by a recursive algorithm which finds maximum packings in an ultra-metric space. Finally, we design a message passing algorithm based on the cavity equations to find dense packings of hard spheres. Known maximum packings are reproduced efficiently in non trivial ranges of dimensions and number of spheres. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

This paper provides a complete derivation of those results, more explicit expressions for the energy flux, and a more detailed characterization of the system at arbitrary $T_c$ and $T_h$. We consider the two-point correlation functions and the energy flux $F(x)$ between each spin, located at integer position $x$, and its associated heat bath. In the $T_h \rightarrow \infty$ limit, the flux $F(x)$ decays exponentially into the cold bath (spins with $x=1,2,...$) for all $T_c>0$ and transitions into a power law decay as $T_c \rightarrow 0$. We find an asymptotic expansion for large $x$ in terms of modified Bessel functions that captures both of these behaviors. We perform Monte Carlo simulations that give excellent agreement with both the exact and asymptotic results for $F(x)$. The simulations are also used to study the system at arbitrary $T_h$ and $T_c$. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

The transition probability in the Markov chain depends on a set of occupation numbers, which reflects the property of a zero-dimensional cavity to hold at most one particle. For given mean occupation numbers (density profile), an exact expression for the equilibrium distribution of microstates is obtained, that means an expression for the unique external potential that generates the density profile in equilibrium. By considering the rod ends to fall onto lattice sites, the mixture is always additive. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

We provide a theoretical analysis of the phase diagram, valid when the flow in the bottleneck is dominated by local stationary states. In particular, we predict and find an inhomogeneous high density phase, with a striped spatio-temporal structure. At the same time, our results also show that some other features of the model cannot be explained by the stationarity hypothesis and require consideration of the transients in the bottleneck at each reversal of the flow. In particular, we show that for short bottlenecks, the capacity of the system is at least as high as for uni-directional flow, in spite of having to empty the bottleneck at each reversal - a feature that can be explained only by efficient transients. Looking at more sensitive quantities like the distribution of flipping times, we show that, in most regimes, the bottleneck is driven by rare fluctuations and descriptions beyond the stationary state are required. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

By comparing the key functions obtained from SCSs for the Achlioptas processes (APs) with a product rule and a sum rule to the prototype functions, we show that the percolation transition of AP models on the Bethe lattice is continuous regardless of details of growth rules. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

In this paper, we perform a study on the enumeration of spanning trees in a specific small-world network with an exponential distribution of vertex degrees, which is called a Farey graph since it is associated with the famous Farey sequence. According to the particular network structure, we provide some recursive relations governing the Laplacian characteristic polynomials of a Farey graph and its subgraphs. Then, making use of these relations obtained here, we derive the exact number of spanning trees in the Farey graph, as well as an approximate numerical solution for the asymptotic growth constant characterizing the network. Finally, we compare our results with those of different types of networks previously investigated. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)

As an illustration of this claim, we use our formalism to highlight unusual behaviors of the size and composition of the components (small and giant) in a synthetic, albeit realistic, social network. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Social and Information Networks (cs.SI); Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph); Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.4922;Numerical Renormalization Group for the sub-ohmic spin-boson model: A  conspiracy of errors; Matthias Vojta;  The application of Wilson's Numerical Renormalization Group (NRG) method to dissipative quantum impurity models, in particular the sub-ohmic spin-boson model, has led to conclusions regarding the quantum critical behavior which are in disagreement with those from other methods and which are by now recognized as erroneous. The errors of NRG remained initially undetected because NRG delivered an internally consistent set of critical exponents satisfying hyperscaling. Here we discuss how the conspiracy of two errors - the Hilbert-space truncation error and the mass-flow error - could lead to this consistent set of exponents. Remarkably, both errors, albeit of different origin, force the system to obey naive scaling laws even when the physical model violates naive scaling. In particular, we show that a combination of the Hilbert-space truncation and mass-flow errors induce an artificial non-analytic term in the Landau expansion of the free energy which dominates the critical behavior for bath exponents s<1/2. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)"

Stryzheus,  Erio Tosatti (SISSA/ISAS, CNR-IOM, ICTP);  We discuss the role of the long-range elastic interaction between the contacts inside an inhomogeneous frictional interface. The interaction produces a characteristic elastic correlation length $\lambda_c = a^2 E / k_c$ (where $a$ is the distance between the contacts, $k_c$ is the elastic constant of a contact, and $E$ is the Young modulus of the sliding body), below which the slider may be considered as a rigid body. The strong inter-contact interaction leads to a narrowing of the effective threshold distribution for contact breaking and enhances the chances for an elastic instability to appear. Above the correlation length, $r > \lambda_c$, the interaction leads to screening of local perturbations in the interface, or to appearance of collective modes --- frictional cracks propagating as solitary waves. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Classical Physics (physics.class-ph)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.5213;Nonequilibrium representative ensembles for isolated quantum systems; V. I. Yukalov;  An isolated quantum system is considered, prepared in a nonequilibrium initial state. In order to uniquely define the system dynamics, one has to construct a representative statistical ensemble. From the principle of least action it follows that the role of the evolution generator is played by a grand Hamiltonian, but not merely by its energy part. A theorem is proved expressing the commutators of field operators with operator products through variational derivatives of these products. A consequence of this theorem is the equivalence of the variational equations for field operators with the Heisenberg equations for the latter. A finite quantum system cannot equilibrate in the strict sense. But it can tend to a quasi-stationary state characterized by ergodic averages and the appropriate representative ensemble depending on initial conditions. Microcanonical ensemble, arising in the eigenstate thermalization, is just a particular case of representative ensembles. Quasi-stationary representative ensembles are defined by the principle of minimal information. The latter also implies the minimization of an effective thermodynamic potential. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)"

This variation may be quantified using an order parameter and reveals a novel phase behaviour including random tiling with varying critical properties as well as ordered phases dominated by either parallel or non-parallel alignment of neighbouring molecules, consistent with long-standing theoretical studies. The balance between order and randomness is driven by small differences in the intermolecular interaction energies, which we show, using numerical simulations, can be related to the measured order parameter. Significant variations occur even when the energy difference is much less than the thermal energy highlighting the delicate balance between entropic and energetic effects in complex self-assembly processes. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)"

Central Brownian particle is elastically coupled to surrounding auxiliary Brownian quasi-particles which account for the influence of viscoelastic environment. Similar to standard dynamical modeling of Brownian motion, the external force influences only the motion of central particle not affecting directly the environmental degrees of freedom (see video). Just a handful of auxiliary Brownian particles suffice to model subdiffusion over many temporal decades. Time-modulation of the potential violates the symmetry of thermal detailed balance and induces anomalous subdiffusive current which exhibits a remarkable quality at low temperatures, as well as a number of other surprising features such as saturation at low temperatures, and multiple inversions of the transport direction upon a change of the driving frequency in nonadiabatic regime.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.5306;A scaling theory for the quasi-deterministic limit; David A. Kessler,  Nadav M. Shnerb;  Deterministic rate equations are widely used in the study of stochastic, interacting particles systems. This approach assumes that the inherent noise, associated with the discreteness of the elementary constituents, may be neglected when the number of particles $N$ is large. Accordingly, it fails close to the extinction transition, when the amplitude of stochastic fluctuations is comparable with the size of the population. Here we present a general scaling theory of the transition regime for spatially extended systems. Two fundamental models for out-of-equilibrium phase transitions are considered: the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) that belongs to the directed percolation equivalence class, and the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model belonging to the dynamic percolation class. Implementing the Ginzburg criteria we show that the width of the fluctuation-dominated region scales like $N^{-\kappa}$, where $N$ is the number of individuals per site and $\kappa = 2/(d_u-d)$, $d_u$ is the upper critical dimension. Other exponents that control the approach to the deterministic limit are shown to depend on $\kappa$. The theory is supported by the results of extensive numerical simulations for systems of various dimensionalities. ;Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.5308;Is subdiffusional transport slower than normal?; Igor Goychuk;"  We consider anomalous non-Markovian transport of Brownian particles in viscoelastic fluid-like media with very large but finite macroscopic viscosity under the influence of a constant force field F. The viscoelastic properties of the medium are characterized by a power-law viscoelastic memory kernel which ultra slow decays in time on the time scale \tau of strong viscoelastic correlations. The subdiffusive transport regime emerges transiently for t<\tau. However, the transport becomes asymptotically normal for t>>\tau. It is shown that even though transiently the mean displacement and the variance both scale sublinearly, i.e. anomalously slow, in time, <\delta x(t)> ~ F t^\alpha, <\delta x^2(t)> ~ t^\alpha, 0<\alpha<1, the mean displacement at each instant of time is nevertheless always larger than one obtained for normal transport in a purely viscous medium with the same macroscopic viscosity obtained in the Markovian approximation. This can have profound implications for the subdiffusive transport in biological cells as the notion of ""ultra-slowness"" can be misleading in the context of anomalous diffusion-limited transport and reaction processes occurring on nano- and mesoscales.

Secondly, we show that the temporal activity in the model is inherently non-stationary, and obtain from here justification and support for the concept of a ""seismic cycle"" in the temporal evolution of seismic activity. Finally, we ask for the reasons that make the model display a realistic value of the decaying exponent $b$ in the Gutenberg-Richter law for the avalanche size distribution. We explain why relaxation induces a systematic increase of $b$ from its value $b\simeq 0.4$ observed in the absence of relaxation. However, we have not been able to justify the actual robustness of the model in displaying a consistent $b$ value around the experimentally observed value $b\simeq 1$.

We propose a numerically efficient tracking method for finding the position and velocity of defects, and apply it to vortices in a uniform field and dislocations in anisotropic stripe patterns. During relaxational dynamics, the distribution function of the velocity fuctuations is characterized by a dynamical scaling with a scaling function that has a robust algebraic tail with an inverse cube power law. This is characteristic to defects of codimension two, e.g. point defects in two dimensions and filaments in three dimensions, regardless of whether the motion is isotropic (as for vortices) or highly anisotropic (as for dislocations). However, the anisotropic dislocation motion leads to anisotropic statistical properties when the interaction between defects and their motion is in infuenced by the presence of an external shear flow transverse to the stripe orientation. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.5775;Single-Particle Dynamics in Dense Granular Fluids under Driving; Matthias Sperl,  Wolf Till Kranz,  Annette Zippelius;  We present a mode-coupling theory for the dynamics of a tagged particle in a driven granular fluid close to the glass transition. The mean-squared displacement is shown to exhibit a plateau indicating structural arrest. In contrast to elastic hard-sphere fluids, which are solely controlled by volume fraction, the localisation length as well as the critical dynamics depend on the degree of dissipation, parametrized by the coefficient of normal restitution epsilon. Hence the resulting glassy structure as well as the critical dynamics are nonuniversal with respect to epsilon. ;"Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Disordered Systems and Neural Networks (cond-mat.dis-nn); Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)"
