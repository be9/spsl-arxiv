https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0117;A diffusive logistic problem with a free boundary in time-periodic  environment: favorable habitat or unfavorable habitat; Qiaoling Chen,  Fengquan Li,  Feng Wang;"  We study the diffusive logistic equation with a free boundary in timeperiodic environment. To understand the effect of the dispersal rate $d$, the original habitat radius $h_0$, the spreading capability $\mu$, and the initial density $u_0$ on the dynamics of the problem, we divide the time-periodic habitat into two cases: favorable habitat and unfavorable habitat. By choosing $d$, $h_0$, $\mu$ and $u_0$ as variable parameters, we obtain a spreading-vanishing dichotomy and sharp criteria for the spreading and vanishing in time-periodic environment. We introduce the principal eigenvalue $\lambda_1(d, \alpha, \gamma, h(t), T)$ to determine the spreading and vanishing of the invasive species. We prove that if $\lambda_1(d, \alpha, \gamma, h_0, T)\leq 0$, the spreading must happen; while if $\lambda_1(d, \alpha, \gamma, h_0, T)> 0$, the spreading is also possible. Our results show that the species in the favorable habitat can establish itself if the dispersal rate is slow or the occupying habitat is large. In an unfavorable habitat, the species vanishes if the initial density of the species is small, while survive successfully if the initial value is big. Moreover, when spreading occurs, the asymptotic spreading speed of the free boundary is determined. ";Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0146;Estimates for radial solutions of the homogeneous Landau equation with  Coulomb potential; Maria Gualdani,  Nestor Guillen;  Motivated by the question of existence of global solutions, we obtain pointwise upper bounds for radially symmetric and monotone solutions to the homogeneous Landau equation with Coulomb potential. The estimates say that blow up in the $L^\infty$-norm at a finite time $T$ can occur only if the $L^{3/2}$-norm of the solution concentrates for times close to $T$. The bounds are obtained using the comparison principle for the Landau equation and for the associated mass function. This method provides long-time existence results for the isotropic version of the Landau equation with Coulomb potential, recently introduced by Krieger and Strain. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0185;Sharp regularity properties for the non-cutoff spatially homogeneous  Boltzmann equation; Leo Glangetas (LMRS),  Hao-Guang Li,  Chao-Jiang Xu (LMRS);  In this work, we study the Cauchy problem for the spatially homogeneous non-cutoff Boltzamnn equation with Maxwellian molecules. We prove that this Cauchy problem enjoys Gelfand-Shilov regularizing effect, that means the smoothing properties is same as the Cauchy problem defined by the evolution equation associated to a fractional harmonic oscillator. The power of this fractional is exactly the singular index of non-cutoff collisional kernel of Boltzmann operator. So that we get the regularity of solution in the Gevery class with the sharp power and the optimal exponential decay of solutions. We also give a method to construct the solution of the nonlinear Boltzmann equation by solving an infinite ``triangular'' systems of ordinary differential equations.The key tools is the spectral decomposition of linear and non-linear Boltzmann operators. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

Assume such $V$ to be small in $L^\infty(0,\infty; L^{n,\infty})$, where $L^{n,\infty}$ denotes the weak-$L^n$ space. The energy stability of this basic flow $V$ with respect to any initial disturbance in $L^2_\sigma$ has been established by Karch, Pilarczyk and Schonbek. In this paper we study, under reasonable conditions, the algebraic rates of energy decay of disturbances as $t\to\infty$. ";Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0275;Boundary regularity for the fractional heat equation; Xavier Fernández-Real,  Xavier Ros-Oton;  We study the regularity up to the boundary of solutions to fractional heat equation in bounded $C^{1,1}$ domains. More precisely, we consider solutions to $\partial_t u + (-\Delta)^s u=0 \textrm{ in }\Omega,\ t > 0$, with zero Dirichlet conditions in $\mathbb{R}^n\setminus \Omega$ and with initial data $u_0\in L^2(\Omega)$. Using the results of the second author and Serra for the elliptic problem, we show that for all $t>0$ we have $u(\cdot, t)\in C^s(\mathbb{R}^n)$ and $u(\cdot, t)/\delta^s \in C^{s-\epsilon}(\overline\Omega)$ for any $\epsilon > 0$ and $\delta(x) = \textrm{dist}(x,\partial\Omega)$. Our regularity results apply not only to the fractional Laplacian but also to more general integro-differential operators, namely those corresponding to stable L\'evy processes. As a consequence of our results, we show that solutions to the fractional heat equation satisfy a Pohozaev-type identity for positive times. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

Assuming that the unknown Neumann (Dirichlet) boundary value tends for large $t$ to a periodic function $g_1^b(t)$ ($g_0^b(t)$), we derive an easily verifiable condition that the functions $g_0^b(t)$ and $g_1^b(t)$ must satisfy. Furthermore, we introduce two different methods, one based on the formulation of a Riemann-Hilbert problem, and one based on a perturbative approach, for constructing $g_1^b(t)$ ($g_0^b(t)$) in terms of $g_0^b(t)$ ($g_1^b(t)$).

Fokas;"  We consider the nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation on the half-line with a given Dirichlet boundary datum which for large $t$ tends to a periodic function. We assume that this function is sufficiently small, namely that it can be expressed in the form $\alpha g_0^b(t)$, where $\alpha$ is a small constant. Assuming that the Neumann boundary value tends for large $t$ to the periodic function $g_1^b(t)$, we show that $g_1^b(t)$ can be expressed in terms of a perturbation series in $\alpha$ which can be constructed explicitly to any desired order. As an illustration, we compute $g_1^b(t)$ to order $\alpha^8$ for the particular case that $g_0^b(t)$ is the sum of two exponentials. We also show that there exist particular functions $g_0^b(t)$ for which the above series can be summed up, and therefore for these functions $g_1^b(t)$ can be obtained in closed form. The simplest such function is $\exp(i\omega t)$, where $\omega$ is a real constant. ";"Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI)"

We show that if a complex function $F$ on $\C$ operates in the modulation spaces $M^{p,1}(\R^n)$ by composition, then $F$ is real analytic on $\R^2 \approx \C$. This answers negatively, the open question posed in [M. Ruzhansky, M. Sugimoto, B. Wang, Modulation Spaces and Nonlinear Evolution Equations, arXiv:1203.4651], regarding the general power type nonlinearity of the form $|u|^\alpha u$. We also characterise the functions that operate in the modulation space $M^{1,1}(\R^n)$. The local well-posedness of the NLS, NLW and NLKG equations for the `real entire' nonlinearities are also studied in some weighted modulation spaces $M^{p,q}_s(\R^n)$. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

When scales are taken into account and second moments fixed accordingly, deficit functionals provide explicit stability measurements, i.e., bound with explicit constants distances to the manifold of optimal functions. Various results are obtained for the Gaussian logarithmic Sobolev inequality and its Euclidean counterpart, for the Gaussian generalized Poincar{\'e} inequalities and for the Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequalities. As a consequence, faster convergence rates in diffusion equations (fast diffusion, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck and porous medium equations) are obtained. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

The regularity of the distributions forming these spaces are characterized by a real number and an arbitrary function that varies slowly at infinity in the sense of Karamata. For the generalized solutions to the problem, we prove theorems on a priori estimates and local regularity in these scales.

In the current paper (the first part of a series of two) some preliminary steps are made, namely, the diffraction problem is reduced to two matrix Riemann-Hilbert problems with exponential growth of unknown functions (for the symmetrical part and for the antisymmetrical part). For this, the Wiener--Hopf problems are formulated, they are reduced to auxiliary functional problems by applying the embedding formula, and finally the Riemann-Hilbert problems are formulated by applying the Hurd's method. In the second part the Riemann-Hilbert problems will be solved by a novel method of OE-equation. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0582;Diffraction by an impedance strip II. Solving Riemann-Hilbert problems  by OE-equation method; Andrey V. Shanin,  Andrey I. Korolkov;  The current paper is the second part of a series of two papers dedicated to 2D problem of diffraction of acoustic waves by a segment bearing impedance boundary conditions. In the first part some preliminary steps were made, namely, the problem was reduced to two matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem. Here the Riemann-Hilbert problems are solved with the help of a novel method of OE-equations. Each Riemann-Hilbert problem is embedded into a family of similar problems with the same coefficient and growth condition, but with some other cuts. The family is indexed by an artificial parameter. It is proven that the dependence of the solution on this parameter can be described by a simple ordinary differential equation (ODE1). The boundary conditions for this equation are known and the inverse problem of reconstruction of the coefficient of ODE1 from the boundary conditions is formulated. This problem is called the OE-equation. The OE-equation is solved by a simple numerical algorithm. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

In this modeling the unknown is the couple of the distribution laws of the freely diffusing proteins and of the fixed ones. Under sufficient conditions on the aggregation and unbinding probabilities, we prove the existence of solution of the considered system, as well as their positivity, boundedness and uniqueness. Moreover, we discuss the stability of the equilibrium solution. Finally, we show that the simpler and particular choice of an affine aggregation function and of a constant unbinding probability do not lead to pattern formation as expected in the application. These analytical results are also supported by some numerical simulation. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

This result is due to a work of Bucur and Fragal\`a in 2014. In this note, we address the stability of their result in terms of the $L^1$ distance between sets. Furthermore, we provide a stability inequality in terms of the Hausdorff distance between the boundaries of sets in the class of polygons having uniformly bounded diameter.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0731;Asymptotic behavior for a one-dimensional nonlocal diffusion equation in  exterior domains; Carmen Cortázar,  Manuel Elgueta,  Fernando Quirós,  Noemi Wolanski;  We study the long time behavior of solutions to the nonlocal diffusion equation $\partial_t u=J*u-u$ in an exterior one-dimensional domain, with zero Dirichlet data on the complement. In the far field scale, $\xi_1\le|x|t^{-1/2}\le\xi_2$, $\xi_1,\xi_2>0$, this behavior is given by a multiple of the dipole solution for the local heat equation with a diffusivity determined by $J$. However, the proportionality constant is not the same on $\mathbb{R}_+$ and $\mathbb{R}_-$: it is given by the asymptotic first momentum of the solution on the corresponding half line, which can be computed in terms of the initial data. In the near field scale, $|x|\le t^{1/2}h(t)$, $\lim_{t\to\infty}h(t)=0$, the solution scaled by a factor $t^{3/2}/(|x|+1)$ converges to a stationary solution of the problem that behaves as $b^\pm{x}$ as $x\to\pm\infty$. The constants $b^\pm$ are obtained through a matching procedure with the far field limit. In the very far field, $|x|{\ge}t^{1/2} g(t)$, $g(t)\to\infty$, the solution has order $o(t^{-1})$. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0785;Location and size estimation of small rigid bodies using elastic  far-fields; Fadhel Al-Musallam,  Durga Prasad Challa,  Mourad Sini;  We are concerned with the linearized, isotropic and homogeneous elastic scattering problem by (possibly many) small rigid obstacles of arbitrary Lipschitz regular shapes in 3D. Based on the Foldy-Lax approximation, valid under a sufficient condition on the number of the obstacles, the size and the minimum distance between them, we show that any of the two body waves, namely the pressure waves P or the shear waves S, is enough for solving the inverse problem of detecting these scatterers and estimating their sizes. Further, it is also shown that the shear-horizontal part SH or the shear vertical part SV of the shear waves S are also enough for the location detection and the size estimation. Under some extra assumption on the scatterers, as the convexity assumption, we derive finer size estimates as the radius of the largest ball contained in each scatterer and the one of the smallest ball containing it. The two estimates measure, respectively, the thickness and length of each obstacle. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0907;Persistence versus extinction under a climate change in mixed  environments; Hoang-Hung Vo;  This paper is devoted to the study of the persistence versus extinction of species in the reaction-diffusion equation: \begin{equation} u_t-\Delta u=f(t,x_1-ct,y,u) \quad\quad t>0,\ x\in\Omega,\nonumber \end{equation} where $\Omega$ is of cylindrical type or partially periodic domain, $f$ is of Fisher-KPP type and the scalar $c>0$ is a given forced speed. This type of equation originally comes from a model in population dynamics (see \cite{BDNZ},\cite{PL},\cite{SK}) to study the impact of climate change on the persistence versus extinction of species. From these works, we know that the dynamics is governed by the traveling fronts $u(t,x_1,y)=U(x_1-ct,y)$, thus characterizing the set of traveling fronts plays a major role. In this paper, we first consider a more general model than the model of \cite{BDNZ} in higher dimensional space, where the environment is only assumed to be globally unfavorable with favorable pockets extending to infinity. We consider in two frameworks: the reaction term is time-independent or time-periodic dependent. For the latter, we study the concentration of the species when the environment outside $\Omega$ becomes extremely unfavorable and further prove a symmetry breaking property of the fronts. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

We use this result to study the global determination of the spacetime $(M,g)$ when it has a real-analytic structure or is stationary and satisfies the Einstein-scalar field equations.

When a shock hits an obstacle, or a flying body meets a shock, shock reflection/diffraction phenomena occur. In this paper, we show how several longstanding shock reflection/diffraction problems can be formulated as free boundary problems, discuss some recent progress in developing mathematical ideas, approaches, and techniques for solving these problems, and present some further open problems in this direction. In particular, these shock problems include von Neumann's problem for shock reflection-diffraction by two-dimensional wedges with concave corner, Lighthill's problem for shock diffraction by two-dimensional wedges with convex corner, and Prandtl-Meyer's problem for supersonic flow impinging onto solid wedges, which are also fundamental in the mathematical theory of multidimensional conservation laws. ;"Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.1537;Global uniqueness theorems for linear and nonlinear waves; Spyros Alexakis,  Arick Shao;"  We prove a unique continuation from infinity theorem for regular waves of the form $[ \Box + \mathcal{V} (t, x) ]\phi=0$. Under the assumption of no incoming and no outgoing radiation on specific halves of past and future null infinities, we show that the solution must vanish everywhere. The ""no radiation"" assumption is captured in a specific, finite rate of decay which in general depends on the $L^\infty$-profile of the potential $\mathcal{V}$. We show that the result is optimal in many regards. These results are then extended to certain power-law type nonlinear wave equations, where the order of decay one must assume is independent of the size of the nonlinear term. These results are obtained using a new family of global Carleman-type estimates on the exterior of a null cone. A companion paper to this one explores further applications of these new estimates to such nonlinear waves. ";Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

A first approach is to generalize the integral definition using the Wigner function. The symbol is then a function defined on $B^2$ and belonging to a $L^1$ space for a gaussian measure, the Weyl operator is defined as a quadratic form on a dense subspace of $L^2(B)$. For example, the symbol can be the stochastic extension on $B^2$, in the sense of L. Gross, of a function $F$ which is continuous and bounded on $H^2$. In the second approach, this function $F$ defined on $H^2$ satisfies differentiability conditions analogous to the finite dimensional ones. One needs to introduce hybrid operators acting as Weyl operators on the variables of finite dimensional subset of $H$ and as Anti-Wick operators on the rest of the variables. The final Weyl operator is then defined as a limit and it is continuous on a $L^2$ space. Under rather weak conditions, it is an extension of the operator defined by the first approach. We give examples of monomial symbols linking this construction to the classical pseudodifferential operators theory and other examples related to other fields or previous works on this subject. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.1624;On some linear parabolic PDEs on moving hypersurfaces; Amal Alphonse,  Charles M. Elliott,  Björn Stinner;  We consider existence and uniqueness for several examples of linear parabolic equations formulated on moving hypersurfaces. Specifically, we study in turn a surface heat equation, an equation posed on a bulk domain, a novel coupled bulk-surface system and an equation with a dynamic boundary condition. In order to prove the well-posedness, we make use of an abstract framework presented in a recent work by the authors which dealt with the formulation and well-posedness of linear parabolic equations on arbitrary evolving Hilbert spaces. Here, after recalling all of the necessary concepts and theorems, we show that the abstract framework can applied to the case of evolving (or moving) hypersurfaces, and then we demonstrate the utility of the framework to the aforementioned problems. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

Moreover, if the initial data is radially symmetric we can improve the above result to $m\ge 0$ and $s>0$, which is almost optimal, in the sense that $L^2(\mathbb R^{3})$ is the critical space for the equation. The main ingredients in the proof are certain endpoint Strichartz estimates, $L^2(\mathbb R^{1+3})$ bilinear estimates for free waves and the application of the $U^p$ and $V^p$ function spaces. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

We show deformation lens rigidity for a large class of manifolds which includes all manifolds with negative curvature and strictly convex boundary, possibly with non-trivial topology and trapped geodesics. For the same class of manifolds in dimension $2$, we prove that the set of endpoints and exit vectors of geodesics (ie. the scattering data) determines the topology and the conformal class of the surface. ;"Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Differential Geometry (math.DG); Dynamical Systems (math.DS)"

In this paper, we exam the weak coupling limit of quantum N-particle dynamics. We assume the integral of the microscopic interaction is zero and we assume W^{4,1} per-particle regularity on the coressponding BBGKY sequence so that we can rigorously commute limits and integrals. We prove that, if the BBGKY sequence does converge in some weak sense, then this weak-coupling limit must satisfy the infinite quantum Maxwell-Boltzmann hierarchy instead of the expected infinite Uehling-Uhlenbeck hierarchy, regardless of the statistics the particles obey. Our result indicates that, in order to derive the Uehling-Uhlenbeck equation, one must work with per-particle regularity bound below W^{4,1}. ;"Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)"

Going back to Maxwell and Langmuir, the existence of a spherical solution for which evaporating drops collapse to a point in a self-similar manner is well established in the physical literature. The diameter of the drop follows the so-called $D^{2}$ law: the second power of the drop-diameter decays linearly in time. In this study we provide a complete mathematical proof of this classical law. We prove that evaporating drops which are initially small perturbations of a sphere collapse to a point and the shape of the drop converges to a self-similar ellipsoid whose center, orientation, and semi-axes are determined by the initial shape. ;"Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)"

In the case when the equation is also coupled with a dynamic boundary condition, including the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the boundary, the total mass on the inside of the domain and its trace on the boundary should be conserved. The new issue of this paper is the setting of a mass constraint on the boundary. The effect of this additional constraint is the appearance of a Lagrange multiplier; in fact, two Lagrange multipliers arise, one for the bulk, the other for the boundary. The well-posedness of the resulting Cahn-Hilliard system with dynamic boundary condition and mass constraint on the boundary is obtained. The theory of evolution equations governed by subdifferentials is exploited and a complete characterization of the solution is given. ";Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

These conditions are formulated in algebraic form. They describe relation between the geometry of the invariant convex body and the coefficients of the system. Next, necessary conditions, which are also sufficient, for the invariance of some convex bodies are found for elliptic homogeneous systems with constant coefficients in a half-space. The necessary conditions are derived by using a criterion on the invariance of convex bodies for normalized matrix-valued integral transforms also obtained in the paper. In contrast with the previous studies of invariant sets for elliptic systems no a priori restrictions on the coefficient matrices are imposed. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

When the two spheres get closer, the electric field have a much larger magnitude compared to the external field in the small gap region between the two spheres. The enhanced field can be arbitrary large with the generic blow-up rate $|\epsilon\ln\epsilon|^{-1}$ in three dimensional space, where $\epsilon$ is the distance between the spheres. In this paper we derive rigorously an asymptotic formula of the electric field consisting of elementary functions. The asymptotic formula explicitly characterizes superfocusing of the electric field in terms of the spheres radii, the distance between the spheres, and the external field. We illustrate our results with numerical calculations. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

This is motivated by the regularity of the vector field in the Vlasov-Poisson equation with measure density. The proof exploits an anisotropic variant of the argument of Crippa and De Lellis and suitable estimates for the difference quotients in such anisotropic context. In contrast to regularization methods, this approach gives quantitative estimates in terms of the given regularity bounds. From such estimates it is possible to recover the well posedness for the ordinary differential equation and for Lagrangian solutions to the continuity and transport equations. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

If $d\ge2$, then not all the persisted tori are linearly stable, and we construct explicit examples of partially hyperbolic invariant tori. The unstable invariant tori, situated in the vicinity of the origin, create around them some local instabilities, in agreement with the popular belief in nonlinear physics that small-amplitude solutions of space-multidimensonal hamiltonian PDEs behave in a chaotic way. The proof uses an abstract KAM theorem from another our publication. ";Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

Both of linear stability and nonlinear stability are considered. This criterion shows that the monotonic shear flow is linear stable for the three dimensional Prandtl equations if and only if the tangential velocity field direction is invariant with respect to the normal variable, and this result is an exact complement to our recent work \cite{LWY} on the well-posedness theory for the three dimensional Prandtl equations with special structure. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.3058;On the formation of shocks for quasilinear wave equations; Shuang Miao,  Pin Yu;"  The paper is devoted to the study of shock formation of the 3-dimensional quasilinear wave equation \begin{equation}\label{Main Equation} - \big(1+3G^{\prime\prime}(0) (\partial_t\phi)^2\big)\partial^2_t \phi +\Delta\phi=0,\tag{\textbf{$\star$}} \end{equation} where $G^{\prime\prime}(0)$ is a non-zero constant. We will exhibit a family of smooth initial data and show that the foliation of the incoming characteristic hypersurfaces collapses. Similar to 1-dimensional conservational laws, we refer this specific type breakdown of smooth solutions as shock formation. Since $(\star)$ satisfies the classical null condition, it admits global smooth solutions for small data. Therefore, we will work with large data (in energy norm). Moreover, no symmetry condition is imposed on the initial datum. We emphasize the geometric perspectives of shock formations in the proof. More specifically, the key idea is to study the interplay between the following two objects: (1) the energy estimates of the linearized equations of $(\star)$; (2) the differential geometry of the Lorentzian metric $g=-\dfrac{1}{\left(1+3G^{\prime\prime}(0) (\partial_t\phi)^2\right)} d t^2+dx_1^2+dx_2^2+dx_3^2$. Indeed, the study of the characteristic hypersurfaces (implies shock formation) is the study of the null hypersurfaces of $g$. The techniques in the proof are inspired by the work \cite{Ch-Shocks} in which the formation of shocks for $3$-dimensional relativistic compressible Euler equations with small initial data is established. We also use the short pulse method which is introduced in the study of formation of black holes in general relativity in \cite{Ch-BlackHoles} and generalized in \cite{K-R-09}.

We obtain, if the interaction potential is sufficiently convex far away from the origin, that the support of the solution is uniformly bounded. Under a suitable Lipschitz condition for the potential, we can exclude finite-time blow-up and give a partial characterization of the long-time behaviour. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.3371;Qualitative studies of advective competition system with  Beddington-DeAngelis functional response; Ling Jin,  Qi Wang,  Zengyan Zhang;  This paper investigates a reaction-advection-diffusion system modeling interspecific competition between two species over bounded domains. The kinetic terms are assumed to satisfy the Beddington-DeAngelis functional responses. We consider the situation that first species disperse by a combination of random walk and directed movement along the population density of the second species which disperse randomly within the habitat. For multi-dimensional bounded domains, we prove the global existence and boundedness of time-dependent solutions. For one-dimensional finite domains, we study the effect of diffusion and advection on the existence and stability of nonconstant positive steady states to the strongly coupled elliptic system. In particular, our stability result of these nontrivial steady states provides a selection mechanism for stable wavemodes of the time-dependent system. In the limit of diffusion rates, we show that the steady states of this full elliptic system can be approximated by nonconstant positive solutions of a shadow system and then we construct boundary spike solutions to this shadow system. For the full elliptic system, we also investigate solutions with a single boundary spike or an inverted boundary spike, i.e., the first species concentrate on the boundary point while the second species dominate the whole habitat except the boundary point. These spatial structures can be used to model the spatial segregation phenomenon through interspecific competitions. Some numerical studies are performed to illustrate and support our theoretical findings. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

The existence of classical solutions is limited to dimensions $d\leq 3$ under strong assumptions on the initial data, while weak solutions are known to exist under milder conditions. However, in the setting of weak solutions it is unclear whether the Eulerian description provided by the equation physically corresponds to a Lagrangian evolution of the particles. In this paper we develop several general tools concerning the Lagrangian structure of transport equations with non-smooth vector fields and we apply these results: (1) to show that weak solutions of Vlasov-Poisson are Lagrangian; (2) to obtain global existence of weak solutions under minimal assumptions on the initial data.

Such nonlocal operators $L$ depend on a finite measure on $S^{n-1}$, called the spectral measure. First, we study the interior regularity of solutions to $Lu=f$ in $B_1$. We prove that if $f$ is $C^\alpha$ then $u$ belong to $C^{\alpha+2s}$ whenever $\alpha+2s$ is not an integer. In case $f\in L^\infty$, we show that the solution $u$ is $C^{2s}$ when $s\neq1/2$, and $C^{2s-\epsilon}$ for all $\epsilon>0$ when $s=1/2$. Then, we study the boundary regularity of solutions to $Lu=f$ in $\Omega$, $u=0$ in $\mathbb R^n\setminus\Omega$, in $C^{1,1}$ domains $\Omega$. We show that solutions $u$ satisfy $u/d^s\in C^{s-\epsilon}(\overline\Omega)$ for all $\epsilon>0$, where $d$ is the distance to $\partial\Omega$.

The first direction is taking into account medium amplitude topography variations and the second direction is allowing strong nonlinearity using a new pseudo-symmetrizer, thus canceling out the smallness assumptions of the Camassa-Holm regime for the well-posedness and stability results. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

More precisely, we consider an n-dimensional asymptotically hyperbolic Riemannian manifold $(M,\tilde g)$ such that the conformally rescaled metric $x^2 \tilde g$ (with $x$ a boundary defining function) extends to the closure $\bar M$ of $M$ as a metric of class $C^{n-1}$ which is also polyhomogeneous of class $C^{p}$ on $\bar M$. Likewise we assume that the conformally rescaled symmetric (0,2)-tensor $x^{2}K$ extends to the closure as a tensor field of class $C^{n-1}$ which is polyhomogeneous of class $C^{p-1}$. We assume that the initial data $(\tilde g, K)$ satisfy the Einstein constraint equations and also that the boundary datum is of class $C^p$ on $\partial M\times (-T_0,T_0)$ and satisfies a set of natural compatibility conditions with the initial data.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.4427;Resolvent and spectral measure on non-trapping asymptotically hyperbolic  manifolds II: spectral measure, restriction theorem, spectral multiplier; Xi Chen,  Andrew Hassell;  We consider the Laplacian $\Delta$ on an asymptotically hyperbolic manifold $X$, as defined by Mazzeo and Melrose. We give pointwise bounds on the spectral measure for the operator $(\Delta - n^2/4)_+^{1/2}$ on such manifolds, under the assumptions that $X$ is nontrapping and there is no resonance at the bottom of the spectrum. This uses the construction of the resolvent given by Mazzeo and Melrose (valid when the spectral parameter lies in a compact set), Melrose, S\'a Barreto and Vasy (high energy estimates for a perturbation of the hyperbolic metric) and the present authors (see also the work by Yiran Wang) in the general high-energy case. Under the additional assumption that $X$ has negative curvature everywhere, we give two applications of the spectral measure estimates. The first, following work due to Guillarmou and Sikora with the second author in the asymptotically conic case, is a restriction theorem, that is, a $L^p(X) \to L^{p'}(X)$ operator norm bound on the spectral measure. The second is a spectral multiplier result, that is, a bound on functions $F((\Delta - n^2/4)_+^{1/2})$ of the square root of the Laplacian, in terms of norms of the function $F$. Compared to the asymptotically conic case, our spectral multiplier result is weaker, but the restriction estimate is stronger. In both cases, the difference can be traced to the exponential volume growth at infinity for asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds, as opposed to polynomial growth in the asymptotically conic setting. The pointwise bounds on the spectral measure established here will also be applied to Strichartz estimates in another work by the first author. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

Previous modeling efforts include RD population models with respect to one-dimensional unbounded domain, unbounded strip and rectangular spatial domain. However, the importance of an RD model in a symmetrical domain lies in the increasing number of empirical studies conducted with respect to symmetrical natural habitats of single species. Assuming that the single species has no directional preference to spread in the symmetrical domain, the RD model is reduced to an equation with no angular dependance. The model can be further reduced by considering the birth function in the form of the Bessel function of the first kind. We numerically simulate the reduced forms of the nonlocal delay RD model to study the dispersal and growth of behaviors of the single species in a circular domain.

We show the existence of a critical exponent $q_* < p$ such that if $p-1 < q < q_*$ there exist positive solutions of (E) with an isolated singularity on $\partial\Omega$ and that these solutions belong to two different classes of singular solutions. If $q_*\leq q < p$ no such solution exists and actually any boundary isolated singularity of a positive solution of (E) is removable. We prove that all the singular positive solutions are classified according the two types of singular solutions that we have constructed. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

Here $(-\Delta)^s_p$ denotes the fractional $p$-Laplacian and $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ is a bounded regular domain. The proof of the bifurcation results relies in computing the Leray--Schauder degree by making an homotopy respect to $s$ (the order of the fractional $p$-Laplacian) and then to use results of local case (that is $s=1$) found in [17]. Finally, we give some application to an existence result. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

We are interested in upper bounds on the Nusselt number $\mathrm{Nu}$, the upwards heat transport, in terms of the Rayleigh number $\mathrm{Ra}$, that characterizes the relative strength of the driving mechanism and the Prandtl number $\mathrm{Pr}$, that characterizes the strength of the inertial effects. We show that, up to logarithmic corrections, the upper bound $\mathrm{Nu}\lesssim \mathrm{Ra}^{\frac{1}{3}}$ of Constantin and Doering in 1999 persists as long as $\mathrm{Pr}\gtrsim \mathrm{Ra}^{\frac{1}{3}}$ and then crosses over to $\mathrm{Nu}\lesssim\mathrm{Pr}^{-\frac{1}{2}}\mathrm{Ra}^{\frac{1}{2}}$. This result improves the one of Wang by going beyond the perturbative regime $\mathrm{Pr} \gg \mathrm{Ra}$. The proof uses a new way to estimate the transport nonlinearity in the Navier-Stokes equations capitalizing on the no-slip boundary condition. It relies on a new Calder\'on-Zygmund estimate for the non-stationary Stokes equations in $L^1$ with a borderline Muckenhoupt weight. ;"Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)"

We use a Nash-Moser algorithm together with a reducibility theorem on the linearized operator in a neighborhood of zero. Due to the presence of the highest order derivatives in the non-linearity the classic KAM-reducibility argument fails and one needs to use a wider class of changes of variables such has diffeomorphisms of the torus and pseudo-differential operators. This procedure automtically produces a change of variables, well defined on the phase space of the equation, which diagonalizes the operator linearized at the solution. This gives the linear stability. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6138;A smooth global model for scattering in layered media; Peter C. Gibson;"  Layered media have been studied extensively both for their importance in imaging technologies and as an example of a hyperbolic PDE with discontinuous coefficients. From the perspective of acoustic imaging, the time limited impulse response at the boundary, or boundary Green's function, represents measured data, and the objective is to determine coefficients, which encode physical parameters, from the data. The present paper resolves two fundamental open problems for layered media: (1) how to compute the time limited Green's function in the presence of discontinuous coefficients; and (2) to determine precisely how data depends on coefficients. We show that there exists a single system of equations in $3n$-dimensional space that governs the parameterized family of all $n$-layered media simultaneously. The alternate system has smooth coefficients, can be solved directly by separation of variables, and recovers the impulse response at the boundary for the original equations. The analysis brings to light an exotic laplacian---hybrid between the euclidean and hyperbolic laplacians---that plays a central role in the scattering process. Its eigenfunctions comprise a new family of orthogonal polynomials on the disk. These serve as building blocks for a universal wavefield in terms of which the dependence of data on coefficients has a simple description: reflection data is obtained by sampling a translate of the wavefield on the integer lattice and then pushing forward by a linear functional, where the translate and pushforward correspond to reflectivity and layer depth vectors, respectively.

Furthermore, in order to construct the partition, we use Ambrosio's superposition principle \cite{ambrosiobv}. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6408;Quadratic interaction functional for general systems of conservation  laws; Stefano Bianchini,  Stefano Modena;"  For the Glimm scheme approximation $u_\epsilon$ to the solution of the system of conservation laws in one space dimension \begin{equation*} u_t + f(u)_x = 0, \qquad u(0,x) = u_0(x) \in \mathbb R^n, \end{equation*} with initial data $u_0$ with small total variation, we prove a quadratic (w.r.t. $\mathrm{TV}(u_0)$) interaction estimate, which has been used in the literature for stability and convergence results. No assumptions on the structure of the flux $f$ are made (apart smoothness), and this estimate is the natural extension of the Glimm type interaction estimate for genuinely nonlinear systems. More precisely we obtain the following results: \newline - a new analysis of the interaction estimates of simple waves; \newline - a Lagrangian representation of the derivative of the solution, i.e. a map $\mathtt x(t,w)$ which follows the trajectory of each wave $w$ from its creation to its cancellation; \newline - the introduction of the characteristic interval and partition for couples of waves, representing the common history of the two waves; \item a new functional $\mathfrak Q$ controlling the variation in speed of the waves w.r.t. time. \newline This last functional is the natural extension of the Glimm functional for genuinely nonlinear systems. The main result is that the distribution $D_{tt} \mathtt x(t,w)$ is a measure with total mass $\leq \mathrm{const} \mathrm{TV}(u_0)^2$. ";Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6587;Approximation of 2D Euler Equations by the Second-Grade Fluid Equations  with Dirichlet Boundary Conditions; Milton C. Lopes Filho,  Helena J. Nussenzveig Lopes,  Edriss S. Titi,  Aibin Zang;  The second-grade fluid equations are a model for viscoelastic fluids, with two parameters: $\alpha > 0$, corresponding to the elastic response, and $\nu > 0$, corresponding to viscosity. Formally setting these parameters to $0$ reduces the equations to the incompressible Euler equations of ideal fluid flow. In this article we study the limits $\alpha, \nu \to 0$ of solutions of the second-grade fluid system, in a smooth, bounded, two-dimensional domain with no-slip boundary conditions. This class of problems interpolates between the Euler-$\alpha$ model ($\nu = 0$), for which the authors recently proved convergence to the solution of the incompressible Euler equations, and the Navier-Stokes case ($\alpha = 0$), for which the vanishing viscosity limit is an important open problem. We prove three results. First, we establish convergence of the solutions of the second-grade model to those of the Euler equations provided $\nu = \mathcal{O}(\alpha^2)$, as $\alpha \to 0$, extending the main result in [19]. Second, we prove equivalence between convergence (of the second-grade fluid equations to the Euler equations) and vanishing of the energy dissipation in a suitably thin region near the boundary, in the asymptotic regime $\nu = \mathcal{O}(\alpha^{6/5})$, $\nu/\alpha^2 \to \infty$ as $\alpha \to 0$. This amounts to a convergence criterion similar to the well-known Kato criterion for the vanishing viscosity limit of the Navier-Stokes equations to the Euler equations. Finally, we obtain an extension of Kato's classical criterion to the second-grade fluid model, valid if $\alpha = \mathcal{O}(\nu^{3/2})$, as $\nu \to 0$. The proof of all these results relies on energy estimates and boundary correctors, following the original idea by Kato. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6643;Localized concentration of semi-classical states for nonlinear Dirac  equations; Yanheng Ding,  Tian Xu;"  The present paper studies concentration phenomena of semiclassical approximation of a massive Dirac equation with general nonlinear self-coupling: \[ -i\hbar\alpha\cdot\nabla w+a\beta w+V(x)w=g(|w|)w \,. \] Compared with some existing issues, the most interesting results obtained here are twofold: the solutions concentrating around local minima of the external potential; and the nonlinearities assumed to be either super-linear or asymptotically linear at the infinity. As a consequence one sees that, if there are $k$ bounded domains $\Lambda_j\subset\mathbb{R}^3$ such that $-a<\min_{\Lambda_j} V=V(x_j)<\min_{\partial\Lambda_j}V$, $x_j\in\Lambda_j$, then the $k$-families of solutions $w_\hbar^j$ concentrates around $x_j$ as $\hbar\to 0$, respectively. The proof relies on variational arguments: the solutions are found as critical points of an energy functional. The Dirac operator has a continuous spectrum which is not bounded from below and above, hence the energy functional is strongly indefinite. A penalization technique is developed here to obtain the desired solutions. ";"Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)"

The first proof, which is similar to known proofs for convex Hamiltonians, invokes a Jensen-like inequality for quasiconvex functions instead of the standard Jensen's inequality. The second proof is completely different with elementary calculations. It is based on convergence of derivatives of mollified Lipschitz continuous functions whose proof is also given.

We derive bounds that restrict how this $H^1$-energy can be distributed inside such cones.

These bound the $L^{p+1}$-norm in the interior of timelike cones by their $H^1$-norm near the boundary of the cones. Such estimates can also be applied to obtain certain integrated decay estimates for globally regular solutions to such equations, in the interior of time cones. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

Our long-term goal is the solution of the inverse problem related to the detection of regions affected by heart ischemic disease, whose position and size are unknown. We model the presence of ischemic regions in the form of small inhomogeneities. This leads to the study of a boundary value problem for a semilinear elliptic equation. We first analyze the well-posedness of the problem establishing some key energy estimates. These allow us to derive rigorously an asymptotic formula of the boundary potential perturbation due to the presence of the inhomogeneities, following an approach similar to the one introduced by Capdeboscq and Vogelius in \cite{capvoge} in the case of the linear conductivity equation.

We extend the method so as to consider the shrinkage of the functional space. Roughly speaking, we consider a class of operators writing as a dissipative part plus a mild perturbation, and we prove that if the associated semigroup satisfies a decay estimate in some reference space then it satisfies the same decay estimate in another-smaller or larger-Banach space under the condition that a certain iterate of the ""mild perturba- tion"" part of the operator combined with the dissipative part of the semigroup maps the larger space to the smaller space in a bounded way. The cornerstone of our approach is a factorization argument, reminiscent of the Dyson series.(2) We apply this method to the kinetic Fokker-Planck equation when the spatial domain is either the torus with periodic boundary conditions, or the whole space with a confinement potential.

We initiate the corresponding study of higher critical points by considering a superlinear free boundary problem related to plasma confinement. The associated energy functional is nondifferentiable, and therefore standard variational methods cannot be used directly to prove the existence of critical points. Here we obtain a nontrivial generalized solution $u$ of mountain pass type as the limit of mountain pass points of a suitable sequence of $C^1$-functionals approximating the energy. We show that $u$ minimizes the energy on the associated Nehari manifold and use this fact to prove that it is nondegenerate. We use the nondegeneracy of $u$ to show that it satisfies the free boundary condition in the viscosity sense. Moreover, near any free boundary point that has a measure-theoretic normal, the free boundary is a smooth surface, and hence the free boundary condition holds in the classical sense. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

We show that there is a unique $\lambda^*$ for which the above equation has a solution $u$ with appropriate growth as $|x|\rightarrow \infty$. Moreover, associated to $\lambda^*$ is a convex solution $u^*$ that has bounded second derivatives, provided $F$ is uniformly elliptic and $H$ is uniformly convex. It is unknown whether or not $u^*$ is unique up to an additive constant; however, we verify this is the case when $n=1$ or when $F, f,H$ are ""rotational."" ";Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.8151;Mathematical Validity of the f(R) Theory of Modified Gravity; Philippe G. LeFloch,  Yue Ma;  We establish a well-posedness theory for the f(R) theory of modified gravity, which is a generalization of Einstein's theory of gravitation. The scalar curvature R of the spacetime, which arises in the integrand of the Einstein-Hilbert functional, is replaced by a function f=f(R). The field equations involve up to fourth-order derivatives of the spacetime metric, and the challenge is to understand the structure of these high-order terms. We propose a formulation of the initial value problem in modified gravity when the initial data are prescribed on a hypersurface. In addition to the induced metric and second fundamental form of the initial slice and the initial matter content, an initial data set must also provide the spacetime scalar curvature and its time-derivative. We introduce an augmented conformal formulation, as we call it, in which the spacetime curvature is an independent variable. In the so-called wave gauge, the field equations of modified gravity reduce a coupled system of nonlinear wave-Klein-Gordon equations with defocusing potential, whose unknowns are the conformally-transformed metric and the scalar curvature, as well as the matter fields. We are able to establish the existence of maximal globally hyperbolic developments when the matter is represented by a scalar field. We analyze the so-called Jordan coupling and work with the Einstein metric, which is conformally equivalent to the physical metric --the conformal factor depending upon the scalar curvature. Our analysis leads us to a rigorous validation of the theory of modified gravity. We derive quantitative estimates, which are uniform in terms of the nonlinearity f(R), and we prove that asymptotically flat spacetimes of modified gravity are `close' to Einstein spacetimes, when the function f(R) in the action functional of modified gravity is `close' to the Einstein-Hilbert integrand R. ;"Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)"

In particular, we consider the problem $$(P_\theta)\quad \left\{ \begin{array}{rcl} u_t+(-\Delta)^{s} u&=&\l\dfrac{\,u}{|x|^{2s}}+\theta u^p+ c f\mbox{ in } \Omega\times (0,T),\\ u(x,t)&>&0\inn \Omega\times (0,T),\\ u(x,t)&=&0\inn (\ren\setminus\Omega)\times[ 0,T),\\ u(x,0)&=&u_0(x) \mbox{ if }x\in\O, \end{array} \right. $$ where $N> 2s$, $0<s<1$, $(-\Delta)^s$ is the fractional Laplacian of order $2s$, $p>1$, $c,\l>0$, $u_0\ge 0$, $f\ge 0$ are in a suitable class of functions and $\theta=\{0,1\}$. Notice that $(P_0)$ is a linear problem, while $(P_1)$ is a semilinear problem. The main features in the article are: \begin{enumerate} \item Optimal results about \emph{existence} and \emph{instantaneous and complete blow up} in the linear problem $(P_0)$, where the best constant $\Lambda_{N,s}$ in the fractional Hardy inequality provides the threshold between existence and nonexistence. Similar results in the local heat equation were obtained by Baras and Goldstein in \cite{BaGo}. However, in the fractional setting the arguments are much more involved and they require the proof of a weak Harnack inequality for a weighted operator that appear in a natural way. Once this Harnack inequality is obtained, the optimal results follow as a simpler consequence than in the classical case. \item The existence of a critical power $p_+(s,\lambda)$ in the semilinear problem $(P_1)$ such that: \begin{enumerate} \item If $p> p_+(s,\lambda)$, the problem has no weak positive supersolutions and a phenomenon of \emph{complete and instantaneous blow up} happens. \item If $p< p_+(s,\lambda)$, there exists a positive solution for a suitable class of nonnegative data. \end{enumerate} \end{enumerate} ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.8301;Upscaling nonlinear adsorption in periodic porous media - Homogenization  approach; Grégoire Allaire,  Harsha Hutridurga;  We consider the homogenization of a model of reactive flows through periodic porous media involving a single solute which can be absorbed and desorbed on the pore boundaries. This is a system of two convection-diffusion equations, one in the bulk and one on the pore boundaries, coupled by an exchange reaction term. The novelty of our work is to consider a nonlinear reaction term, a so-called Langmuir isotherm, in an asymptotic regime of strong convection. We therefore generalize previous works on a similar linear model [G. Allaire et al, Chemical Engineering Science, 65 (2010), pp.2292-2300], [G. Allaire et al, SIAM J. Math. Anal., 42 (2010), pp.125-144], [Allaire et al, IMA J Appl Math., 77 (2012), pp.788-815]. Under a technical assumption of equal drift velocities in the bulk and on the pore boundaries, we obtain a nonlinear monotone diffusion equation as the homogenized model. Our main technical tool is the method of two-scale convergence with drift [Marusic-Paloka et al, Journal of London Math. Soc., 72 (2005), pp.391-409]. We provide some numerical test cases in two space dimensions to support our theoretical analysis. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

In this paper, we proved that the topological solutions of \eqref{0.1} are uniquely determined by the location of their vortices provided the coupling parameter $\varepsilon$ is small and the collapsing velocity of vortices $p_i^\varepsilon$ is slow enough or fast enough comparing with $\varepsilon$. This extends the uniqueness results of Choe \cite{Choe2005} and Tarantello \cite{Tarantello2007}. Meanwhile, for any topological solution $\psi$ defined in $\mathbb R^2$ whose linearized operator is non-degenerate, we construct a sequence topological solutions $u_\varepsilon$ of \eqref{0.1} whose asymptotic limit is exactly $\psi$ after rescaling around $0$. A consequence is that non-uniqueness of topological solutions in $\mathbb R^2$ implies non-uniqueness of topological solutions on torus with collapsing vortices. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.8438;On global regularity and singularities of Navier-Stokes- and Euler  equation solutions; Joerg Kampen;  Euler-Leray data functions of first and second order are defined by first and second order derivatives of the nonlinear spatial part of the incompressible Euler equation operator in Leray projection form applied to Cauchy data. The Lipschitz continuity of these functions for a certain class of strongly regular Cauchy data is sufficient for the existence of global regular upper bounds of incompressible Navier Stokes equation solutions. Global regular upper bounds of global solution branches of the incompressible Euler equation can be obtained for a class of strongly regular Cauchy data, if the Cauchy data satisfy an additional condition of strong polynomial decay at spatial infinity. Furthermore, if a Lipschitz condition for the Euler- Leray data function of second order is satisfied, then there are long time vorticity blow ups of the incompressible Euler equation, and, correspondingly, short time and long time vorticity blow ups or singular solutions of incompressible Navier Stokes equations with time-dependent forces of lower regularity. A further consequence is that multiple global solutions of the incompressible Euler equations exists. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

The model has separately convex stored energy and is associative, namely the 1-homogeneous potential of dissipative force driving the delamination depends only on rates of internal parameters. An efficient fractional-step-type semi-implicit discretisation in time is shown to converge to specific, stress-driven like) local solutions that may approximately obey the maximum-dissipation principle. Making still a spatial discretisation, this convergence as well as relevancy of such solution concept are demonstrated on a nontrivial 2-dimensional example. ;"Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Numerical Analysis (math.NA)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.8685;On the Spectrum of Volume Integral Operators in Acoustic Scattering; M. Costabel (IRMAR);"  Volume integral equations have been used as a theoretical tool in scattering theory for a long time. A classical application is an existence proof for the scattering problem based on the theory of Fredholm integral equations. This approach is described for acoustic and electromagnetic scattering in the books by Colton and Kress [CoKr83, CoKr98] where volume integral equations appear under the name ""Lippmann-Schwinger equations"". In electromagnetic scattering by penetrable objects, the volume integral equation (VIE) method has also been used for numerical computations. In particular the class of discretization methods known as ""discrete dipole approximation"" [PuPe73, DrFl94] has become a standard tool in computational optics applied to atmospheric sciences, astrophysics and recently to nano-science under the keyword ""optical tweezers"", see the survey article [YuHo07] and the literature quoted there. In sharp contrast to the abundance of articles by physicists describing and analyzing applications of the VIE method, the mathematical literature on the subject consists only of a few articles. An early spectral analysis of a VIE for magnetic problems was given in [FrPa84], and more recently [Ki07, KiLe09] have found sufficient conditions for well-posedness of the VIE in electromagnetic and acoustic scattering with variable coefficients. In [CoDK10, CoDS12], we investigated the essential spectrum of the VIE in electromagnetic scattering under general conditions on the complex-valued coefficients, finding necessary and sufficient conditions for well-posedness in the sense of Fredholm in the physically relevant energy spaces. A detailed presentation of these results can be found in the thesis [Sa14]. Publications based on the thesis are in preparation. Curiously, whereas the study of VIE in electromagnetic scattering has thus been completed as far as questions of Fredholm properties are concerned, the simpler case of acoustic scattering does not seem to have been covered in the same depth. It is the purpose of the present paper to close this gap. ";"Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Numerical Analysis (math.NA)"

There is a threshold value $a_*$ which separates different behaviors of $f(\cdot,a)$: if $a>a_*$ then $f(\cdot,a)$ vanishes at least once in $(0,\infty)$ and takes negative values while $f(\cdot,a)$ is positive in $(0,\infty)$ and decays algebraically to zero as $r\to\infty$ if $a\in (0,a_*)$. At the threshold value, $f(\cdot,a_*)$ is also positive in $(0,\infty)$ but decays exponentially fast to zero as $r\to\infty$. The proof of these results relies on a transformation to a first-order ordinary differential equation and a monotonicity property with respect to $a>0$. This classification is one step in the description of the dynamics near the extinction time of a diffusive Hamilton-Jacobi equation with critical gradient absorption and fast diffusion. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

The question of the monotonicity in time is motivated by a medical imagery issue. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

We derive a functional that describes the free-energy of a collection of nearly-parallel quantized vortex filaments in a cylindrical $3$-dimensional domain, in certain scaling limits; it is shown to arise as the $\Gamma$-limit of a sequence of scaled Ginzburg-Landau functionals. Our main result establishes for the first time a long believed connection between the Ginzburg-Landau functional and the energy of nearly parallel filaments that applies to many mathematically and physically relevant situations where clustering of filaments is expected. In this setting it also constitutes a higher-order asymptotic expansion of the Ginzburg-Landau energy, a refinement over the arclength functional approximation. Our description of the vorticity region significantly improves on previous studies and enables us to rigorously distinguish a collection of multiplicity one vortex filaments from an ensemble of fewer higher multiplicity ones. As an application, we prove the existence of solutions of the Ginzburg-Landau equation that exhibit clusters of vortex filaments whose small-scale structure is governed by the limiting free-energy functional.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00871;The Dirac equation in two dimensions: Dispersive estimates and  classification of threshold obstructions; M. Burak Erdogan,  William R. Green;"  We investigate dispersive estimates for the two dimensional Dirac equation with a potential. In particular, we show that the Dirac evolution satisfies a $t^{-1}$ decay rate as an operator from the Hardy space $H^1$ to $BMO$, the space of functions of bounded mean oscillation. This estimate, along with the $L^2$ conservation law allows one to deduce a family of Strichartz estimates. We classify the structure of threshold obstructions as being composed of s-wave resonances, p-wave resonances and eigenfunctions. We show that, as in the case of the Schr\""odinger evolution, the presence of a threshold s-wave resonance does not destroy the $t^{-1}$ decay rate. As a consequence of our analysis we obtain a limiting absorption principle in the neighborhood of the threshold, and show that there are only finitely many eigenvalues in the spectral gap.

More precisely, we consider the Vlasov equation coupled to the compressible isentropic Navier-Stokes equations through a drag forcing term. For this system, the large-time behavior shows the exponential alignment between particles and fluid velocities as time evolves. This improves the previous result by Bae-Choi-Ha-Kang[Disc. Cont. Dyn.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01027;Pointwise Gradient Bounds for Degenerate Semigroups (of UFG type); Dan Crisan,  Michela Ottobre;  In this paper we consider diffusion semigroups generated by second order differential operators of degenerate type. The operators that we consider do not, in general, satisfy the Hormander condition and are not hypoelliptic. In particular, instead of working under the Hormander paradigm, we consider the so-called UFG condition, introduced by Kusuoka and Strook in the eighties. The UFG condition is weaker than the uniform Hormander condition, the smoothing effect taking place only in certain directions (rather than in every direction, as it is the case when the Hormander condition is assumed). Under the UFG condition, Kusuoka and Strook deduced sharp small time asymptotic bounds for the derivatives of the semigroup in the directions where smoothing occurs. In this paper, we study the large time asymptotics for the gradients of the diffusion semigroup in the same set of directions and under the same UFG condition. In particular, we identify conditions under which the derivatives of the diffusion semigroup in the smoothing directions decay exponentially in time. This paper constitutes therefore a stepping stone in the analysis of the long time behaviour of diffusions which do not satisfy the Hormander condition. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

Leach;  We consider the one-factor model of commodities for which the parameters of the model depend upon the stock price or on the time. For that model we study the existence of group-invariant transformations. When the parameters are constant, the one-factor model is maximally symmetric. That also holds for the time-dependent problem. However, in the case for which the parameters depend upon the stock price (space) the one-factor model looses the group invariants. For specific functional forms of the parameters the model admits other possible Lie algebras. In each case we determine the conditions which the parameters should satisfy in order for the equation to admit Lie point symmetries. Some applications are given and we show which should be the precise relation amongst the parameters of the model in order for the equation to be maximally symmetric. Finally we discuss some modifications of the initial conditions in the case of the space-dependent model. We do that by using geometric techniques. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

We develop some results about its geodesics and heat kernel associated to its sub-Laplacian and we illuminate some interesting geometric and analytic features appearing when one compares the isotropic ($\alpha_{1}=\alpha_{2}$) and the non-isotropic cases ($\alpha_{1}\neq \alpha_{2}$). In particular, we give the exact structure of the cut locus, and we get the complete small-time asymptotics for its heat kernel. ;"Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Differential Geometry (math.DG); Optimization and Control (math.OC)"

Therefore CHS is still a valid equation to recover the correct boundary condition for the interior Laplace equation over the 2D unit disk. ;"Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Numerical Analysis (math.NA)"

Evers;  We study the connection between mild and weak solutions for a class of measure-valued evolution equations on the bounded domain $[0,1]$. Mass moves, driven by a velocity field that is either a function of the spatial variable only, $v=v(x)$, or depends on the solution $\mu$ itself: $v=v[\mu](x)$. The flow is stopped at the boundaries of $[0,1]$, while mass is gated away by a certain right-hand side. In previous works [J. Differential Equations, 259 (2015), pp. 1068-1097] and [SIAM J. Math. Anal., 48 (2016), pp. 1929-1953], we showed the existence and uniqueness of appropriately defined mild solutions for $v=v(x)$ and $v=v[\mu](x)$, respectively. In the current paper we define weak solutions (by specifying the weak formulation and the space of test functions). The main result is that the aforementioned mild solutions are weak solutions, both when $v=v(x)$ and when $v=v[\mu](x)$. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

Given a non-negative and radially symmetric initial condition with a non-increasing profile which decays sufficiently fast as $|x| \to \infty$, it is shown that the corresponding solution $u$ to the above equation approaches a uniquely determined separate variable solution of the form $U(t, x) = (T_e - t)^{1/(2-p)} f_* (|x|), (t, x) \in (0, T_e) \times \mathbb{R}^N$, as $t \to T_e$, where $T_e$ denotes the finite extinction time of $u$. A cornerstone of the convergence proof is an underlying variational structure of the equation. Also, the selected profile $f_*$ is the unique non-negative solution to a second order ordinary differential equation which decays exponentially at infinity. A complete classification of solutions to this equation is provided, thereby describing all separate variable solutions of the original equation. One important difficulty in the uniqueness proof is that no monotonicity argument seems to be available and it is overcome by the construction of an appropriate Pohozaev functional. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

Infection dynamics are based on a simplified model for cross infection between mosquitoes and birds, and the free boundary is introduced to model and explore the expanding front of the infective region. The spatial-temporal risk index $R_0^F(t)$, which involves time and characters of the region, is defined for the simplified model with the free boundary to compare with other related threshold values, including the usual basic reproduction number $R_0$. Sufficient conditions for the virus to vanish or spread are given. Our results suggest that the virus will be in a scenario of vanishing if $R_0\leq 1$, and the virus will spread to the whole region if $R_{0}^F(t_0)\geq 1$ for some $t_0\geq 0$, while if $R^F_0(0)<1<R_0$, the spreading or vanishing of the virus depends on the initial numbers of infected mosquitoes and birds, the area of the infected region and diffusion rates. Moreover, some remarks on the basic reproduction numbers and the spreading speed are presented and compared. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

The coupling between the scales is done via micro-macro flux conditions. Our target system has a typical structure for reaction-diffusion-flow problems in media with distributed microstructures (also called, double porosity materials). Besides ensuring basic estimates for the convergence of two-scale semi-discrete Galerkin approximations, we provide a set of {\em a priori} feedback estimates and a local feedback error estimator that help in designing a distributed-high-errors strategy to allow for a computationally efficient zooming in and out from microscopic structures. The error control on the feedback estimates relies on two-scale-energy, regularity, and interpolation estimates as well as on a fine bookeeping of the sources responsible with the propagation of the (multiscale) approximation errors. The working technique based on {\em a priori } feedback estimates is in principle applicable to a large class of systems of PDEs with dual structure admitting strong solutions. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

The surfactants dynamics couple to the fluid dynamics by adjusting the surface tension coefficient on the interface and also through tangential Marangoni stresses caused by gradients in surfactant concentration. We prove that small perturbations of equilibria give rise to global-in-time solutions in an appropriate functional space, and we prove that the solutions return to equilibrium exponentially fast. In particular this proves the asymptotic stability of equilibria. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03251;On the determination of sets supporting unknown sources for the wave  equation from radiated fields; Armin Lechleiter;  Given near or far field wave measurements generated by some unknown time- and space-dependent acoustic source, we seek to rapidly determine a domain in space-time, as small as possible, that contains the support of a source radiating these measurements. As for any inverse source problem, this task is challenging without further restrictions on the source, particularly due to the infinite-dimensional space of silent sources radiating zero measurements. This first causes non-uniqueness, that is, the source in general cannot be determined uniquely, and second prevents the computation of, e. g., a largest set that must contain the support of the source. To determine small domains containing the support of some source that radiates given measurements, we exploit that solutions to the wave equation propagate along characteristics. We further indicate restrictions on the support of a source that allow to theoretically characterize this support uniquely from near or far field measurements. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

As for the classic Energetic approach, solutions can be obtained by solving a modified time Incremental Minimization Scheme, where at each step the dissipation (quasi-)distance $\mathsf d$ is incremented by a viscous correction $\delta$ (e.g.~proportional to the square of the distance $\mathsf d$), which penalizes far distance jumps by inducing a localized version of the stability condition. We prove a general convergence result and a typical characterization by Stability and Energy Balance in a setting comparable to the standard energetic one, thus capable to cover a wide range of applications. The new refined Energy Balance condition compensates the localized stability and provides a careful description of the jump behavior: at every jump the solution follows an optimal transition, which resembles in a suitable variational sense the discrete scheme that has been implemented for the whole construction. ;"Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Dynamical Systems (math.DS); Optimization and Control (math.OC)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03404;On the homogenization of a new class of locally periodic microstructures  in linear elasticity with residual stress; Brian Seguin;  Many biological and engineering materials have nonperiodic microstructures for which classical periodic homogenization results do not apply. Certain nonperiodic microstructures may be approximated by locally periodic microstructures for which homogenization techniques are available. Motivated by the consideration that such materials are often anisotropic and can posses residual stresses, a broad class of locally periodic microstructures is considered and the resulting effective macroscopic equations are derived. The effective residual stress and effective elasticity tensor are determined by solving unit cell problems at each point in the domain. However, it is found that for a certain class of locally periodic microstructures, solving the unit cell problems at only one point in the domain completely determines the effective elasticity tensor. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

We prove such improvements using a quick application of our recent results (arXiv:1606.02057), which give modified growth estimates for eigenfunctions that equidistribute on small balls. Since by the results of Han and Hezari-Rivi\`ere small scale QE holds for negatively curved manifolds on logarithmically shrinking balls, we get logarithmic improvements on the inner radius of such manifolds. We also get improvements for manifolds with ergodic geodesic flows. In addition using the small scale equidistribution results of Lester-Rudnick, one gets polynomial betterments of for toral eigenfunctions in dimensions $n \geq 3$. The results work only for a full density subsequence of eigenfunctions. ;"Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Differential Geometry (math.DG); Spectral Theory (math.SP)"

We provide the equivalent characterizations of product Hardy spaces associated with Bessel operators in terms of the Bessel Riesz transforms, non-tangential and radial maximal functions defined via Poisson and heat semigroups, based on the atomic decomposition, the extension of Merryfield's result which connects the product non-tangential maximal function and area function, and on the grand maximal function technique which connects the product non-tangential and radial maximal function. We then obtain directly the decomposition of the product BMO space associated with Bessel operators. These results are a first extension for product Hardy and BMO associated to a differential operator other than the Laplacian and are a major step beyond the Chang--Fefferman setting. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03613;Gaussian curvature as an identifier of shell rigidity; Davit Harutyunyan;"  In the paper we deal with shells with non-zero Gaussian curvature. We derive sharp Korn's first (linear geometric rigidity estimate) and second inequalities on that kind of shells for zero or periodic Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin type boundary conditions. We prove that if the Gaussian curvature is positive, then the optimal constant in the first Korn inequality scales like $h,$ and if the Gaussian curvature is negative, then the Korn constant scales like $h^{4/3},$ where $h$ is the thickness of the shell. These results have classical flavour in continuum mechanics, in particular shell theory. The Korn first inequalities are the linear version of the famous geometric rigidity estimate by Friesecke, James and M\""uller for plates [14] (where they show that the Korn constant in the nonlinear Korn's first inequality scales like $h^2$), extended to shells with nonzero curvature. We also recover the uniform Korn-Poincar\'e inequality proven for ""boundary-less"" shells by Lewicka and M\""uller in [37] in the setting of our problem. The new estimates can also be applied to find the scaling law for the critical buckling load of the shell under in-plane loads as well as to derive energy scaling laws in the pre-buckled regime. The exponents $1$ and $4/3$ in the present work appear for the first time in any sharp geometric rigidity estimate. ";Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

It is shown that the resulting models can be understood as purely geometric evolution laws, where the motion of the separating interface depends in a non-local way on the mean curvature. It turns out that the models are volume preserving and surface area reducing, the latter property giving rise to a Lyapunov function.

In this paper, a geometric generalization of the sphere-valued model is considered, where the solutions are supposed to take values in compact Riemann surfaces. As a main results, time-local existence and the uniqueness of a solution to the initial value problem is established under the assumption that the sectional curvature of the Riemann surface is constant. The analytic difficulty comes from the so-called loss of derivatives and the absence of the local smoothing effect. The proof is based on the geometric energy method combined with a kind of gauge transformation to eliminate the loss of derivatives. Specifically, to show the uniqueness of the solution, the detailed geometric analysis of the solvable structure for the equation is presented. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

We will restrict us to the case of the so called compressible Navier-Stokes system with quantum pressure which corresponds to consider the capillary coefficient $\kappa(\rho)=\frac{\kappa_1}{\rho}$ with $\kappa_1>0$. In a first part we prove the existence of strong solution in finite time for large initial data with a precise bound by below on the life span $T^*$. This one depends on the norm of the initial data $(\rho_0,v_0)$. The second part consists in proving the existence of global strong solution with particular choice on the capillary coefficient ( where $\kappa_1=\mu^2$) and on the viscosity tensor which corresponds to the viscous shallow water case $-2\mu{\rm div}(\rho Du)$. To do this we derivate different energy estimate on the density and the effective velocity $v$ which ensures that the strong solution can be extended beyond $T^*$. The main difficulty consists in controlling the vacuum or in other words to estimate the $L^\infty$ norm of $\frac{1}{\rho}$. The proof relies mostly on a method introduced by De Giorgi \cite{DG} (see also Ladyzhenskaya et al in \cite{La} for the parabolic case) to obtain regularity results for elliptic equations with discontinuous diffusion coefficients and a suitable bootstrap argument. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04151;The Yang-Mills heat equation with finite action; Leonard Gross;  The existence and uniqueness of solutions to the Yang-Mills heat equation is proven over three dimensional Euclidean space and over a bounded open convex set therein. The initial data is taken to lie in the Sobolev space of order one half, which is the critical Sobolev index for this equation over a three dimensional manifold. The existence is proven by solving first an augmented, strictly parabolic equation and then gauge transforming the solution to a solution of the Yang-Mills heat equation itself. The gauge functions needed to carry out this procedure lie in the critical gauge group of Sobolev regularity three halves, which is a complete topological group in a natural metric but is not a Hilbert Lie group. The nature of this group must be understood in order to carry out the reconstruction procedure. Solutions to the Yang-Mills heat equation are shown to be strong solutions modulo these gauge functions. Energy inequalities and Neumann domination inequalities are used to establish needed initial behavior properties of solutions to the augmented equation. ;"Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)"

First, we give global variational characterizations of each of these periodic waves, which in particular provide alternate proofs of their orbital stability with respect to same-period perturbations, restricted to certain subspaces. Second, we prove the spectral stability of the cnoidal waves against same-period perturbations (in a certain parameter range), and provide an alternate proof of this (known) fact for the snoidal waves, which does not rely on complete integrability. Third, we give a rigorous version of a formal asymptotic calculation of Rowlands to establish the instability of a class of real-valued periodic waves in 1D, which includes the cnoidal waves of the 1D cubic focusing nonlinear Schr{\""o}dinger equation, against perturbations with period a large multiple of their fundamental period. Finally, we develop a numerical method to compute the minimizers of the energy with fixed mass and momentum constraints. Numerical experiments support and complete our analytical results.

We establish improved regularity estimates for the trace of the variational solution on the Ventcel face, and use them to derive a decomposition of the solution into a regular and a singular part that belongs to suitable weighted Sobolev spaces. This decomposition, in turn, via interpolation estimates both in the interior as well as on the Ventcel face, allows us to perform an a priori error analysis for the Finite Element approximation of the solution on anisotropic graded meshes.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04470;Landau damping to partially locked states in the Kuramoto model; Helge Dietert,  Bastien Fernandez,  David Gérard-Varet;  In the Kuramoto model of globally coupled oscillators, partially locked states (PLS) are stationary solutions that incorporate the emergence of partial synchrony when the interaction strength increases. While PLS have long been considered, existing results on their stability are limited to neutral stability of the linearized dynamics in strong topology, or to specific invariant subspaces (obtained via the so-called Ott-Antonsen (OA) ansatz) with specific frequency distributions for the oscillators. In the mean field limit, the Kuramoto model shows various ingredients of the Landau damping mechanism in the Vlasov equation. This analogy has been a source of inspiration for stability proofs of regular Kuramoto equilibria. Besides, the major mathematical issue with PLS asymptotic stability is that these states consist of heterogeneous and singular measures. Here, we establish an explicit criterion for their spectral stability and we prove their local asymptotic stability in weak topology, for a large class of analytic frequency marginals. The proof strongly relies on a suitable functional space that contains (Fourier transforms of) singular measures, and for which the linearized dynamics is well under control. For illustration, the stability criterion is evaluated in some standard examples. We show in particular that no loss of generality results in assuming the OA ansatz. To our best knowledge, our result provides the first proof of Landau damping to heterogeneous and irregular equilibria, in absence of dissipation. ;"Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems (nlin.AO)"

By $\Gamma$-convergence we derive a one-dimensional limit theory and show that isolated local minimizers of the limit model can be approached by local minimizers of the three-dimensional model. In the case of isotropic materials and for two-layers prestrained three-dimensional models the limit energy further simplifies to that of a Kirchhoff rod-model of an intrinsically curved beam. In this case we study the limit theory and investigate global and/or local stability of straight and helical configurations. Through some simple simulations we finally compare our results with real experiments. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

The solvation free-energy functional of all phase fields consists of the surface energy, solute excluded volume and solute-solvent van der Waals dispersion energy, and electrostatic free energy. The surface energy is defined by the van der Waals--Cahn--Hilliard functional with squared gradient and a double-well potential. The electrostatic part of free energy is defined through the electrostatic potential governed by the Poisson--Boltzmann equation in which the dielectric coefficient is defined through the underlying phase field. We prove the continuity of the electrostatics---its potential, free energy, and dielectric boundary force---with respect to the perturbation of dielectric boundary. We also prove the $\Gamma$-convergence of the phase-field free-energy functionals to their sharp-interface limit, and the equivalence of the convergence of total free energies to that of all individual parts of free energy. We finally prove the convergence of phase-field forces to their sharp-interface limit. Such forces are defined as the negative first variations of the free-energy functional; and arise from stress tensors. In particular, we obtain the force convergence for the van der Waals--Cahn--Hilliard functionals with minimal assumptions. ";Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

It is assumed that the former is degenerate, that is, it vanishes at zero, which is one of the equilibrium points of the reaction. A parabolic regularization technique is introduced in order to locate a subset of the compression spectrum of the linearized operator around the wave, whereas the point spectrum is proved to be stable with the use of energy estimates. Detailed asymptotic decay estimates of solutions to spectral equations are required in order to close the energy estimates.

This result together with a higher order energy estimate leads to the well-posedness of the linearized system, and then a local in time solution of the original system which is regular in temporal variable follows via a fixed point argument. Secondly, the hydrodynamic part of the coupled system can be reformulated into a quasi-stationary Stokes type equation to which the regularity theory of the generalized Stokes system, and then a bootstrap argument can be applied to enhance the spatial regularity of the local in time solution. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

We only know random noise data $g_{ij}(t)$ and $d_{ij}$ satisfying the regression models g_{ij}(t) &=& f(x_i,y_j,t) + \vartheta\xi_{ij}(t), d_{ij} &=& h(x_i,y_j) + \sigma_{ij}\epsilon_{ij}, where $\xi_{ij}(t)$ are Brownian motions, $\epsilon_{ij}\sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$, $(x_i,y_j)$ are grid points of $\Omega$ and $\sigma_{ij}, \vartheta$ are unknown positive constants. The noises $\xi_{ij}(t), \epsilon_{ij}$ are mutually independent. From the known data $g_{ij}(t)$ and $d_{ij}$, we can recovery the initial temperature $\theta(x,y)$. However, the result thus obtained is not stable and the problem is severely ill--posed. To regularize the instable solution, we use the trigonometric method in nonparametric regression associated with the truncated expansion method. In addition, convergence rate is also investigated numerically. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

To this end, two types of schemes are suggested and their analysis are given. The superlensing devices proposed are independent of the object. It is worth noting that the study of hyperbolic metamaterials is challenging due to the change type of modelling equations, elliptic in some regions, hyperbolic in some others. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

It is shown that such a nonlocal dispersal system has a principal eigenvalue in the following cases: the nonlocal dispersal distance is sufficiently small; the spatial inhomogeneity satisfies a so called vanishing condition; or the spatial inhomogeneity is nearly globally homogeneous. Moreover, it is shown that the principal eigenvalue of a time periodic cooperative linear nonlocal dispersal system (if it exists) is algebraically simple. A linear nonlocal dispersal system may not have a principal eigenvalue. The results established in the current paper extend those in literature for time independent or periodic nonlocal dispersal equations to time periodic cooperative nonlocal dispersal systems and {will} serve as {a} basic tool for the study of cooperative nonlinear systems with nonlocal dispersal.

Modeling assumptions translate the problem into classical elasto-static system (homogeneous and isotropic) in an half-space with an embedded cavity. The boundary conditions are traction-free for the air/crust boundary and uniformly hydrostatic for the crust/chamber boundary. These are complemented with zero-displacement condition at infinity (with decay rate). After a short presentation of the model and of its geophysical interest, we establish the well-posedness of the problem and provide an appropriate integral formulation for its solution for cavity with general shape. Based on that, assuming that the chamber is centred at some fixed point $\bm{z}$ and has diameter $\varepsilon>0$, small with respect to the depth $d$, we derive rigorously the principal term in the asymptotic expansion for the surface deformation as $\varepsilon=r/d\to 0^+$. Such formula provides a rigorous proof of the Mogi point source model in the case of spherical cavities generalizing it to the case of cavities of arbitrary shape. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06231;$L^{p}$ measure of growth and higher order Hardy-Sobolev-Morrey  inequalities; Patrick J. Rabier;  When the growth at infinity of a function $u$ on $\Bbb{R}^{N}$ is compared with the growth of $|x|^{s}$ for some $s\in \Bbb{R},$ this comparison is invariably made pointwise. This paper argues that the comparison can also be made in a suitably defined $L^{p}$ sense for every $1\leq p<\infty $ and that, in this perspective, inequalities of Hardy, Sobolev or Morrey type account for the fact that sub $|x|^{-N/p}$ growth of $\nabla u$ in the $% L^{p} $ sense implies sub $|x|^{1-N/p}$ growth of $u$ in the $L^{q}$ sense for well chosen values of $q.$ By investigating how sub $|x|^{s}$ growth of $\nabla ^{k}u$ in the $L^{p}$ sense implies sub $|x|^{s+j}$ growth of $\nabla ^{k-j}u$ in the $L^{q}$ sense for (almost) arbitrary $s\in \Bbb{R}$ and for $q$ in a $p$-dependent range of values, a family of higher order Hardy/Sobolev/Morrey type inequalities is obtained, under optimal integrability assumptions. These optimal inequalities take the form of estimates for $\nabla ^{k-j}(u-\pi _{u}),1\leq j\leq k,$ where $\pi _{u}$ is a suitable polynomial of degree at most $k-1,$ which is unique if and only if $s<-k.$ More generally, it can be chosen independent of $(s,p)$ when $s$ remains in the same connected component of $\Bbb{R}\backslash \{-k,...,-1\}.$ ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

The plasmonic device takes a general core-shell-matrix form with the metamaterial located in the shell. It is shown that the plasmonic device in the literature which induces resonance in $\mathbb{R}^2$ does not induce resonance in $\mathbb{R}^3$. We then construct two novel plasmonic devices with suitable plasmon constants, varying according to the source term or the loss parameter, which can induce resonances. If there is no core, we show that resonance always occurs. If there is a core of an arbitrary shape, we show that the resonance strongly depends on the location of the source. In fact, there exists a critical radius such that resonance occurs for sources lying within the critical radius, whereas resonance does not occur for source lying outside the critical radius. Our argument is based on the variational technique by making use of the primal and dual variational principles for the elastostatic system, along with the highly technical construction of the associated perfect plasmon elastic waves. ;"Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06533;Stochastic homogenization of nonconvex discrete energies with degenerate  growth; Stefan Neukamm,  Mathias Schaffner,  Anja Schlomerkemper;  We study the continuum limit of discrete, nonconvex energy functionals defined on crystal lattices in dimensions $d\geq 2$. Since we are interested in energy functionals with random (stationary and ergodic) pair interactions, our problem corresponds to a stochastic homogenization problem. In the non-degenerate case, when the interactions satisfy a uniform $p$-growth condition, the homogenization problem is well-understood. In this paper, we are interested in a degenerate situation, when the interactions neither satisfy a uniform growth condition from above nor from below. We consider interaction potentials that obey a $p$-growth condition with a random growth weight $\lambda$. We show that if $\lambda$ satisfies the moment condition $\mathbb E[\lambda^\alpha+\lambda^{-\beta}]<\infty$ for suitable values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$, then the discrete energy $\Gamma$-converges to an integral functional with a non-degenerate energy density. In the scalar case it suffices to assume that $\alpha\geq 1$ and $\beta\geq\frac{1}{p-1}$ (which is just the condition that ensures the non-degeneracy of the homogenized energy density). In the general, vectorial case, we additionally require that $\alpha>1$ and $\frac{1}{\alpha}+\frac{1}{\beta}\leq \frac{p}{d}$. Recently, there has been considerable effort to understand periodic and stochastic homogenization of elliptic equations and integral functionals with degenerate growth, as well as related questions on the effective behavior of conductance models in degenerate, random environments. The results in the present paper are to our knowledge the first stochastic homogenization results for nonconvex energy functionals with degenerate growth under moment conditions. ;"Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Functional Analysis (math.FA); Probability (math.PR)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06583;Domain formation in membranes near the onset of instability; Irene Fonseca,  Gurgen Hayrapetyan,  Giovanni Leoni,  Barbara Zwicknagl;  The formation of microdomains, also called rafts, in biomembranes can be attributed to the surface tension of the membrane. In order to model this phenomenon, a model involving a coupling between the local composition and the local curvature was proposed by Seul and Andelman in 1995. In addition to the familiar Cahn-Hilliard/Modica-Mortola energy, there are additional `forces' that prevent large domains of homogeneous concentration. This is taken into account by the bending energy of the membrane, which is coupled to the value of the order parameter, and reflects the notion that surface tension associated with a slightly curved membrane influences the localization of phases as the geometry of the lipids has an effect on the preferred placement on the membrane. The main result of the paper is the study of the $\Gamma$-convergence of this family of energy functionals, involving nonlocal as well as negative terms. Since the minimizers of the limiting energy have minimal interfaces, the physical interpretation is that, within a sufficiently strong interspecies surface tension and a large enough sample size, raft microdomains are not formed. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

The assumptions on $g$ are very mild and allow the nonlinearity to be possibly supercritical in the sense of Sobolev embeddings. We prove the existence of a nonconstant, positive, radially nondecreasing solution via variational methods. In the case $g(u)=|u|^{q-2}u$, we detect the asymptotic behavior of these solutions as $q\to\infty$. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

Green;"  Let $H=-\Delta+V$ be a Schr\""odinger operator on $L^2(\mathbb R^4)$ with real-valued potential $V$, and let $H_0=-\Delta$. If $V$ has sufficient pointwise decay, the wave operators $W_{\pm}=s-\lim_{t\to \pm\infty} e^{itH}e^{-itH_0}$ are known to be bounded on $L^p(\mathbb R^4)$ for all $1\leq p\leq \infty$ if zero is not an eigenvalue or resonance, and on $\frac43<p<4$ if zero is an eigenvalue but not a resonance. We show that in the latter case, the wave operators are also bounded on $L^p(\mathbb R^4)$ for $1\leq p\leq \frac43$ by direct examination of the integral kernel of the leading terms. Furthermore, if $\int_{\mathbb R^4} xV(x) \psi(x) \, dx=0$ for all zero energy eigenfunctions $\psi$, then the wave operators are bounded on $L^p$ for $1 \leq p<\infty$. ";Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

We first apply the local stability analysis to establish sufficient conditions of destabilization for uniform steady-state solution. Then, weakly nonlinear analysis with multi-scales is used to deal with the emerging process of patterns near the bifurcation point. For the single unstable mode case, we derive the Stuart-Landau equations describing the evolution of the amplitude, and thus the asymptotic expressions of patterns are obtained in both supercritical case and subcritical case. While for the case of multiple unstable modes, we also derive coupled amplitude equations to study the competitive behavior between two unstable modes through the phase plane analysis. In particular, we find that the initial data play a dominant role in the competition. All the theoretical and numerical results are in excellently qualitative agreement and better quantitative agreement than that in [1]. Moreover, in the subcritical case, we confirm the existence of stationary patterns with larger amplitudes when the bifurcation parameter is less than the first bifurcation point, which gives an positive answer to the open problem proposed in [2]. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07052;On the wellposedness of the defocusing mKdV equation below $L^{2}$; Thomas Kappeler,  Jan-Cornelius Molnar;  We prove that the renormalized defocusing mKdV equation on the circle is locally in time $C^{0}$-wellposed on the Fourier Lebesgue space ${\mathcal{F}\ell}^p$ for any $2 < p < \infty$. The result implies that the defocusing mKdV equation itself is illposed on these spaces since the renormalizing phase factor becomes infinite. The proof is based on the fact that the mKdV equation is an integrable PDE whose Hamiltonian is in the NLS hierarchy. A key ingredient is a novel way of representing the bi-infinite sequence of frequencies of the renormalized defocusing mKdV equation, allowing to analytically extend them to ${\mathcal{F}\ell}^p$ for any $2 \le p < \infty$ and to deduce asymptotics for $n \to \pm \infty$. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

Specifically, evolution equations wherein the unknown is an operator acting on a Banach space are investigated. Here, the mirror non-Abelian Burgers equation is considered: it can be written as $r_t = r_{xx} + 2r_x r$. The structural properties of the admitted recursion operator are studied; thus, it is proved to be a strong symmetry for the mirror non-Abelian Burgers equation as well as to be the hereditary. These results are proved via direct computations as well as via computer assisted manipulations; ad hoc routines are needed to treat non-Abelian quantities and relations among them. The obtained recursion operator generates the $mirror$ non-Abelian Burgers hierarchy. The latter, when the unknown operator $r$ is replaced by a real valued function reduces to the usual (commutative) Burgers hierarchy. Accordingly, also the recursion operator reduces to the usual Burgers one. ";"Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)"

We obtain the asymptotics of solitary waves in the nonrelativistic limit $\omega\lesssim m$; these asymptotics are important for the linear stability analysis of solitary wave solutions. We also show that in the case when the power of the nonlinearity is Schr\""odinger charge-critical, one has $Q'(\omega)<0$ for $\omega\lesssim m$, implying the absence of the degeneracy of zero eigenvalue of the linearization at a solitary wave.

This is the first symplectic non-squeezing result for a Hamiltonian PDE in infinite volume. As the underlying symplectic Hilbert space is $L^2(\R^2)$, this requires working with initial data in this space. This space also happens to be scaling-critical for this equation. Thus, we also obtain the first unconditional symplectic non-squeezing result in such a critical setting. More generally, we show that solutions of this PDE can be approximated by a finite-dimensional Hamiltonian system, despite the wealth of non-compact symmetries: scaling, translation, and Galilei boosts. This approximation result holds uniformly on bounded sets of initial data. Complementing this approximation result, we show that all solutions of the finite-dimensional Hamiltonian system can be approximated by the full PDE.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08066;Quantum ergodicity and $L^p$ norms of restrictions of eigenfunctions; Hamid Hezari;  We prove an analogue of Sogge's local $L^p$ estimates for $L^p$ norms of restrictions of eigenfunctions to submanifolds, and use it to show that for quantum ergodic eigenfunctions one can get improvements of the results of Burq-G\'erard-Tzvetkov, Hu, and Chen-Sogge. The improvements are logarithmic on negatively curved manifolds (without boundary) and by $o(1)$ for manifolds (with or without boundary) with ergodic geodesic flows. In the case of ergodic billiards with piecewise smooth boundary, we get $o(1)$ improvements on $L^\infty$ estimates of Cauchy data away from a shrinking neighborhood of the corners, and as a result using the methods of Ghosh-Reznikov-Sarnak and Jung-Zelditch, we get that the number of nodal domains of two dimensional ergodic billiards tends to infinity as $\lambda \to \infty$. These results work only for a full density subsequence of any given orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions. We also present an extension of the $L^p$ estimates of Burq-G\'erard-Tzvetkov, Hu, and Chen-Sogge, for the restrictions of Dirichlet and Neumann eigenfunctions to compact submanifolds of the interior of manifolds with piecewise smooth boundary. This part does not assume ergodicity on the manifolds. ;"Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA); Differential Geometry (math.DG); Spectral Theory (math.SP)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08126;On the Geometric Regularity Conditions for the 3D Navier-Stokes  Equations; Dongho Chae,  Jihoon Lee;  We prove geometrically improved version of Prodi-Serrin type blow-up criterion. Let $v$ and $\omega$ be the velocity and the vorticity of solutions to the 3D Navier-Stokes equations and denote $\{f\}_+=\max\{f, 0\}$ , $Q_T=\Bbb R^3\times (0, T)$. If $\left\{\left( v \times \frac{\omega}{|\omega|} \right)\cdot \frac{\Lambda^{\beta}v}{|\Lambda^{\beta}v|}\right\}_+ \in L^{\gamma, \alpha}_{x,t} (Q_T)$ with $3/\gamma +2/\alpha \leq 1$ for some $\gamma >3$ and $1 \leq \beta \leq 2$, then the local smooth solution $v$ of the Navier-Stokes equations on $(0,T)$ can be continued to $(0, T+\delta)$ for some $\delta >0$. We also prove localized version of a special case of this. Let $v$ be a suitable weak solution to the Navier-tokes equations in a space-time domain containing $z_0= (x_0, t_0)$, let $Q_{z_0, r}=B_{x_0, r} \times (t_0-r^2, t_0)$ be a parabolic cylinder in the domain. We show that if either $\left\{\left( v \times \frac{\omega}{|\omega|}\right) \cdot \frac{\nabla \times \omega}{|\nabla \times \omega|}\right\}_{+} \in L^{\gamma, \alpha}_{x,t}(Q_{z_0, r})$ with $\frac{3}{\gamma}+\frac{2}{\alpha} \leq 1$, or $\left\{\left(\frac{v}{|v|} \times \omega\right) \cdot \frac{\nabla \times \omega}{|\nabla \times \omega|}\right\}_{+} \in L^{\gamma, \alpha}_{x,t}(Q_{z_0, r})$ with $\frac{3}{\gamma}+\frac{2}{\alpha} \leq 2$, ($\gamma \geq 2$, $\alpha \geq 2$), then $z_0$ is a regular point for $v$. This improves previous local regularity criteria for the suitable weak solutions. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08417;Min-max formulas for nonlocal elliptic operators; Nestor Guillen,  Russell W. Schwab;"  In this work, we give a characterization of Lipschitz operators on spaces of $C^2(M)$ functions (also $C^{1,1}$, $C^{1,\gamma}$, $C^1$, $C^\gamma$) that obey the global comparison property-- i.e. those that preserve the global ordering of input functions at any points where their graphs may touch, often called ""elliptic"" operators. Here $M$ is a complete Riemannian manifold. In particular, we show that all such operators can be written as a min-max over linear operators that are a combination of drift-diffusion and integro-differential parts. In the \emph{linear} (and nonlocal) case, Courr\`ege had characterized these operators in the 1960's, and in the \emph{local, but nonlinear} case-- e.g. local Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman operators-- this characterization has also been known for quite some time. Our result gives both a nonlinear extension of Courr\`ege's and a nonlocal extension of well known results for local Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations. It also shows any nonlinear scalar elliptic equation can be represented as an Isaacs equation for an appropriate differential game. Our approach is to ""project"" the operator to a finite dimensional space, where a min-max formula is easier, and then the min-max can be appropriately lifted to the original operator on the infinite dimensional space. As one application, we mention some preliminary results about the structure of Dirichlet-to-Neumann mappings for second order elliptic equations, including fully nonlinear equations. This is the Director's cut, and it contains extra details for our own sanity. ";"Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Functional Analysis (math.FA); Optimization and Control (math.OC); Probability (math.PR)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08481;Finite time blowup for Lagrangian modifications of the three-dimensional  Euler equation; Terence Tao;"  In the language of differential geometry, the incompressible inviscid Euler equations can be written in vorticity-vector potential form as \begin{align*} \partial_t \omega + {\mathcal L}_u \omega &= 0\\ u &= \delta \tilde \eta^{-1} \Delta^{-1} \omega \end{align*} where $\omega$ is the vorticity $2$-form, ${\mathcal L}_u$ denotes the Lie derivative with respect to the velocity field $u$, $\Delta$ is the Hodge Laplacian, $\delta$ is the codifferential (the negative of the divergence operator), and $\tilde \eta^{-1}$ is the canonical map from $2$-forms to $2$-vector fields induced by the Euclidean metric $\eta$. In this paper we consider a generalisation of these Euler equations in three spatial dimensions, in which the vector potential operator $\tilde \eta^{-1} \Delta^{-1}$ is replaced by a more general operator $A$ of order $-2$; this retains the Lagrangian structure of the Euler equations, as well as most of its conservation laws and local existence theory. Despite this, we give three different constructions of such an operator $A$ which admits smooth solutions that blow up in finite time, including an example on ${\bf R}^3$ which is self-adjoint and positive definite. This indicates a barrier to establishing global regularity for the three-dimensional Euler equations, in that any such method must use some property of those equations that is not shared by the generalised Euler equations considered here.

The diffusion flux function is assumed to be of a forward-backward type that contains two forward-diffusion phases. We prove that, for all smooth initial data, there exists at least one weak solution whose spatial derivative stays in the two forward phases. Also, for all smooth initial data that have a derivative value lying in a certain phase transition range, we show that there exist infinitely many such solutions that exhibit instantaneous phase transitions between the two forward phases. Moreover, we introduce the notion of transition gauge for such forward solutions and prove that the gauge of all constructed two-phase forward solutions can be arbitrarily close to a certain fixed constant. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08625;On the $\mathcal{R}$-boundedness of solution operator families for  two-phase Stokes resolvent equations; Sri Maryani,  Hirokazu Saito;  The aim of this paper is to show the existence of $\mathcal{R}$-bounded solution operator families for two-phase Stokes resolvent equations in $\dot\Omega=\Omega_+\cup\Omega_-$, where $\Omega_\pm$ are uniform $W_r^{2-1/r}$ domains of $N$-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbf{R}^N$ ($N\geq 2$, $N<r<\infty$). More precisely, given a uniform $W_r^{2-1/r}$ domain $\Omega$ with two boundaries $\Gamma_\pm$ satisfying $\Gamma_+\cap\Gamma_-=\emptyset$, we suppose that some hypersurface $\Gamma$ divides $\Omega$ into two sub-domains, that is, there exist domains $\Omega_\pm\subset\Omega$ such that $\Omega_+\cap\Omega_-=\emptyset$ and $\Omega\setminus\Gamma=\Omega_+\cup\Omega_-$, where $\Gamma\cap\Gamma_+=\emptyset$, $\Gamma\cap\Gamma_-=\emptyset$, and the boundaries of $\Omega_\pm$ consist of two parts $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma_\pm$, respectively. The domains $\Omega_\pm$ are filled with viscous, incompressible, and immiscible fluids with density $\rho_\pm$ and viscosity $\mu_\pm$, respectively. Here $\rho_\pm$ are positive constants, while $\mu_\pm=\mu_\pm(x)$ are functions of $x\in\mathbf{R}^N$. On the boundaries $\Gamma$, $\Gamma_+$, and $\Gamma_-$, we consider an interface condition, a free boundary condition, and the Dirichlet boundary condition, respectively. We also show, by using the $\mathcal{R}$-bounded solution operator families, some maximal $L_p\text{-}L_q$ regularity as well as generation of analytic semigroup for a time-dependent problem associated with the two-phase Stokes resolvent equations. This kind of problems arises in the mathematical study of the motion of two viscous, incompressible, and immiscible fluids with free surfaces. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

We extend the freezing method from first to second order equations in time. When applied to a Cauchy problem, this method generates a comoving frame in which the solution becomes stationary. In addition it generates an algebraic variable which converges to the speed of the wave, provided the original wave satisfies certain spectral conditions and initial perturbations are sufficiently small. We develop a rigorous theory for this effect by recourse to some recent nonlinear stability results for waves in first order hyperbolic systems.

One can totally divide the range of $\lambda\ge0$ and $\mu>0$ into the following four cases: Case 1: $0\le\lambda<1$, $\mu>0$ for $d=2,3$; Case 2: $\lambda=1$, $\mu>3-d$ for $d=2,3$; Case 3: $\lambda=1$, $\mu\le 3-d$ for $d=2$; Case 4: $\lambda>1$, $\mu>0$ for $d=2,3$. \noindent We show that there exists a global $C^{\infty}-$smooth solution $(\rho, u)$ in Case 1, and Case 2 with $\operatorname{curl} u_0\equiv 0$, while in Case 3 and Case 4, in general, the solution $(\rho, u)$ blows up in finite time.

Next, we introduce a class of wave-like equations that are equivalent to forward-forward MFGs, and we derive a novel formulation as a system of conservation laws. For first-order logarithmic forward-forward MFG, we establish the existence of a global solution. Then, we consider a class of explicit solutions and show the existence of shocks.

We estimate the error between approximate solutions constructed by the upwind scheme and distributional solutions of the continuous problem in a Kantorovich-Rubinstein distance, which was recently used for stability estimates for the continuity equation by Seis [23]. Restricted to Cartesian meshes, our estimate shows that the rate of weak convergence is at least of order $1/2$ in the mesh size. The proof relies on a probabilistic interpretation of the upwind scheme Delarue and Lagouti\`ere [9]. We complement the weak convergence result with an example that illustrates that for rough initial data no rates can be expected in strong norms. The same example suggests that the weak order $1/2$ rate is optimal. ;"Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Probability (math.PR)"

The first main purpose of this paper is to establish a linearized stability theorem for parabolic differential equations in Banach manifolds which are either invariant or quasi-invariant under actions of a number of Lie groups. The second purpose of this paper is to apply this theorem to analyze stability of stationary solutions of some free boundary problems. In order to apply the abstract result to concrete free boundary problems, Banach manifold made up of certain kind of domains such as simple domains in ${\mathbf{R}}^n$ is a fundamental tool which seems to have not been well-studied in the literature yet. Hence in this paper we also make some basic investigation to a such manifold. In Section 5 we use Nash-Moser implicit function theorem to prove an interesting result for an obstacle problem which says that if the domain $\Omega$ of this obstacle problem is a small perturbation of a sphere then its interface $\Gamma$ is smooth and depends on $\Omega$ smoothly. By using these results, in the last section we prove asymptotic stability of radial stationary solution of a free boundary problem modeling the growth of necrotic tumors, which has been kept open for over ten years. ;"Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA); Differential Geometry (math.DG); Dynamical Systems (math.DS); Functional Analysis (math.FA)"

The case of what we call diagonally dominant kernels is particularly interesting. Here one expects that the long-time behaviour is, after a suitable change of variables, the same as for the Burgers equation. However, for kernels that are close to the diagonal one we obtain instability of both, constant solutions and traveling waves and in general no convergence to N-waves for integrable data. On the other hand, for kernels not close to the diagonal one these structures are stable, but the traveling waves have strong oscillations. This has implications on the approach towards an N-wave for integrable data, which is also characterized by strong oscillations near the shock front. ;"Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)"

The model couples three essential ingredients of magnetized plasmas: a transport equation for the probability density function, which models energetic rarefied particles of one species; the incompressible Navier--Stokes system for the bulk fluid; and a parabolic evolution equation, involving magnetic diffusivity, for the magnetic field. The physical derivation of our model is given. It is also shown that the weak solution, whose existence is established, has nonincreasing total energy, and that it satisfies a number of physically relevant properties, including conservation of the total momentum, conservation of the total mass, and nonnegativity of the probability density function for the energetic particles. The proof is based on a one-level approximation scheme, which is carefully devised to avoid increase of the total energy for the sequence of approximating solutions, in conjunction with a weak compactness argument for the sequence of approximating solutions. The key technical challenges in the analysis of the mathematical model are the nondissipative nature of the Vlasov-type particle equation and passage to the weak limits in the multilinear coupling terms.

More precisely, we obtain the local existence and uniqueness of the solutions when the viscosity coefficient of fluid depends on density. Moreover, we establish blowup criterions for the regularity of the strong solutions in dimension two and three respectively. In particular, we build a blowup criterion just in terms of the gradient of density if the initial direction field satisfies some geometric configuration. For these results, the initial density needs not be strictly positive. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

More precisely, we study the expansion of the corresponding profile of this isoperimetric (or isochoric) problem as the volume tends to zero. The main difficulty encountered in our study is the lack of existence results for maximizing domains and the possible degeneracy of the first nontrivial Steklov eigenvalue, which makes it difficult to tackle the problem with domain variation techniques. As a corollary of our results, we deduce local comparison principles for the profile in terms of the scalar curvature on $\mathcal{M}$. In the case where the underlying manifold is a closed surface, we obtain a global expansion and thus a global comparison principle. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

The latter problem bears many similarities to a $2$-equivariant wave map into a surface of revolution. As in the case of $1$-equivariant wave maps considered in~\cite{LOS1}, both problems admit a family of stationary solutions indexed by a parameter that determines how far the image of the map wraps around the target manifold. Here we show that if the image of a stationary solution is contained in a geodesically convex subset of the target, then it is asymptotically stable in the energy space. However, for a stationary solution that covers a large enough portion of the target, we prove that the Schr\""odinger operator obtained by linearizing about such a harmonic map admits a simple positive eigenvalue in the spectral gap. As there is no a priori nonlinear obstruction to asymptotic stability, this gives evidence for the existence of metastable states (i.e., solutions with anomalously slow decay rates) in these simple geometric models.

In the previous works about optimal time decay rate, the initial data need to be small in $H^{[N/2]+2}(\mathbb{R}^{N})$. Our work combined negative Besov space estimates and the conventional energy estimates in Besov space framework which is developed by R. Danchin. Though our methods, we can get optimal time decay rate with initial data just small in $\dot{B}^{N/2-1, N/2+1} \cap \dot{B}^{N/2-1, N/2}$ and belong to some negative Besov space(need not to be small). Finally, combining the recent results in \cite{zhang2014} with our methods, we can only need the initial data to be small in homogeneous Besov space $\dot{B}^{N/2-2, N/2} \cap \dot{B}^{N/2-1}$ to get the optimal time decay rate in space $L^{2}$. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

When $a\in C^\infty(S^{n-1})$ and $g$ is $C^\infty(\Omega)$, solutions are known to be $C^\infty$ inside~$\Omega$ (but not up to the boundary). However, when $a$ is a general measure, or even when $a$ is $L^\infty(S^{n-1})$, solutions are only known to be $C^{3s}$ inside $\Omega$. We prove here that, for general measures $a$, solutions are $C^{1+3s-\epsilon}$ inside $\Omega$ for all $\epsilon>0$ whenever $\Omega$ is convex. When $a\in L^{\infty}(S^{n-1})$, we show that the same holds in all $C^{1,1}$ domains. In particular, solutions always possess a classical first derivative. The assumptions on the domain are sharp, since if the domain is not convex and the spectral measure is singular, we construct an explicit counterexample for which $u$ is \emph{not} $C^{3s+\epsilon}$ for any $\epsilon>0$ -- even if $g$ and $\Omega$ are $C^\infty$. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

We also prove the continuous dependence of the solution with respect to the data, as well as, in a coercive case, the asymptotic stabilization as time $t\rightarrow+\infty$ towards the stationary solution. In a particular situation, motivated by the transported sandpile problem, we give sufficient conditions for the equivalence of the first order problem with gradient constraint with a two obstacles problem, the obstacles being the signed distances to the boundary. This equivalence, in special conditions, illustrates also the possible stabilization of the solution in finite time. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

As an application, under the conditional assumption that Strichartz estimates are valid for the linear flow $e^{itL}$, we prove global well posedness in the energy space for subcritical powers $\gamma<1+\frac{4}{n-2}$, and scattering provided $\gamma>1+\frac4n$. When the domain is $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, by extending the Strichartz estimates due to Tataru [Tataru08], we prove that the conditional assumption is satisfied and deduce well posedness and scattering in the energy space. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

Titi,  Saber Trabelsi;  In this paper we introduce and analyze an algorithm for continuous data assimilation for a three-dimensional Brinkman-Forchheimer-extended Darcy (3D BFeD) model of porous media. This model is believed to be accurate when the flow velocity is too large for Darcy's law to be valid, and additionally the porosity is not too small. The algorithm is inspired by ideas developed for designing finite-parameters feedback control for dissipative systems. It aims to obtaining improved estimates of the state of the physical system by incorporating deterministic or noisy measurements and observations. Specifically, the algorithm involves a feedback control that nudges the large scales of the approximate solution toward those of the reference solution associated with the spatial measurements. In the first part of the paper, we present few results of existence and uniqueness of weak and strong solutions of the 3D BFeD system. The second part is devoted to the setting and convergence analysis of the data assimilation algorithm. ;"Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Optimization and Control (math.OC); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn); Geophysics (physics.geo-ph)"

On the other hand, when this condition holds, we show a H\""{o}lder modulus of continuity for $\overline{g}$. When the operator is linear we show that $\overline{g}$ is H\""{o}lder-$\frac{1}{d}$ up to a logarithmic factor. The proofs are based on a new geometric observation on the limiting behavior of $\overline{g}$ at rational directions, reducing to a class of two dimensional problems for projections of the homogenized operator.

Let $\Gamma_0$ be a compact set in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and $\Gamma_\delta$ be a $\delta$-neighborhood of $\Gamma_0$ for $\delta\in\mathbb{R}_+$. $\Gamma_\delta$ represents the virtual domain used for the blow-up construction. By incorporating suitably designed lossy layers, it is shown that if the generating set $\Gamma_0$ is a generic curve, then one would have an approximate full-cloak within $\delta^2$ to the perfect full-cloak; whereas if $\Gamma_0$ is the closure of an open subset on a flat surface, then one would have an approximate partial-cloak within $\delta$ to its perfect counterpart. The estimates derived are independent of the contents being cloaked; that is, the cloaking devices are capable of nearly cloaking an arbitrary content. Furthermore, as a significant byproduct, our argument allows the relaxation of the convexity requirement on $\Gamma_0$ in [28], which is critical for the Mosco convergence argument therein.

Ershkov;  A new presentation of general solution of Navier-Stokes equations is considered here. We consider equations of motion for 3-dimensional non-stationary incompressible flow. The field of flow velocity as well as the equation of momentum should be split to the sum of two components: an irrotational (curl-free) one, and a solenoidal (divergence-free) one. The obviously irrotational (curl-free) part of equation of momentum used for obtaining of the components of pressure gradient. As a term of such an equation, we used the irrotational (curl-free) vector field of flow velocity, which is given by the proper potential (besides, the continuity equation determines such a potential as a harmonic function). The other part of equation of momentum could also be split to the sum of 2 equations: - with zero curl for the field of flow velocity (viscous-free), and the proper Eq. with viscous effects but variable curl. A solenoidal Eq. with viscous effects is represented by the proper Heat equation for each component of flow velocity with variable curl. Non-viscous case is presented by the PDE-system of 3 linear differential equations (in regard to the time-parameter), depending on the components of solution of the above Heat Eq. for the components of flow velocity with variable curl. So, the existence of the general solution of Navier-Stokes equations is proved to be the question of existence of the proper solution for such a PDE-system of linear equations. Final solution is proved to be the sum of 2 components: - an irrotational (curl-free) one and a solenoidal (variable curl) components. ;"Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)"

The obstacle could be sound-soft or sound-hard. It is shown that the modulus of the far-field pattern in the backscattering aperture possesses a certain local maximum behavior, from which one can determine the exterior normal directions of the front sides/faces. Then by using the phaseless backscattering data corresponding to a few incident plane waves with suitably chosen incident directions, one can determine the exterior unit normal vector of each side/face of the obstacle. After the determination of the exterior unit normals, the recovery is reduced to a finite-dimensional problem of determining a location point of the obstacle and the distance of each side/face away from the location point. For the latter reconstruction, we need make use of the far-field data with phases.

These identities involve local boundary terms, in which the quantity $u/d^s|_{\partial\Omega}$ plays the role that $\partial u/\partial\nu$ plays in the second order case. Here, $u$ is any solution to $Lu=f(x,u)$ in $\Omega$, with $u=0$ in $\mathbb R^n\setminus\Omega$, and $d$ is the distance to $\partial\Omega$. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01439;Geometric aspects of Moser-Trudinger inequalities on complete  non-compact Riemannian manifolds with applications; Alexandru Kristály;  In this paper we investigate some geometric features of Moser-Trudinger inequalities on complete non-compact Riemannian manifolds. By exploring rearrangement arguments, isoperimetric estimates, and gluing local uniform estimates via Gromov's covering lemma, we characterize the validity of Moser-Trudinger inequalities on complete non-compact $n-$dimensional Riemannian manifolds $(n\geq 2)$ with Ricci curvature bounded from below in terms of the volume growth of geodesic balls. These arguments also yield sharp Moser-Trudinger inequalities on Hadamard manifolds which satisfy the Cartan-Hadamard conjecture (e.g., in dimensions 2, 3 and 4). As application, by combining variational arguments, we guarantee the existence of a non-zero isometry-invariant solution for an elliptic problem involving a critical nonlinearity on homogeneous Hadamard manifolds. ;"Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Differential Geometry (math.DG)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01503;Spectra and stability of spatially periodic pulse patterns: Evans  function factorization via Riccati transformation; Björn de Rijk,  Arjen Doelman,  Jens Rademacher;  In the spectral stability analysis of localized patterns to singular perturbed evolution problems, one often encounters that the Evans function respects the scale separation. In such cases the Evans function of the full linear stability problem can be approximated by a product of a slow and a fast reduced Evans function, which correspond to properly scaled slow and fast singular limit problems. This feature has been used in several spectral stability analyses in order to reduce the complexity of the linear stability problem. In these studies the factorization of the Evans function was established via geometric arguments that need to be customized for the specific equations and solutions under consideration. In this paper we develop an alternative factorization method. In this analytic method we use the Riccati transformation and exponential dichotomies to separate slow from fast dynamics. We employ our factorization procedure to study the spectra associated with spatially periodic pulse solutions to a general class of multi-component, singularly perturbed reaction-diffusion equations. Eventually, we obtain expressions of the slow and fast reduced Evans functions, which describe the spectrum in the singular limit. The spectral stability of localized periodic patterns has so far only been investigated in specific models such as the Gierer-Meinhardt equations. Our spectral analysis significantly extends and formalizes these existing results. Moreover, it leads to explicit instability criteria. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

Moreover, under some further conditions on $V(x)$ we show that the ground states of GP equations are unique and radially symmetric at leat for almost every $a \in (0, a^*)$. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

We allow for finite time blow-up in the model as a mathematical construct to mimic the explosive increase in population, enabling the species to reach ""disastrous"" levels, in a finite time. We next propose various controls to drive down the invasive population growth and, in certain cases, eliminate blow-up. The controls avoid chemical treatments and/or natural enemy introduction, thus eliminating various non-target effects associated with such classical methods. We refer to these new controls as ""ecological damping"", as their inclusion dampens the invasive species population growth. Further, we improve prior results on the regularity and Turing instability of the three-species model that were derived in earlier work. Lastly, we confirm the existence of spatio-temporal chaos.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02685;Existence of entire solutions to a fractional Liouville equation in  $\mathbb{R}^n$; Ali Hyder;  We study the existence of solutions to the problem $$ (-\Delta)^{\frac{n}{2}}u = Qe^{nu}\quad\text{in }\mathbb{R}^n, \quad V := \int_{\mathbb{R}^n}e^{nu}dx < \infty,$$ where $Q=(n-1)!$ or $Q=-(n-1)!$. Extending the works of Wei-Ye and Hyder-Martinazzi to arbitrary odd dimension $n\geq 3$ we show that to a certain extent the asymptotic behavior of $u$ and the constant $V$ can be prescribed simultaneously. Furthermore if $Q=-(n-1)!$ then $V$ can be chosen to be any positive number. This is in contrast to the case $n=3$, $Q=2$, where Jin-Maalaoui-Martinazzi-Xiong showed that necessarily $V\le |S^3|$, and to the case $n=4$, $Q=6$, where C-S.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02715;Flow Characteristics in a Crowded Transport Model; Martin Burger,  Jan-Frederik Pietschmann;  The aim of this paper is to discuss the appropriate modelling of in- and outflow boundary conditions for nonlinear drift-diffusion models for the transport of particles including size exclusion and their effect on the behaviour of solutions. We use a derivation from a microscopic asymmetric exclusion process and its extension to particles entering or leaving on the boundaries. This leads to specific Robin-type boundary conditions for inflow and outflow, respectively. For the stationary equation we prove the existence of solutions in a suitable setup. Moreover, we investigate the flow characteristics for small diffusion, which yields the occurence of a maximal current phase in addition to well-known one-sided boundary layer effects for linear drift-diffusion problems. In a one-dimensional setup we provide rigorous estimates in terms of $\epsilon$, which confirm three different phases. Finally, we derive a numerical approach to solve the problem also in multiple dimensions. This provides further insight and allows for the investigation of more complicated geometric setups. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

Hassan Farshbaf-Shaker,  Christian Heinemann;"  In this work we investigate a phase field model for damage processes in two-dimensional viscoelastic media with nonhomogeneous Neumann data describing external boundary forces. In the first part we establish global-in-time existence, uniqueness, a priori estimates and continuous dependence of strong solutions on the data. The main difficulty is caused by the irreversibility of the phase field variable which results in a constrained PDE system. In the last part we consider an optimal control problem where a cost functional penalizes maximal deviations from prescribed damage profiles. The goal is to minimize the cost functional with respect to exterior forces acting on the boundary which play the role of the control variable in the considered model. To this end, we prove existence of minimizers and study a family of ""local"" approximations via adapted cost functionals.

We prove that solutions decay exponentially to $0$ or to stationary states in every form degree, and give an interpretation of the stationary states in terms of cohomological information of the spacetime. We also study the wave equation on differential forms and in particular prove analogous results on Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetimes. We demonstrate the stability of our analysis and deduce asymptotics and decay for solutions of Maxwell's equations, the Hodge-de Rham equation and the wave equation on differential forms on Kerr-de Sitter spacetimes with small angular momentum. ;"Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Spectral Theory (math.SP)"

In order to deduce asymptotics and decay from this, one in addition needs high energy estimates for the wave operator acting on sections of the form bundle. The present paper provides these on perturbations of Schwarzschild-de Sitter spaces in all spacetime dimensions $n\geq 4$. In fact, we prove exponential decay, up to a finite-dimensional space of resonances, of waves valued in any finite rank subbundle of the tensor bundle, which in particular includes differential forms and symmetric tensors. As the main technical tool for working on vector bundles that do not have a natural positive definite inner product, we introduce pseudodifferential inner products, which are inner products depending on the position in phase space. ;"Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Spectral Theory (math.SP)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03297;Mean field equations, hyperelliptic curves and modular forms: I; Ching-Li Chai,  Chang-Shou Lin,  Chin-Lung Wang;"  We develop a theory connecting the following three areas: (a) the mean field equation (MFE) $\triangle u + e^u = \rho\, \delta_0$, $\rho \in \mathbb R_{>0}$ on flat tori $E_\tau = \mathbb C/(\mathbb Z + \mathbb Z\tau)$, (b) the classical Lam\'e equations and (c) modular forms. A major theme in part I is a classification of developing maps $f$ attached to solutions $u$ of the mean field equation according to the type of transformation laws (or monodromy) with respect to $\Lambda$ satisfied by $f$. We are especially interested in the case when the parameter $\rho$ in the mean field equation is an integer multiple of $4\pi$. In the case when $\rho = 4\pi(2n + 1)$ for a non-negative integer $n$, we prove that the number of solutions is $n + 1$ except for a finite number of conformal isomorphism classes of flat tori, and we give a family of polynomials which characterizes the developing maps for solutions of mean field equations through the configuration of their zeros and poles. Modular forms appear naturally already in the simplest situation when $\,\rho=4\pi$. In the case when $\rho = 8\pi n$ for a positive integer $n$, the solvability of the MFE depends on the \emph{moduli} of the flat tori $E_\tau$ and leads naturally to a hyperelliptic curve $\bar X_n=\bar X_{n}(\tau)$ arising from the Hermite-Halphen ansatz solutions of Lam\'e's differential equation $\frac{d^2 w}{dz^2}-(n(n+1)\wp(z;\Lambda_{\tau}) + B) w=0$. We analyse the curve $\bar X_n$ from both the analytic and the algebraic perspective, including its local coordinate near the point at infinity, which turns out to be a smooth point of $\bar{X}_n$. We also specify the role of the branch points of the hyperelliptic projection $\bar X_n \to \mathbb P^1$ when the parameter $\rho$ varies in a neighborhood of $\rho = 8\pi n$.

Introducing a new family of energy estimates that combine probability and physical spaces, we prove the analyticity of the perturbed homogenized coefficients with respect to the Bernoulli parameter. Our approach holds under the minimal assumptions of stationarity and ergodicity, both in the scalar and vector cases, and gives analytical formulas for each derivative that essentially coincide with the so-called cluster expansion used by physicists. In particular, the first term yields the celebrated (electric and elastic) Clausius-Mossotti formulas for isotropic spherical random inclusions in an isotropic reference medium. This work constitutes the first general proof of these formulas in the case of random inclusions. ;"Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Probability (math.PR)"

It can be viewed as an elliptic regularization of the stationary Burgers 2D system. A motivation to consider the above system comes from an examination of unusual propetries of the linear operator $\lambda \sin y \partial_x w + (-\Delta)^{m} w$ arising from a linearization of the equation about the dominant part of $F$. We argue that the skew-symmetric part of the operator provides in some sense a smallness of norms of the linear operator inverse. Our analytical proof is valid for a particular force $F$ and for $\lambda > \lambda_0$, $m> m_0$ sufficiently large. The main steps of the proof concern finite dimension approximation of the system and concentrate on analysis of features of large matrices, which resembles standard numerical analysis. Our analytical results are illustrated by numerical simulations. ;"Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Numerical Analysis (math.NA)"

In this note we give a refinement of this theorem when the target is a closed orientable surface by taking into account an additional invariant of the problem, namely the topological degree. We show that the sharp energy threshold for global regularity and scattering is in fact twice the energy of the ground state for wave maps with degree zero, whereas wave maps with nonzero degree necessarily have at least the energy of the ground state. We also give a discussion on the formulation of a refined threshold conjecture for the energy critical $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills equation on (1+4)-dimensional Minkowski space. ;"Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)"

This generalizes the well-known ""morphological component analysis"" to a multi-measurement setting. The main result of the paper states that $f$ and the $g_{i}$'s can be uniquely and stably reconstructed by finding sparse representations of $h_{i}$ for every $i$ with respect to the concatenated dictionary $[A_{f},A_{g}]$, provided that enough incoherent measurements $g_{i}$ are available. The incoherence is measured in terms of their mutual disjoint sparsity. This method finds applications in the reconstruction procedures of several hybrid imaging inverse problems, where internal data are measured. These measurements usually consist of the main unknown multiplied by other unknown quantities, and so the disjoint sparsity approach can be directly applied. As an example, we show how to apply the method to the reconstruction in quantitative photoacoustic tomography, also in the case when the Gr\""uneisen parameter, the optical absorption and the diffusion coefficient are all unknown.

The regularity properties of $u$ are known to be closely related to the decay properties of the corresponding nonlinear Fourier coefficients. In this paper we obtain two-sided polynomial estimates of all integer Sobolev norms $||u||_m$, $m\ge 0$, in terms of the weighted norms of the nonlinear Fourier transformed, which are linear in the highest order. We further obtain quantitative estimates of the nonlinear Fourier transformed in arbitrary weighted Sobolev spaces. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04594;Codimension one threshold manifold for the critical gKdV equation; Yvan Martel,  Frank Merle,  Kenji Nakanishi,  Pierre Raphael;  We construct the 'threshold manifold' near the soliton for the mass critical gKdV equation, completing results obtained in arXiv:1204.4625 and arXiv:1204.4624. In a neighborhood of the soliton, this C1 manifold of codimension one separates solutions blowing up in finite time and solutions in the 'exit regime'. On the manifold, solutions are global in time and converge locally to a soliton. In particular, the soliton behavior is strongly unstable by blowup. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04602;Decay properties of solutions to the Cauchy problem for the scalar  conservation law with nonlinearly degenerate viscosity; Natsumi Yoshida;  In this paper, we study the decay rate in time to solutions of the Cauchy problem for the one-dimensional viscous conservation law where the far field states are prescribed. Especially, we deal with the case that the flux function which is convex and also the viscosity is a nonlinearly degenerate one (p-Laplacian type viscosity). As the corresponding Riemann problem admits a Riemann solution as the constant state or the single rarefaction wave, it has already been proved by Matsumura-Nishihara that the solution to the Cauchy problem tends toward the constant state or the single rarefaction wave as the time goes to infinity. We investigate that the decay rate in time of the corresponding solutions. Furthermore, we also investigate that the decay rate in time of the solution for the higher order derivative. These are the first result concerning the asymptotic decay of the solutions to the Cauchy problem of the scalar conservation law with nonlinear viscosity. The proof is given by L1, L2-energy and time-weighted Lq-energy methods. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04647;Completely monotone functions and some classes of fractional evolution  equations; Emilia Bazhlekova;  The abstract Cauchy problem for the distributed order fractional evolution equation in the Caputo and in the Riemann-Liouville sense is studied for operators generating a strongly continuous one-parameter semigroup on a Banach space. Continuous as well as discrete distribution of fractional time-derivatives of order less than one are considered. The problem is reformulated as an abstract Volterra integral equation. It is proven that its kernel satisfy certain complete monotonicity properties. Based on these properties, the well-posedness of the problem is established and a series expansion of the solution is obtained. In case of ordered Banach space this representation implies positivity of the solution operator. In addition, a subordination formula is obtained. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04680;On Serrin's overdetermined problem and a conjecture of Berestycki,  Caffarelli and Nirenberg; Kelei Wang,  Juncheng Wei;"  This paper concerns rigidity results to Serrin's overdetermined problem in an epigraph $$ \{\begin{aligned} &\Delta u+ f(u)=0,\ \ \ {in}\ \Omega=\{(x^\prime,x_n): x_n>\varphi (x^\prime)\},\\ &u>0,\ \ \ {in}\ \Omega,\\ &u=0,\ \ \ {on}\ \partial\Omega,\\ &|\nabla u|=const. {on} \partial\Omega. \end{aligned}. $$ We prove that up to isometry the epigraph must be an half space and that the solution $u$ must be one-dimensional, provided that one of the following assumptions are satisfied: either $n=2$; or $ \varphi $ is globally Lipschitz, or $n \leq 8$ and $ \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_n} >0$ in $\Omega$. In view of the counterexample constructed in \cite{DPW} in dimensions $n\geq 9$ this result is optimal. This partially answers a conjecture of Berestycki, Caffarelli and Nirenberg \cite{BCN}.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04720;The X-ray transform for connections in negative curvature; Colin Guillarmou,  Gabriel P. Paternain,  Mikko Salo,  Gunther Uhlmann;  We consider integral geometry inverse problems for unitary connections and skew-Hermitian Higgs fields on manifolds with negative sectional curvature. The results apply to manifolds in any dimension, with or without boundary, and also in the presence of trapped geodesics. In the boundary case, we show injectivity of the attenuated ray transform on tensor fields with values in a Hermitian bundle (i.e. vector valued case). We also show that a connection and Higgs field on a Hermitian bundle are determined up to gauge by the knowledge of the parallel transport between boundary points along all possible geodesics. The main tools are an energy identity, the Pestov identity with a unitary connection, which is presented in a general form, and a precise analysis of the singularities of solutions of transport equations when there are trapped geodesics. In the case of closed manifolds, we obtain similar results modulo the obstruction given by twisted conformal Killing tensors, and we also study this obstruction. ;"Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Differential Geometry (math.DG); Dynamical Systems (math.DS)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04725;A model of riots dynamics: shocks, diffusion and thresholds; Henri Berestycki,  Jean-Pierre Nadal,  Nancy Rodriguez;  We introduce and analyze several variants of a system of differential equations which model the dynamics of social outbursts, such as riots. The systems involve the coupling of an explicit variable representing the intensity of rioting activity and an underlying (implicit) field of social tension. Our models include the effects of exogenous and endogenous factors as well as various propagation mechanisms. From numerical and mathematical analysis of these models we show that the assumptions made on how different locations influence one another and how the tension in the system disperses play a major role on the qualitative behavior of bursts of social unrest. Furthermore, we analyze here various properties of these systems, such as the existence of traveling wave solutions, and formulate some new open mathematical problems which arise from our work. ;"Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04731;A weighted minimum gradient problem with complete electrode model  boundary conditions for conductivity imaging; Adrian Nachman,  Alexandru Tamasan,  Johann Veras;  We consider the inverse problem of recovering an isotropic electrical conductivity from interior knowledge of the magnitude of one current density field generated by applying current on a set of electrodes. The required interior data can be obtained by means of MRI measurements. On the boundary we only require knowledge of the electrodes, their impedances, and the corresponding average input currents. From the mathematical point of view, this practical question leads us to consider a new weighted minimum gradient problem for functions satisfying the boundary conditions coming from the Complete Electrode Model of Somersalo, Cheney and Isaacson. This variational problem has non-unique solutions. The surprising discovery is that the physical data is still sufficient to determine the geometry of the level sets of the minimizers. In particular, we obtain an interesting phase retrieval result: knowledge of the input current at the boundary allows determination of the full current vector field from its magnitude. We characterize the non-uniqueness in the variational problem. We also show that additional measurements of the voltage potential along one curve joining the electrodes yield unique determination of the conductivity. A nonlinear algorithm is proposed and implemented to illustrate the theoretical results. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04732;Global Estimates for Generalized Forchheimer Flows of Slightly  Compressible Fluids; Luan Hoang,  Thinh Kieu;"  This paper is focused on the generalized Forchheimer flows of slightly compressible fluids in porous media. They are reformulated as a degenerate parabolic equation for the pressure. The initial boundary value problem is studied with time-dependent Dirichlet boundary data. The estimates up to the boundary and for all time are derived for the $L^\infty$-norm of the pressure, its gradient and time derivative. Large-time estimates are established to be independent of the initial data. Particularly, thanks to the special structure of the pressure's nonlinear equation, the global gradient estimates are obtained in a relatively simple way, avoiding complicated calculations and a prior requirement of H\""older estimates.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04735;Analysis of a model for the dynamics of riots; Henri Berestycki,  Nancy Rodriguez;  This paper is concerned with modeling the dynamics of social outbursts of activity, such as protests or rioting activity. In this sequel to our work in \cite{Berestycki2014}, written in collaboration with J-P. Nadal, we model the effect of restriction of information and explore the effects that it has on the existence of {\it upheaval waves}. The systems involve the coupling of an explicit variable representing the intensity of rioting activity and an underlying (implicit) field of social tension. We prove the existence of global solutions to the Cauchy problem in $\mathbb{R}^d$ as well as the existence of {\it traveling wave solutions} under certain parameter regimes. We furthermore explore the effects of heterogeneities in the environment with the help of numerical simulations, which leads to pulsating waves in certain cases. We analyze the effects of periodic domains as well as the {\it barrier} problem with the help of numerical simulations and discuss many open problems. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04750;Decay properties of solutions toward a multiwave pattern to the Cauchy  problem for the scalar conservation law with degenerate flux and viscosity; Natsumi Yoshida;  In this paper, we study the precise decay rate in time to solutions of the Cauchy problem for the one-dimensional conservation law with a nonlinearly degenerate viscosity where the far field states are prescribed. Especially, we deal with the case when the flux function is convex or concave but linearly degenerate on some interval. As the corresponding Riemann problem admits a Riemann solution as a multiwave pattern which consists of the rarefaction waves and the contact discontinuity, it has already been proved by Yoshida that the solution to the Cauchy problem tends toward the linear combination of the rarefaction waves and contact wave for p-Laplacian type viscosity as the time goes to infinity. We investigate that the decay rate in time of the corresponding solutions toward the multiwave pattern. Furthermore, we also investigate that the decay rate in time of the solution for the higher order derivative. The proof is given by L1, L2-energy and time-weighted Lq-energy methods under the use of the precise asymptotic properties of the interactions between the nonlinear waves. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

Specifically, we prove that if $v$ is a smooth solution to (NS) satisfying $\omega={\rm curl}\,v \in L^q (\Bbb R^3) $ for some $\frac32 \leq q< 3$, and $|v(x)|\to 0$ as $|x|\to +\infty$, then either $v=0$ on $\Bbb R^3$, or $\int_{\Bbb R^6} \Phi_+ dxdy=\int_{\Bbb R^6} \Phi_- dxdy=+\infty$, where $\Phi(x,y) :=\frac{1}{4\pi}\frac{\omega (x)\cdot(x-y)\times (v(y)\times \omega(y) )}{|x-y|^3} $, and $\Phi_\pm:=\max\{ 0, \pm \Phi\}$. The proof uses crucially the structure of nonlinear term of the equations. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04902;Analysis of the diffuse domain approach for a bulk-surface coupled PDE  system; Helmut Abels,  Kei Fong Lam,  Björn Stinner;  We analyse a diffuse interface type approximation, known as the diffuse domain approach, of a linear coupled bulk-surface elliptic partial differential system. The well-posedness of the diffuse domain approximation is shown using weighted Sobolev spaces and we prove that the solution to the diffuse domain approximation converges weakly to the solution of the coupled bulk-surface elliptic system as the approximation parameter tends to zero. Moreover, we can show strong convergence for the bulk quantity, while for the surface quantity, we can show norm convergence and strong convergence in a weighted Sobolev space. Our analysis also covers a second order surface elliptic partial differential equation and a bulk elliptic partial differential equation with Dirichlet, Neumann and Robin boundary condition. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)

We do not assume that the limiting equation possesses a unique equilibrium and do not impose roughness on the noise. This allows to provide the first such result in the PDE setting. ;"Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Probability (math.PR)"

https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05060;Gaining two derivatives on a singular force in the 2D Navier-Stokes  equations; Alexey Cheskidov,  Landon Kavlie;  It has long been known, for the autonomous 2D Navier-Stokes equations with singular forcing, that there exist unique solutions which gain one derivative, globally. On the other hand, if the forcing term smooth enough, it is known that the solution gains two derivatives globally. In this paper, we explore classical techniques to show that if the force is sufficiently smooth, then the solution gains two derivatives globally. These methods break down when the force becomes singular. In this scenario, we use a Littlewood-Paley decomposition in Fourier space to show that a solutions gain two derivatives locally in time and the interval of time depends only on the size of the initial data. ;Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
